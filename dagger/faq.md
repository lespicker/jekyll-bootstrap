# Frequently Asked Questions

**How long did it take you to write The Dagger of Isis?**

From start to finish, about eight months.

**Where did the idea come from?**

Once I had completed **The First Pharaoh** about King Narmer and his struggles to unite Upper and Lower Egypt into one lasting kingdom, I knew the tale wasn't over. In my research and in visits to Egypt, I learned about an incredible woman, Meryt-Neith, who served as regent king for her son after the death of her husband. She was highly revered by her people and the power brokers since she was given a prominent tomb in a very holy place. I knew I had to tell her story.

**Are the details all true?**

While we know some things about Meryt-Neith's life there was simply not enough detail around which I felt I could weave a compelling story. In a way that was a blessing, since I did not feel constrained by historical fact. This is, after all, historical fiction. 

**What kind of research did you do?**

Of course, in researching and writing **The First Pharaoh** I had already done quite a bit of research. I have had the privilege of visiting Egypt before and actually seeing the sites about which I would eventually write. 

I also did a great deal of reading and Internet research, corresponding with experts and actually visiting with experts like Dr. Toby Wilkinson of Cambridge University, England. 

I'm an inveterate researcher and have to stop myself at some point in order to actually start writing.

**Was Meryt-Neith real?**
Most definitely so. She was real and respected. Her tomb is placed in such a way as to have access to a holy rift between two small desert mountains. This rift was considered a divine passage to the next life. 

Meryt-Neith ruled for about 17 years, until her son was old enough to become King in his own right. 

**Was Wadjet (Djet) real?**
Yes. He is recorded as a First Dynasty King and was buried in a tomb in Abydos. We also know his reign was short-lived and that Meryt-Neith succeeded him. The line of succession was Narmer, Hor-Aha, Djer (Wadjer), Djet (Wadjet), Meryt-Neith, Den (Wadjden). 

**What about Nubiti and Bakht?**

Novelists have to conjure up characters to challenge our protagonists and spur them on to growth and great accomplishments. That was the genesis of Nubiti and Bakht. However, they are based on real characters, traits that are universal, and/or events that are in the historical record at some point in Egypt's long and glorious history. 

**Surely Herihor was real?**

Yes, no and maybe. It is certainly likely that all the early kings had a military chief to take care of armed struggles. This role became more formalized as Egypt matured. So, I extrapolated back from what we know from the historical record in later dynasties to my creation of the Herihor character.
