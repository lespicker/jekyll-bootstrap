# Frequently Asked Questions

**How did you get the idea for <em>The Underground?</em>** 

The honest-to-God truth is that I dreamt it! I had a nightmare one night that was so vivid I awoke and realized I had just been given a gift. I raced downstairs and spent the next 3 hours outlining what I had dreamed (with some embellishments, of course!). That was the nucleus of *The Underground.*

**How long did it take to write it?**

About six months.

**What is your writing process like?**

The answer to that can be found on my writing home page. 

**Are any of the characters based on real people?**

That one's simple. No. 

**How did you nail the rural West Virginia accent?**

First, I lived in North Carolina for two years and did some work in rural West Virginia as a consultant. I love listening to different languages and dialects. I deplore the fact that our dialects in this country are becoming homogenized. The dialogue in my novels is never meant as anything other than the highest compliment to its users. 

**How did you know the details of New York City adoptions?**

Isn't the Internet wonderful? I did some basic research and then proceeded to bend a few of the facts. Hey, this is fiction, right?
