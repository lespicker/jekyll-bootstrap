### A Dream Book

No, I mean that literally! At 3:00 A.M. one winter night I awoke from a disturbing dream that was so vivid I could actually smell and feel parts of the scenes. It was one of those chasing-type dreams, although n this case I was more an observer than one of the actors. I could not get back to sleep, so I got up and went downstairs. I felt I had the makings of a story.

By 7:00 A.M. I had outlined the entire novel, a first for me since I usually struggle for weeks with my outlines. And once the writing began, the story just flowed. Amazing, really. 

### Researching the Novel

Since I was born and spent my first 19 years in New York City, I felt that I had that part of the research pretty well sewn up. However, I still hard to research certain facts and also visited a few locales to add realism and descriptive elements to the scenes. 

It was the West Virginia segments that required extensive research. I live in Maryland, so I made several trips to the western Maryland region that borders West Virginia and decided to center the action there. 

### Writing

The actual writing took place in about four months of intensive writing, although that was a rare exception. Most of my books took far longer to write. People often ask me about the mechanics of my writing, so here's a quick description. 

I'm a pretty disciplined writer. I get up fairly early, have breakfast and read the papers, then get online to catch up on late-breaking news, read and answer emails, and other minor tasks. By 10:00 I am writing and do so until lunch. After lunch I do other stuff until my post-lunch glucose plunge is over and then I write again. After dinner, I usually do some editing and get organized for the next day. Real life events all too often interfere with this schedule. If I can do this 3-4 days a week I'm happy.

Once I complete the first draft of the manuscript I let it sit for a minimum of a week. Then the painful revision process begins. I typically go through at least 3 or 4 revisions, although my historical fiction novel, **The First Pharaoh**, took 9! I edit to add more descriptive details, to improve the dialogue, to catch inconsistencies and to add plot elements that I think might add drama, intrigue or conflict. Sometimes I'll scrap an entire chapter or remove a piece of the story that was spread out throughout the book.

Once that process is done, I reluctantly hand off my manuscript to my first-line editor, my wife. She is a grammarian and eagle-eyed editor. Best of all, she gives me a woman's perspective on what works (or, more likely, what doesn't). 

After my wife comes my long-time friend and writing buddy, Terry, who reads the manuscript and gives me lots of feedback. Usually my manuscript looks like it's been through a war when he returns it. Every other page seems to bleed red ink.

At this point I'll make final revisions and then it's ready for you!
