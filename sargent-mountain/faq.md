# Sargent Mountain

## FAQ

**Why do you spell Sargent as you did?**

Sargent Mountain is the actual name of a mountain in Acadia National Park on Maine's Mt. Desert Island. It is named after the Sargent family. 

**How did you get the idea for Sargent Mountain?**

I lived in Maine for ten years and received my doctorate in ecology from the University of Maine. Some of my research was done in Acadia National Park and I have climbed its trails for the past 40 years. 

Having hiked there with my children over the years, I grew particularly fond of Sargent Mountain. That led me to craft the story that revolves around the natural history of Sargent Mountain. 

At the time I wrote **Sargent Mountain**, I was living on a small farm, in the area in Maryland described in the book. After a painful divorce, I sat down to write as part of the healing process. I thought a lot about loss and over a period of two weeks, the entire story began to take shape. I began to think not about my loss, but about the loss that others feel.

**Is the story autobiographical?**

I sure hope not, since the lead male character is dead when the book opens. But, like all novels, we writers draw a little from our own experiences, a little from what we observe in others, and mix in a dash of research for seasoning. That stew is what became**Sargent Mountain.**

**How do approach the task of writing?**

Please see my Frequently Asked Questions section on my writing home page for the answer to this question. 

**Who did the cover art for your book?**

Damon at www.damonza.com. He is fantastic to work with. I recommend him highly.
