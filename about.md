## About Me

I guess one could make a case that I am professionally schizophrenic. There are three sides of me: fiction writer, non-fiction writer, and photographer. 

## Fiction Writing

![Les Picker](/images/les.jpg)There is nothing like a well-spun yarn. Ever since I was a child I would spend hours, alone in my room, wandering through the magical worlds created by the likes of Jules Verne, Robert Heinlein, John Steinbeck. After winning a 5th grade writing contest, I swore that one day I would be a writer. 

So far I have written and published four novels, each of which is described on other web pages within this site. Two of my novels are part of what will eventually be a trilogy, about the First Dynasty of ancient Egypt. 

*The First Pharaoh* tells the story of one of the most incredible men in history, King Narmer, who united Upper and Lower Egypt into one Dynasty that lasted for more than 3,000 years. *The First Pharaoh* describes his life and loves, the challenges within the court, and the wars he fought to unite his people. 

*The Dagger of Isis* tells the story of King Narmer's great-granddaughter, Meryt-Neith, who ruled Egypt for 18 years as regent for her son. We witness Meryt-Neith's lifelong rivalry with her cousin, Nubiti, her battles to keep Egypt united, and her struggle to protect her son from sinister forces until he comes of age. 

I am currently writing the final book in the trilogy. 

*Sargent Mountain* is a work of general fiction. It tells the story of Rose, a middle-aged woman, who finds out after her husband dies that he had a long-term affair with another woman, as unlike Rose as any woman could be. A chance encounter with 'the other woman' propels the novel forward, as Rose seeks to make sense of this shattering revelation. 

*The Underground* follows Lisa, a reporter who, after the death of her father, finds out that her birth mother was murdered. Soon nothing is as she thought it was. Her life is turned upside down as she seeks to find out the truth about her mother… and her father, who raised her. Her journey takes her far away and brings her closer to her roots.


## Non-Fiction Writing

On the non-fiction side,I have more than 600 writing credits in Forbes, Better Homes & Gardens, Time, Inc. Publications, Money, Fortune Small Business, Bloomberg Personal Finance, National Parks, and dozens of other publications. I’m a former newspaper reporter and editor, for three years was a columnist for Oceans Magazine and for four years was Editor-In-Chief for a national environmental journal. My photography has also appeared in National Geographic Society publications and many other magazines and newspapers. I’m a proud member of the American Society of Journalists and Authors (ASJA), Hasselblad Professionals and Nikon Professional Services.

For four years I was a weekly columnist for The Baltimore Sun and continue as a feature travel writer and photographer. For three years, I was a regular commentator on National Public Radio's Marketplace, carried on 260 stations nationwide. I have written books about macular degeneration and winter ecology. 

## Photography

I have been photographing since age 11, when my father gave me my first camera. Since then I have photographed for major magazines and newspapers. I have been featured in gallery shows and my fine art images hang in offices, hospitals and private homes. In 2011 I was honored to receive the prestigious Canada Northern Lights Award for best travel photography. I also conduct photo workshops and tours for [Nikonians Academy](http://www.nikoniansacademy.com).

I’m passionate about both my writing and photography and consider myself incredibly fortunate to earn a living doing what I love every day.
