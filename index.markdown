###The First Pharaoh

[![The First Pharaoh](images/thumb/pharaoh.jpg)](/pharaoh/) Throughout antiquity Egypt was a land of hundreds of tiny  villages, with constantly warring tribes, loosely divided between Upper and Lower Egypt. Then, in the space of a few extraordinary decades, the impossible happened. An incredible man, King Narmer (also known as Menes), united Upper and Lower Egypt. 

The First Pharaoh is the story of Narmer and his epic journey, seen through his eyes and those of his Chief Scribe, the shaman Anhotek. We experience the culture Narmer lived in and shaped, the battles he fought to unite his people, the woman he loved and nearly lost, the enemies even in his own court who plotted against him, and his many successes and painful failures. Above all, we see how Narmer’s loving relationship with Anhotek defined his personal vision for his country and its people. 

Written on a huge tapestry, The First Pharaoh allows us to share Narmer’s far-reaching visions for Egypt’s future that were so compelling and that ultimately proved so enduring. The First Pharaoh tells the inspiring story of the mythic journey of the visionary hero, through obstacles and triumphs, wars and peace, love and hate, to launch the greatest civilization ever to appear on earth.
