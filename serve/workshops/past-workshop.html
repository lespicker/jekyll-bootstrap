		<h2>Latest Workshop</h2>

<h3>Acadia National Park, Mt. Desert Island, Maine</h3>

<p>This 4-day workshop took place in October, 2012 in Maine&#8217;s iconic Acadia National Park. For landscape artists few places can beat it, with its rocky coast, evergreen forests, streams, lakes, waterfalls and moss-cushioned woods. (All images were taken by workshop participants).</p>

<p>The workshop was offered through <a href="http://www.nikoniansacademy.com/viewFacultyPage.html?page_id=7">Nikonians Academy</a>, where I am on the faculty. Nine participants attended (the tenth had to miss due to a family medical emergency).</p>

<p>Our itinerary looked something like this:</p>

<p><strong>Thursday evening</strong>: Introductions, orientations and an introductory lecture/discussion.</p>

<p><strong>Friday</strong>: two shoots in the morning (including sunrise) and two in the afternoon; evening critique session. Snacks and water are always available in Les&#8217; vehicle.</p>

<p><strong>Saturday</strong>: Heavy rain in the morning, so we had a show-and-tell session, sharing our techniques, favorite equipment and knowledge. By afternoon we were out again, photographing a waterfall. Evening critique session.</p>

<p><strong>Sunday</strong>: Sunrise shoot, followed by two other locales, followed by a sunset shoot at Bass Harbor Lighthouse. Evening critique session.</p>

<p><strong>Monday</strong>: morning shoot at two locations. Feedback session, followed by goodbyes at noon.</p>

<p>Since everyone was able to arrive on site early on Friday afternoon, I squeezed in an extra photo shoot for them prior to our opening session.</p>

<p>Lunches and dinners were enjoyed together, over micro-brew beers, nice wines and lots of laughter.</p>

<p>Here are some comments from participants:</p>

<blockquote><p>I recently returned from a Nikonians workshop led by Les Picker at Acadia National Park. In a word it was outstanding. Les is an excellent teacher, photographer and leader. He was extremely knowledgeable about the Park and scouted out several beautiful photo venues in advance. He offered solid and comprehensive shooting tips geared to our individual needs and provided insightful feed back after each shoot. Perhaps most important he provided additional opportunity to review and improve our images after we returned home from the workshop. He was genuinely interested in our progress and it didn&#8217;t end with the workshop.I recommend the workshop without reservation and look forward to attending another one with him.<cite>Lewis Rothman, M.D., New York City</cite></p>

<p>Eight other folks and I spent the better part of four photography-packed days exploring Mt. Desert Island under Les Picker&#8217;s guidance. His depth of knowledge of the landscape, history and biology of the island informed our photography and took us to places that most other workshops just don&#8217;t see. Les provided itineraries that were well-balanced between iconic locations (Cadillac Mountain, Bass Harbor Lighthouse) and out-of-the-way gems. When the weather turned against us Saturday morning, he led a stimulating, free-wheeling discussion in which all of the participants shared freely some of their favorite tools and photographic tricks. That afternoon we capitalized on the rain with a hike to Hemlock Falls (in full flow!) on Parkman Mountain. Each evening we capped the day&#8217;s work with a review of the day&#8217;s events and Les&#8217; insightful critiques of a few of our images.</p>

<p>Les proved to be a great workshop instructor. He was attentive to the varied skill levels and needs that all of us brought to the event and was readily available in the field to provide technical assistance and one-on-one teaching. As someone who probably has better technique than vision, I really appreciated his gentle challenges to try new things.</p>

<p>To sum up, this was a great experience! Mt. Desert Island and Acadia National Park in the fall are unbelievably beautiful, and Les Picker allowed us to take maximum advantage of our time there. I know that he is planning to offer this workshop again next year, and I can recommend it without reservation.<cite>Dave Soderlund, Ithaca, New York</cite></p>

<p>This workshop was a special experience at multiple levels: image creation, learning, and in the case of this particular workshop enjoying the camaraderie of a diverse group of people that quickly bonded sharing their passion for photography and enjoying each others company.  Les Picker was the key to creating this experience   Les&#8217; in depth knowledge of Acadia enabled him to guide the group to a diverse set of sites on a off the beaten path, sunrise to sunset.  His gracious style in sharing his artistic and technical expertise set the tone for the group dynamics. Post shoot discussions were nicely balanced between a focus on developing an eye for the creative image and technical / practical tips and techniques.  Les&#8217; knowledge of the history and flora of Acadia enriched the experience.<cite>Thomas E. Wilson, North Sandwich, NH</cite></p></blockquote>
