		  <div class="entry-content"><p>Bob, my associate, and I were taking a lunch break from testing print profiles for <a href="http://www.museofineart.com">Museo Fine Art papers</a> for our <a href="http://www.lesterpickerphoto.com/workshops/upcoming-workshops.html">upcoming workshop this fall in Maine</a>. We got into a discussion about capturing images of local and indigenous people when traveling. It&#8217;s one of those infrequent times that Bob and I completely agreed about an issue that has many times gotten us into a rage, as it turns out.</p>

<p>The conversation started out innocently enough, as we discussed what lenses we prefer to capture people. Bob prefers a 50mm and he has a collection of them that rivals anyone&#8217;s. As for me, I&#8217;m eclectic, preferring a super wide angle (my Nikkor 14-24 or 17-35) in some circumstances and my Nikkor 24-70 in most others. On occasion I have even used my Nikkor 70-200 when I can&#8217;t get close to my subject, perhaps while they are involved in a native ceremony or other activity.</p>

<p><a href="http://blog.lesterpickerphoto.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/06/LAP2568.jpg"><img class="size-medium wp-image-2824" title="_LAP2568" src="http://blog.lesterpickerphoto.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/06/LAP2568-200x300.jpg" alt="" width="200" height="300"></a></p>

<p> </p>

<h3>Tools of Ignorance</h3>


<p>That conversation led us into the methods that photographers use to capture travel portraits. The behavior that drives us up a wall are those photographers who try to sneakily capture people serruptitiously, using telephoto lenses. Then there are the drive-by-shooting artists who stick a camera into an unsuspecting local&#8217;s face and snap away, sometimes over their objections.</p>

<p>Do these people realize how crude they are being? Do they understand how their selfish behavior ruins the opportunity for photographers who follow in their wake? Is snagging the image so important they are obviously willing to throw ethical and humane considerations out the window? In their hands, photographic equipment becomes tools of ignorance.</p>

<h3>It&#8217;s About Time… and Relationships</h3>


<p>If there is one thing I try to emphasize with travel photography that involves people, it&#8217;s that it takes time. It&#8217;s not just about rushing from here to there to see this site or that. The best travel experiences of my life involve taking the time to talk to a person, find out who they are, talk about family, show the subject how much you enjoy their country.</p>

<p> </p>

<p><a href="http://blog.lesterpickerphoto.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/06/2006-11-ecuador1746.jpg"><img class="size-medium wp-image-2825" title="Winning Smile" src="http://blog.lesterpickerphoto.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/06/2006-11-ecuador1746-200x300.jpg" alt="" width="200" height="300"></a></p>

<p> </p>

<p>Taking the time to understand your subject builds relationship and that invariably leads to better photographs. When you get to know your subjects, even if only a tad bit more than when you first came upon them, you success rate for capturing their &#8220;essence&#8221; will improve markedly. It will also increase the rate at which people agree to have you photograph them. Some of the people I have photographed I have become friends with to this day.</p>

<p> </p>

<p><a href="http://blog.lesterpickerphoto.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/06/abdelzahersister2_edited-1.jpg"><img class="size-medium wp-image-2826" title="Bedouin Mother" src="http://blog.lesterpickerphoto.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/06/abdelzahersister2_edited-1-239x300.jpg" alt="" width="239" height="300"></a></p>

<p> </p>

<p>In a previous blog on <a href="http://blog.lesterpickerphoto.com/2010/02/13/photographing-people/">tips to create better people pictures</a>, I alluded to the time and relationship issues, but I wanted to be a bit more forceful about it here. So, please, if you photograph people surreptitiously, rethink that approach. And if you are the kind that insultingly sticks a camera in a foreigner&#8217;s face, please think of how arrogant that action is and commit to change. In the end you&#8217;ll be helping yourself and your fellow photographers. And, thanks.</p>

<p>PS: If you are serious about photographing people while traveling, try my e-book on the topic:<a href="http://shop.lesterpickerphoto.com/page/102"><strong><em> The Photographer&#8217;s Eye: People</em></strong></a>, available at <a href="http://shop.lesterpickerphoto.com/">my store</a>. Hope you enjoy it!</p>

		  <div class="entry-content"><p>As a professional landscape, wildlife and travel photographer, I eagerly awaited the arrival of my <a href="http://www.gigapan.com">Gigapan Epic Pro</a> test unit. I had been reading a lot of press about this techno-marvel, and was especially impressed by George Lepp’s experience. George is a veteran photographer who I admire.</p>

<p>I should also mention that here at <a href="http://www.lesterpickerphoto.com">Les Picker Fine Art Photography</a> we produce some very large images for my clients. Nowadays a 30”x40” print is average size for us. We have done murals for clients that range from 17-feet wide and ten feet tall to <a href="http://blog.lesterpickerphoto.com/2012/09/17/wallpaper-mural/">30-feet x 10-feet</a> and <a href="http://blog.lesterpickerphoto.com/2012/11/16/a-les-picker-fine-art-installation/">I’ve blogged about those installations before</a>. To create eye-popping oversized prints pixel density is critical. Blowing up a 12-megapixel image just can’t cut it. Even my 36-megapixel Nikon D800 would be taxed when creating an 8-foot print. Enter Gigapan.</p>

<p> </p>

<h3>Gigapan</h3>


<p>Gigapan was initially created by scientists at NASA and Carnegie Mellon University in Pittsburgh to take ultra-high resolution images for applications such as the lunar and Mars rovers. The theory behind it is that you photograph a scene in pieces, each with a telephoto lens, you then piece the image together and thereby get absolutely huge pixel counts with tons of definition in the resulting image. Once the photo system was deployed, they commercialized it and created the Gigapan system for our non-robotic arms.</p>

<p><a href="http://blog.lesterpickerphoto.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/06/DSC_1125.jpg"><img class="size-medium wp-image-2811" title="DSC_1125" src="http://blog.lesterpickerphoto.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/06/DSC_1125-200x300.jpg" alt="" width="200" height="300"></a></p>

<p> </p>

<p>So when my test unit arrived from Gigapan, I unboxed it, quickly tested it on my deck and immediately loaded it into a separate backpack to take with me to Colorado’s most wondrous Garden of the Gods to put it through its paces. The adventure had begun.</p>

<p> </p>

<p><a href="http://blog.lesterpickerphoto.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/06/DSC_7575-Panorama.jpg"><img class="size-medium wp-image-2810" title="DSC_7575 Panorama" src="http://blog.lesterpickerphoto.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/06/DSC_7575-Panorama-300x94.jpg" alt="" width="300" height="94"></a></p>

<h3></h3>


<h3>Off, But Not Running</h3>


<p>The first thing I have to report is that the Gigapan is a beast to carry. I am a “senior” photographer, but I still hike all day in mountainous terrain with 30 pounds of gear on my back. I simply could not imagine hauling a Gigapan in addition. It is both bulky and heavy, especially since you will need to carry at least two batteries. Gigapan even sells a tailored backpack to house the unit, but I tried to make do with a single, large LowePro Trekker AW400 (<a href="http://blog.lesterpickerphoto.com/2011/12/07/the-lowepro-trekker-aw400%E2%80%A6-a-backpack-on-steroids/">click here</a> for my review of that pack).</p>

<p>That’s why I field tested it at the Garden of the Gods, since I knew I could drive to various locations there and put it to the test only yards from my rental car.</p>

<p>As it turned out, my first day of shooting was a breeze, primarily because there were no breezes, but I’ll get to that later. The initial setup of the day was laborious. The unit has to be attached to a sturdy tripod (I use a Gitzo 3541) and various parts must be assembled. Then the camera and lens has to be mounted. You also must also have pre-determined your parallax (nodal) point in order to mount the camera properly to capture good panos. I used a Nikon D800 for the tests, with a 70-200mm or a 200-400mm Nikkor lens attached. The tripod must also be leveled.</p>

<h3></h3>


<h3>Ready, Set, Set, Set, Go!</h3>


<p>Once mounted, the menu setup is reasonably simple. The Gigapan base has a screen that walks you through the menu items in sequence. Once that is done, you simply move the camera to the upper right and let the camera know that is where you would like the pano to start. Then you move it to the lower right using its mechanical movements to tell it where you want the pano to end. The unit then calculates how many images are needed to capture the scene, given the lens and focal length you’ve specified during menu setup. Press a button and VOILA! The camera/lens automagically points to the upper left of the scene, clicks, then moves to the next spot in the sequence, click, until it ends on the bottom right.</p>

<p>There are even ways to tweak your setup. For example, if you want to minimize camera shake, you can program your camera for mirror lock-up and Gigapan will adjust. You can even do a series of bracketed exposures at each capture station (although the directions I got with the unit were unclear on how to do this… you have to have mirror-up set on both the camera and the Gigapan). Also, bracketing on the D800 is limited by Nikon to 1 EV increments, meaning that you will need to take 5 excruciatingly slow captures to get 2 EV increments.</p>

<p>The results of a Gigapan session can be amazing, showing detail you can hardly imagine. Witness this image I took at Garden of the Gods using 63 separate exposures. I imported the images into Lightroom 4, exported them as TIFFs to PTGUI which stitched them together easily, then imported the resulting TIFF back into LR4. A couple of adjustment tweaks later and here it is.</p>

<p><a href="http://blog.lesterpickerphoto.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/06/pano.jpg"><img class="size-medium wp-image-2812" title="pano" src="http://blog.lesterpickerphoto.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/06/pano-300x88.jpg" alt="" width="300" height="88"></a></p>

<p> </p>

<h3>The Rest of the Story</h3>


<p>So why is it that I returned the unit to Gigpan after the trial and won’t be purchasing one, at least not now? The simple answer is that I simply cannot incorporate it into my fieldwork. It is that bulky and heavy. I work alone and sometimes hike for 10 hours a day in rugged terrain. Even on my recent trip to Italy I would not consider schlepping it along. However, if you are the type of photographer who plans to drive to your destinations, the bulk and weight objection may not be pertinent.</p>

<p>Unfortunately, there are a few other issues that made me decide against the Gigapan. First, the build quality is not what I expected. The bracket that holds the camera, for example, is flimsier than it should be, especially when mounting a DSLR with a 200-400 zoom. In fact, Really Right Stuff sells a replacement bracket for the Gigapan that is far sturdier, but also costly, adding $140-$270 to the Gigapan Epic Pro’s $895 price tag.</p>

<p>This brings up my next issue with the Gigapan unit. It is not stable enough in operation for pro-quality results in some environmental situations. With a DSLR and 200-400 mounted, the camera/lens shakes for 4-6 seconds after it comes to a stop. Gigapan builds in a “solution” to handle that. You can dial in a delay of as many seconds as you need to allow the setup to stabilize. Unfortunately, that brings up the next objection that I have to the process. Think of it; if you build in the stabilizing delay and a mirror-lockup delay and the movement from position to position delay, one 63-image pano can take 10-15 or more minutes to complete! That’s long enough for the lighting and clouds to change radically. That happened to me several times, which means that you have an impossible post-processing job to open shadows or tone down blown highlights.</p>

<p>Further complicating this scenario is that the Gigapan is virtually useless in even moderate winds. The unit acts like a sail and in my experience the camera never stopped shaking even after the 6-second delay, making all of my panos that second day completely unusable. I hung my 30-pound backpack on the tripod, and it helped only slightly.</p>

<p>Finally, the battery, while quite big and heavy, does not last long with the setup I had. In Gigapan’s defense it takes a lot of power to manipulate a Nikon D800 and monster 200-400 lens. But I had to carry two very heavy batteries to get through even half a day’s shoot.</p>

<p> </p>

<h3>Final Thoughts</h3>


<p>In the final analysis, I feel as if I can do as good a job using mechanical tools for my panos, like the Really Right Stuff pano equipment, even for multi-row captures. I would surely capture the pano far faster so as not to miss a once-in-a-lifetime lighting opportunity.  In fact I shot the following panos on the Gigapan and then did the same with my RRS setup in ¼ the time. The images here are the ones I took with my RRS setup or my 24mm tilt-shift.</p>

<p> </p>

<p>Despite my misgivings- and I remind you that this review is only one person’s opinion-  the Gigapan Epic Pro is a lot of fun to operate and it certainly draws a crowd. For me that’s the kiss of death, since one of the prime reasons I do landscape/nature photography is for the solitude that allows me to appreciate the beauty that surrounds me and focus on the tasks at hand. But I can see that Gigapan has wide appeal (they’ve sold a bunch of these babies) to those who can appreciate its merits and can deal with the issues I raised in this review.</p>

<p>I do think that Gigapan will continue to develop the product and I can see a time when my calculus will change in favor of Gigapan. But, until then, I plan to stick with my tested and true method of capturing panos. In fact, I&#8217;ve already done two blogs on the topic (<a href="http://blog.lesterpickerphoto.com/2012/08/21/panoramas-nail-your-nodal-points/">Part 1</a> and <a href="http://blog.lesterpickerphoto.com/2012/09/02/panoramas-part-2-how-i-do-it/">Part 2</a>) and I’ll plan to do more how-to blogs.</p>

<p>As always, I welcome comments, divergent opinions and suggestions.</p>

		  <div class="entry-content"><p>I just returned from a 30-day photo excursion to Italy, Sicily, the Egadi Islands and Malta, a trip that caused me not a small amount of angst before we left. That’s because I usually lug around some 30-40 pounds (14-18 kg) of equipment with me on my landscape adventures, including a Gitzo 3541 tripod with a Really Right Stuff ballhead that alone clocks in at 8 pounds! I needed some real neck and back relief!</p>

<p>Enter the 4-pound (1.8 kg) <a href="http://www.mefoto.com/">MeFoto tripod</a>, complete with ballhead, that I had come across while doing some research. Europe is not exactly the best place to lug around a bulky tripod, due to the incessant crowds and narrow spaces. I needed something light and very portable.</p>

<p><a href="http://blog.lesterpickerphoto.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/06/DSC_1088.jpg"><img class="alignnone size-medium wp-image-2802" title="DSC_1088" src="http://blog.lesterpickerphoto.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/06/DSC_1088-300x200.jpg" alt="" width="300" height="200"></a></p>

<p>Me Foto makes three variants of its uber-portable tripods. I chose the heaviest of the lot- the Globetrotter- because I am a bug for stability.  Even so the MeFoto is not designed to be in the same league with the Gitzo 3541, but as you’ll see I found it exceptionally versatile, easy to carry, and made of quality materials that continually amazed me.</p>

<p> </p>

<h3>What’s Included</h3>


<p> </p>

<p>The MeFoto comes with rubber tips and a rugged carry case that includes a concealed zipper pouch, and an adjustable carry strap. In that pouch the company includes a set of metal spikes for use in sand, an Allen wrench, and an instruction booklet. Also included is a bracket to attach to your camera so it fits the Arca-Swiss ballhead attachment on the tripod. All of my Really Right Stuff brackets fit the MeFoto ballhead perfectly. There is also a spring-loaded hook at the bottom of the center column so that you can add mass when the wind is blowing. In fact I used that hook throughout my trip due to bad weather in Europe in May, 2013. I attached a carabineer to my bag and clipped it to the hook in less than a second. The tripod also includes a rubberized upper leg column on one of the legs, making carrying it a breeze.</p>

<p><a href="http://blog.lesterpickerphoto.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/06/DSC_1093.jpg"><img class="alignnone size-medium wp-image-2803" title="DSC_1093" src="http://blog.lesterpickerphoto.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/06/DSC_1093-300x200.jpg" alt="" width="300" height="200"></a></p>

<p>One ingenious feature of the MeFoto is that one of the legs (the one with the rubberized section) unscrews from the tripod and attaches to the removable center column to create a monopod! It’s like getting two critical pieces of equipment in one.</p>

<p>The machining tolerances on the tripod mechanisms are excellent, in my non-engineering opinion. Legs extend and collapse smoothly with just a quarter-turn of the knurled, rubberized twist locks. The head clamps easily and it firmly held my Nikon D800 with 70-200 f2.8 lens and 1.4 extender. The pan adjustment moves smoothly.</p>

<p> </p>

<p><a href="http://blog.lesterpickerphoto.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/06/DSC_1099.jpg"><img class="alignnone size-medium wp-image-2804" title="DSC_1099" src="http://blog.lesterpickerphoto.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/06/DSC_1099-300x200.jpg" alt="" width="300" height="200"></a></p>

<p> </p>

<h3>Field Test</h3>


<p> </p>

<p>I am a bug for field-testing equipment under real-world conditions. In this respect the MeFoto exceeded my expectations.</p>

<p> </p>

<p>It is so light to carry compared to my usual setup, I found myself smiling most of the time. Setup was quick and easy. The tripod is so small you won’t find yourself ramming it into people on crowded, narrow European streets.</p>

<p> </p>

<p>My only reservation is the price. My larger unit costs $369. However, I would happily pay that again, given how functional it proved to be on my trip. Of course, I would not choose to take it along on my wildlife or landscape adventures, but this wonderful piece of equipment has won a favored place in my photo gear.</p>

<p> </p>

<p>If you have any further questions about the tripod, feel free to ask.</p>

		  <div class="entry-content"><p>I have owned an <a href="http://www.thinktankphoto.com/products/urban-disguise-50-v2.aspx">Urban Disguise 50 (Version 2.0)</a> camera bag for two years now and have never done a review of it. Frankly, I own far too many camera bags, particularly from <a href="http://www.thinktankphoto.com/">Think Tank</a> Photo, so much so that I’m afraid my camera friends will begin to call me Imelda. But as I’ve gotten older I find that the right bag can prevent many of the aches and pains that we older photographers are prone to get.</p>

<p>Those who follow my reviews know that I do not cover the technical details such as measurements, materials and speed ratings, unless those items directly pertain to how the item works in the field. Those stats are commonly available online at lab review sites or at the manufacturer’s site. What I do is review items I buy and use as a pro out in the field.</p>

<p>The UD 50 is a terrific bag for its intended use, which is to carry photo equipment around with you while touring in a city or town. It is not intended for landscape or wildlife photographers and, as I’ll explain later, for extended use even in cities, at least in my opinion.</p>

<p>The bag is extremely rugged and, as with all Think Tank products, very thoughtfully designed for serious amateurs and pros. At $199.75 it cost more than most bags because of those characteristics. Every stitch is durable. An abundance of pockets makes organization a cinch.</p>

<p>The provided over-the-shoulder strap is padded and quite comfortable. An optional shoulder harness is available, but please see my comments below before purchasing it.</p>

<p>The bag has plenty of room for a 15” laptop and a couple of file folders. I use a MacBook Air and it slips in and out with ease. It also has a zip-open expander, which I frankly find less than useful because it makes the bag a bit lopsided.</p>

<p>The bag is perfect for using for flying, especially on foreign carriers like RyanAir, which are quite strict regarding measurements and weight. The bag complies with most carry-on restrictions in terms of size. The weight limitation is a practical one. It would be difficult to carry more than 10 Kg (22 pounds) and still be able to get around comfortably. The bag also has a zippered pocket in the back that allows it to mount easily on the handle of your luggage. When you&#8217;re done, zip the bottom and you have another handy pocket to drop in your boarding passes as you trudge through the airport.</p>

<p>Other pluses include the thoughtful little things that Think Tank does. One is that the zippers work wonderfully and have a large hole drilled into the tabs so that the bag can be locked with a small lock. I carry another wire lock in one of the side pockets of the bag that allows me to attach to the bag&#8217;s zippers and the other side to an airport bench, hotel room bathtub bar, or restaurant table.  Another plus are the two smaller expandable side pockets which hold a small water bottle or sundry accessory items that we photographers collect.</p>

<p> </p>

<h3>How I use it</h3>


<p>Here is a photo of the gear I packed in the UD50 to take with me for a one-month photo tour of Italy, Sicily and Malta.</p>

<p><a href="http://blog.lesterpickerphoto.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/06/photo.jpg"><img class="size-medium wp-image-2794" title="photo" src="http://blog.lesterpickerphoto.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/06/photo-300x225.jpg" alt="" width="300" height="225"></a></p>

<p>For the record, the gear includes a Nikon D800 with attached Nikkor 24-70 f2.8, Nikkor 70-200 f2.8, Nikkor 24mm tilt-shift, Nikkor 1.4 tele-extender, Hoodman loupe, 5 Lee/Singh-Ray 4x6 filters in case, Lee large filter holder, batteries, and paraphernalia.</p>

<p>In addition, I carried my 15” MacBook Air in the purpose-built laptop compartment, along with its charger. I also devised a rig that allowed me to securely tie my 4-pound (1.8kg) travel tripod (see upcoming review on that) to the top of the bag.</p>

<p>In this front pouch I carry lots of travel accessories, including pens, my stash of teas, business cards, earbuds, etc.</p>

<p><a href="http://blog.lesterpickerphoto.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/06/photo-copy.jpg"><img class="alignnone size-medium wp-image-2795" title="photo copy" src="http://blog.lesterpickerphoto.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/06/photo-copy-300x225.jpg" alt="" width="300" height="225"></a></p>

<p> </p>

<p>I’m not sure whether the bag fools anyone into thinking this is not chock full of camera equipment (as in &#8220;Urban Disguise&#8221;), but the bag does well with one body and 2-3 lenses, filters and accessories.</p>

<h3>The Cons</h3>


<p>My biggest issue with the UD50 is that when fully loaded it is heavy and causes major neck pain for me if carried for prolonged periods of time. In fairness, I am over 60 and for a younger photographer that may not pose a problem.</p>

<p>You can purchase an optional backpack harness that allows you to carry it on your shoulders as a hiking backpack. I did this for the entire month, as I hiked through cities, towns, villages and farmlands. All I can say is that while it is somewhat of an improvement over the shoulder strap, by the end of the first day my shoulders and neck were killing me and continued to do so for the duration of the trip. The harness is only meant for short-distance use. It does not fall on the hips for support, as a true backpack should. It also does not allow for the many useful adjustments that allow a pack to stay high and close to your body. Still, I would recommend the harness if you have no choice but to use the UD50 for lengthy city shoots.</p>

<p> </p>

<h3>Conclusion</h3>


<p>Despite its limitations, I like the UD50 and will continue to use it for weekend trips to cities or special assignments. I will soon be reviewing Mindshift’s newest bag, the Rotation 180. Now THAT is a bag you can hike with all day, every day! Mindshift is a spinoff of ThinkTank.</p>

		  <div class="entry-content"><p>If you are a photographer who has not visited Malta, book that trip now. If you do not have Malta on your bucket list, add it now.  I’ve just wound up a 5-day trip to this wonderful, exciting and visually dynamic island nation and I am already planning a second, more extensive two- or three-week return visit.</p>

<h3> Some Background</h3>


<p>The three main islands that constitute Malta are the island of Malta itself and the adjoining Gozo and the tiny Comino, situated between the two. Malta has perhaps the most fascinating history of any place I have ever visited, having been variously invaded and populated by Phoenicians, Greeks, Romans, Normans, Arabs, and finally Roman Catholics. In fact, the island today is heavily Roman Catholic and the influence of the church is evident everywhere. Gozo alone, an island you can drive completely around in a couple of hours, has more than 50 churches, some dating back to the 15<sup style="line-height: 19px;">th</sup> century. Malta itself has so many churches, basilicas, monasteries and convents, you’d be hard pressed to visit them all in a year.</p>

<p> </p>

<h3>Photography Options</h3>


<p>The photographic options in Malta are nearly endless, except for non-bird wildlife photography, as Malta has no large indigenous mammals. First are the historic structures. Did you know that the largest freestanding temples in the world are on Malta? Some 5,600 years old, the Ggantija temples are a marvel of pagan construction. To this day we know little about these early inhabitants. Ditto for the other main prehistoric temple complex, Hagar Qim. Unfortunately, photography options at these temples is severely reduced due to ongoing archaeological digs, scaffolding to shore up crumbling infrastructure, and tents covering the site at Hagar Qim to minimize environmental damage. </p>

<p>Next up are the ancient Phoenician, Greek, Roman, Norman and early Christian buildings that are in various states of repair, preservation and restoration. These sites will be Valhalla for architectural photographers. The same holds true for those who are into capturing images of historic churches. If you are into religious photography, don’t expect to spend a week here and feel good about leaving. Every church, convent, monastery and basilica is special, with a unique history attached to it.</p>

<p>Then there are the historical structures that are attached to religious causes, but are not in themselves churches. The most famous of these is the Sacra Infermeria, built in 1574 by the Knights of St. John, with a history of treating the wounded in battle, the sick and infirm for centuries. The Order even received dispensation from the Pope to allow them to perform autopsies in order to advance their medical knowledge, ostensibly to aid Christian pilgrims.</p>

<p><a href="http://blog.lesterpickerphoto.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/05/DSC_0594-Panorama.jpg"><img class="size-medium wp-image-2786" title="DSC_0594 Panorama" src="http://blog.lesterpickerphoto.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/05/DSC_0594-Panorama-300x175.jpg" alt="" width="300" height="175"></a></p>

<p> </p>

<p>Each village in Malta is a photographer’s dream. Unlike in Sicily, the people in Malta are more receptive to being photographed. These tiny villages still live a wholesome way of life and the combination of architecture, people and lifestyle make for a potent photographic stew.</p>

<p>What I am looking forward to in my next visit is capturing the stark landscapes that constitute the Maltese interior. Stone walls dating back to Roman times crisscross the land, often as farmed terraces cultivated in small plots. On these terraces you will find everything from vineyards to fruits and vegetables. Interestingly, these farmed plots go right up to the edge of major cities like Valetta.</p>

<p> </p>

<h3>Waterscapes and Cityscapes</h3>


<p>Since Malta is an island, waterscapes abound along its rocky coast and bays. There are picturesque bays and grottos, as well as sand beaches, although they are not the lush tropical variety, nor are they the forested shores we see in colder climes.</p>

<p>The Maltese cities are treasure troves of potential images, each with its unique character. Mdina is a medieval city perched atop a hill that still has 200 residents living there. Cars are prohibited, except for those of residents, making the touring experience free of hassles and full of narrow streets and ancient buildings.</p>

<p><a href="http://blog.lesterpickerphoto.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/05/DSC_0629.jpg"><img class="size-medium wp-image-2787" title="DSC_0629" src="http://blog.lesterpickerphoto.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/05/DSC_0629-200x300.jpg" alt="" width="200" height="300"></a></p>

<p> </p>

<p>Valetta, on the other hand, is a large city (at least in terms of Malta) and a mix of modern and ancient. The government is now executing major renovations of the historic fort walls, dating back to the 15<sup>th</sup> century.</p>

<p>If it is maritime heritage and folksy shots of working fishing boats and salty characters, you can’t go wrong spending a morning in Martsaxlokk fishing village, where colorful boats bob up and down in the quaint harbor. Unfortunately, a major power plant on the shoreline has ruined one sight line, but there are plenty of other ways to capture the beauty of this picturesque harbor town.</p>

<p> </p>

<h3>Easy Travel</h3>


<p>Another thing that makes Malta so inviting is that nearly everyone speaks English, plus another language, in addition to their native Maltese which is spoken nowhere else on Earth. They are also universally friendly.</p>

<p>Lodging is plentiful, ranging from B&amp;Bs to luxury hotels. The Maltese public bus system is terrific (modern and cheap), run by a private company with service throughout the island on a regular, published schedule. Driving is not advised, unless you’re used to driving on the left side. Main roads are good, but rural side roads are largely unpaved or poorly maintained. Most town and city streets are perilously narrow.</p>

<p>Boat trips, tours and private charters are available in nearly every seaside town. The weather during my stay was not cooperative for three of the days, so I could not take advantage of the boat options.</p>

<p>Restaurants are plentiful and many of them are reportedly excellent. The ones I experienced were good to very good.</p>

<p>I do plan to return to Malta, this time with a list of “must captures” and a whole lot more days. I suggest you check it out for a potential photography bucket listing. I guarantee you will not regret it.</p>

		  <div class="entry-content"><p>This is a photography blog, and today I’m going to address a critical concern for all photographers visiting Italy- driving.  That’s right. It’s one thing to know your camera, but what good is that if you don’t arrive alive? So, if you want to live to photograph in Italy, you might want to read this.</p>

<p>I’ve just spent over two weeks driving in Italy, along its Autostradas as well as along its winding, narrow streets, in large, grand cities like Florence, as well as tiny towns so small their names did not appear on my GPS system. I’m no expert, but then again that’s the point. If you’re not an expert and just want to drive in Italy, you need to know these things. I wish someone had told me these before I rented a car.</p>

<p>First some observations. Not all Italian drivers are nuts, at least not more than Boston drivers would be if streets in Beantown were far narrower and laid out even zanier than they are now. But in the spirit of cars-don’t-kill-people, people-kill-people stupid sayings, it is about that minority of Italian drivers who might kill you that I will focus on.</p>

<p><strong style="font-size: 13px; line-height: 19px;">Mario Andretti</strong>. To Italians driving is like eating, something to be savored, a passion. They don’t just drive, they are consumed by it. When they get behind the wheel, they are Mario Andretti reincarnated. Accept it for what it is.</p>

<p><strong style="font-size: 13px; line-height: 19px;">Speed limits?</strong> Fuggedaboudit! I’m sure you have heard about this before, but when you drive on the Autostrada where posted speeds are 110-130 km/h (68-81 mph), Italian drivers view that as mere suggestions. I often drove at 130 and was passed by drivers doing a minimum of 175! Get used to it.</p>

<p><strong style="font-size: 13px; line-height: 19px;">Tailgating</strong>. Italian drivers give new meaning to the word tailgating. I would be driving at 130 kph, then merge left to pass a slower moving car, and before I could even get back into the right lane, a car would appear out of nowhere and be 6 inches off my bumper! Okay, that’s a bit of an exaggeration. Actually they were 6 millimeters away. Seriously.</p>

<p>That’s not the worst of it. When they merge back to the right, they literally cut you off. I often had cars missing my front fender by so little, I was afraid they had neatly shaved the paint off.</p>

<p><strong style="font-size: 13px; line-height: 19px;">Lines</strong>. There is no such thing as an orderly line of cars in Italy. People do not alternate when merging. Often a car will rush at your car door at a merge, then come to a stop inches away and allow you to go first. Other times they will rush at your car door then swerve around you without stopping. We asked a man in Trapani, Sicily where to line up to board the ferry and he laughingly replied: “In Sicily there are no lines!” True to form, cars came from everywhere to board the ferry. It was complete chaos for ten minutes and then, somehow, it all straightened itself out.</p>

<p><strong style="font-size: 13px; line-height: 19px;">The Pluses</strong>. On the plus side, the Autostradas are a pleasure to drive; well-paved, modern and convenient. In more than two weeks of driving I never once saw a police presence on Autostradas. Toll booths are mostly automatic and you pay with cash or credit card, although none of the directions are in English and sometimes their Internet was down so you had to deal with a toll taker. Rest areas are well spaced and, interestingly, offer wine and beer. Best of all, Italians drive on the same side of the road as we do in North America. </p>

<p> </p>

<h3>Suggestions</h3>


<p>Here are some suggestions for driving in Italy:</p>

<p><strong style="font-size: 13px; line-height: 19px;">Reserve an Automatic</strong>. Reserve an automatic car in advance if you possibly can. Dealing with the traffic in cities (more on that later) is difficult enough, but doing so while shifting gears is taxing, to say the least. I rented a 6-gear Alfa Romeo, which was a terrific car, but I stalled twice in city traffic while drivers gave me imaginative lessons in how best to use one’s middle finger.</p>

<p><strong style="font-size: 13px; line-height: 19px;">Bring Anti-Anxiety meds</strong>. Don’t ask, just get a scrip from your doctor just in case. Why? Well, let’s say that you’re stupid enough to drive the Amalfi coast (alright, at least I won’t do it again!), a drive that has sometimes been understatedly described as harrowing, you will drive along a winding, hair-pin curved, single-lane road that for some strange reason has two-way traffic on it (go figure). Tour bus after tour bus comes at you at twice the posted speed- I mean suggested speed- and misses your side view mirror by two inches. Ooops, another exaggeration, 2 millimeters. Where’s that bottle of meds when you need it? Here is a <a href="http://youtu.be/v5OM9oOaeTA">short video</a> that my wife recorded as we drove the Amalfi coast. </p>

<p><strong style="font-size: 13px; line-height: 19px;">Tunnelphobia</strong>? If you have a fear of tunnels, do not drive in Sicily from Messina to Cefalu. That drive takes you through literally dozens and dozens of tunnels. On at least ten 5-km stretches of road, you are in tunnels more than 60% of the time, in some cases 75%. Some of the tunnels are old and narrow, so be forewarned. Most of the older tunnels are being replaced and the modern ones are terrific, with wide lanes and a breakdown lane and turn-outs to get your vehicle off-road in case of a mishap.</p>

<p><strong>Ferries</strong>. Many of Italy’s ferries are one-way load-unload boats. That means that you will either have to back in your car at the point of departure or back it out at the arrival port. Be prepared for that eventuality.</p>

<p><strong>Parking</strong>. You’re kidding, right? Good luck!</p>

<p><strong>City driving</strong>. Don’t if you can avoid it. Park outside the city and take a bus, shuttle or train into town. In many cities, like Florence (called Firenze by Italians), you can get a huge fine for driving into the city center. Streets are incredibly narrow, having been built for foot traffic or horse-drawn wagons (we’re talking Roman wagons!) 2,000 years ago.  Cars are parked and double-parked all over the streets making negotiating city traffic a torment. I was only able to do it because I grew up in Brooklyn (ha, ha!).</p>

<p><a href="http://blog.lesterpickerphoto.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/05/DSC_8945.jpg"><img class="size-medium wp-image-2779" title="DSC_8945" src="http://blog.lesterpickerphoto.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/05/DSC_8945-200x300.jpg" alt="" width="200" height="300"></a></p>

<p><strong>Cycles</strong>. You have to get used to motorcycles and bicycles in Italy. I mean a lot of them, as in a whole big bunch, bigger than a bizzilion. The trouble is that motorcycles obey no rules of the road that my wife and I could discern. They will pass you on the right or left. They will weave in and out in city traffic. They park in the road, on sidewalks, behind your rear bumper, even in apartment hallways.</p>

<p><strong>No Lanes</strong>. Forget the middle lane that separates drivers going in opposite directions. Italian drivers see that as a rubber line that can be bent to one’s will when passing. It’s up to you to stay alert for the frequent drivers that pass on curves as you are coming from the opposite direction.</p>

<p><strong>Signage</strong>. Italy has far fewer road signs than do we in North America. Street signs in cities are far and few between. You will be told to turn on a certain street, but there is not a sign to be seen. We navigated pretty well by using a GPS (buy the Italian map upgrade before you go) and a Michelin map, but we also got lost periodically. However, we always view those times as an adventure. Some of my favorite images have come from those “alternate” routes.</p>

<p>The truth is that some people will love driving in Italy (that would be me) and some will be traumatized by it (that would be my wife, but part of that is possibly- remote as it is-  my inattentive driving) . One couple my wife knows rented a car and then simply left it right in the middle of the first city they traveled through. While public transportation is widely available, we photographers want the flexibility to stop whenever the light and scenery are right. All I’m saying is be forewarned. Teasing aside, I found Italian drivers to be mostly considerate, although their pattern of driving is different from ours.</p>

<p>Have you have had a “driving in Italy” experience or a driving tip? Share it here, but please keep the language clean. </p>

		  <div class="entry-content"><p>If you’re photo travel plans include Sicily, you will not want to miss the small, medieval town of Erice. Situated on a mountaintop near Trapani, on the southern coast, Erice is reached by car, private and public bus, or cable car.</p>

<p><a href="http://blog.lesterpickerphoto.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/05/DSC_9824-2.jpg"><img class="alignnone size-medium wp-image-2769" title="DSC_9824-2" src="http://blog.lesterpickerphoto.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/05/DSC_9824-2-200x300.jpg" alt="" width="200" height="300"></a></p>

<p>This little town in a jewel for photographers. Every street, every corner you turn, offers exciting opportunities for photography, from architectural to travel to people.</p>

<p><a href="http://blog.lesterpickerphoto.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/05/DSC_9844-2.jpg"><img class="alignnone size-medium wp-image-2770" title="DSC_9844-2" src="http://blog.lesterpickerphoto.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/05/DSC_9844-2-300x200.jpg" alt="" width="300" height="200"></a></p>

<p>The town shelters myriad churches and monasteries, but there is also a castle, stone-paved streets, houses and small boutique hotels.</p>

<p><a href="http://blog.lesterpickerphoto.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/05/DSC_9879-2-Panorama-2.jpg"><img class="alignnone size-medium wp-image-2771" title="DSC_9879-2 Panorama-2" src="http://blog.lesterpickerphoto.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/05/DSC_9879-2-Panorama-2-243x300.jpg" alt="" width="243" height="300"></a></p>

<p> </p>

<p>One of my favorite things about travel photography is the opportunity to meet wonderful people, living different lives than mine, but still enjoying a quality of life that works for them. Whether children, adults or the elderly, I love peoples faces and their life experiences etched-or not etched, in the case of children- into the lines of their faces.</p>

<p><a href="http://blog.lesterpickerphoto.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/05/DSC_9923-2.jpg"><img class="size-medium wp-image-2772" title="DSC_9923-2" src="http://blog.lesterpickerphoto.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/05/DSC_9923-2-200x300.jpg" alt="" width="200" height="300"></a></p>

<p> </p>

<p>That is how I met a new friend, Francesco Bondi, otherwise known as Barbablu.  This wonderful man creates and sells toys he makes himself. His life motto is: “Resistere E’ Creare; Creare E’ Resistere”- “To resist is to create, to create is to resist.” How can you not instantly like a man who lives like that?</p>

<p>After seeing his infectious enthusiasm for his toys, for life really, out in the narrow street, I asked if I could photograph him (you must do that in Sicily in particular).  I did so for a few minutes and when I showed him the results, he hugged and kissed me in the street, laughing all the time. My wife and I spent the next fifteen minutes or so talking with him in his spare English and our non-existent Italian. It always amazes me how people can connect across cultures with nothing more than smiles, hugs, gestures and a willing heart.</p>

<p><a href="http://blog.lesterpickerphoto.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/05/DSC_9905-2.jpg"><img class="size-medium wp-image-2773" title="DSC_9905-2" src="http://blog.lesterpickerphoto.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/05/DSC_9905-2-200x300.jpg" alt="" width="200" height="300"></a></p>

<p> </p>

<p>Of course, I sent Barbablu’s image to his companion by Internet that evening. I will also mail him a photograph that I will print myself as soon as I get home. I feel that is our obligation as travel photographers.</p>

		  <div class="entry-content"><p>Off the coast of Trapani, Sicily, right at the point of the boot, sit the three tiny Egadi Islands. The largest is Favignana and I’m here right now photographing. I thought I’d share with you today’s adventure as an illustration of creative choice in photography.</p>

<p>Atop the highest point of the island there is an old fortress, which some locals prefer to call a castle.  My guess is that those who call it a castle have never done the strenuous hike up there.</p>

<p> </p>

<p><a href="http://blog.lesterpickerphoto.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/05/DSC_9395.jpg"><img class="size-medium wp-image-2761" title="DSC_9395" src="http://blog.lesterpickerphoto.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/05/DSC_9395-300x200.jpg" alt="" width="300" height="200"></a></p>

<p>The fortress sits about 1,000 feet above the historic town (in Europe everything is historic, at least by American standards). We climbed it today and spent a glorious couple of hours exploring the land immediately around it and then poking through the abandoned ruins.</p>

<p>As a landscape, travel and wildlife photographer, the overwhelming majority of my work is in color. But, once inside the fortress, which is a shambles, it was obvious to me that I wanted to interpret the scenes in black &amp; white. To me it had a “feel” of grittiness and abandonment that was best expressed in B&amp;W. I’m sure that another photographer would interpret the scenes beautifully in color, and that is one of the many things I just love about photography.</p>

<p><a href="http://blog.lesterpickerphoto.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/05/DSC_9452-Edit.jpg"><img class="alignnone size-medium wp-image-2762" title="DSC_9452-Edit" src="http://blog.lesterpickerphoto.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/05/DSC_9452-Edit-200x300.jpg" alt="" width="200" height="300"></a></p>

<p>In any case, here are a few images from that visit, quickly done this evening as I recovered from the hike.</p>

<p><a href="http://blog.lesterpickerphoto.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/05/DSC_9453-Edit.jpg"><img class="alignnone size-medium wp-image-2763" title="DSC_9453-Edit" src="http://blog.lesterpickerphoto.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/05/DSC_9453-Edit-300x200.jpg" alt="" width="300" height="200"></a></p>

<p>The technical information is that all the images from today’s shoot were imported into Lightroom 4. I then selected several potentials for export into Nik software’s Silver Efex Pro, a wonderful, easy-to-use program. A few fast adjustments and here you are.</p>

<p><a href="http://blog.lesterpickerphoto.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/05/DSC_9470-Edit.jpg"><img class="alignnone size-medium wp-image-2764" title="DSC_9470-Edit" src="http://blog.lesterpickerphoto.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/05/DSC_9470-Edit-200x300.jpg" alt="" width="200" height="300"></a></p>

<p>Of course, when I get home I’ll post-process the original images first, then do whatever I need in Lightroom, PhotoShop or Silver Efex and hopefully improve on the results.</p>

		  <div class="entry-content"><p>This was my first visit to Pompei and every preconception I had of the site was dashed within minutes. I had a schedule to keep and I alloted two hours to visiting Pompei. Instead, we ended up spending five very active hours and when the park closed we were one of the last to leave. I could easily have spent another day or two exploring these ancient ruins- and in fact I expect I will because my photography was rushed and I was not allowed to bring in my tripod without permission, which I will try to get next time in advance.</p>

<p>All I can say is that every superlative pales in comparison to the actual experience of being there. To think that 20,000 people lived, worked and played there and then were wiped out within a day is nearly impossible to grok. To be honest, if I had to pick a time and place to have lived other than now, it Pompeii goes to the top of my list. Of course I&#8217;d rather not have it be in 79 A.D. when Mt. Vesuvius blew mightily, sending ash more than 20,000 feet high. I&#8217;d also like to have been one of the lucky wealthy few, who lived in luxury beyond imagining.</p>

<p>I had just arrived and was exploring another area of the park, when I turned around and saw an incredible sight. A cloud formation had formed over Mt. Vesuvius. I quickly took some images.</p>

<p><a href="http://blog.lesterpickerphoto.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/05/owls.jpg"><img class="alignnone size-medium wp-image-2752" title="owls" src="http://blog.lesterpickerphoto.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/05/owls-300x200.jpg" alt="" width="300" height="200"></a></p>

<p>However, when I ran to a spot closer to the mountain for a few snaps, the cloud had already passed and the effect lost. But I coud not help but wonder how the people felt when the eruption occurred in an ear-piercing blast and the rain of ash suffocated them. It gave me the chills.</p>

<p>The Pompeii preserve is huge. If you end up going, I strongly suggest you allot 2-3 days to tour it thoroughly. Make sure to rent the audio tour. We bought the tour book, but there was never enough time to find the correct place in the book and then read it. Fortunately, we met a man who worked there and he filled in many of the blanks.</p>

<p>One exhibit particularly affected me, and that was a display of the casts of several of the victims. The residents of Pompei died so quickly from suffocation in over ten feet of hot ash, they and their animals were literally frozen in place. I noted a German tourist who stood by one of the cases holding a casualty and I was struck by his emotional reaction.</p>

<p><a href="http://blog.lesterpickerphoto.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/05/owls-22.jpg"><img class="alignnone size-medium wp-image-2756" title="owls-2" src="http://blog.lesterpickerphoto.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/05/owls-22-300x200.jpg" alt="" width="300" height="200"></a></p>

<p> </p>

<p>The overwhelming impression one gets is that Pompei was an incredible place to live, at least if you had even moderate wealth. The artwork and artisan craftwork is sublime. The mosaics are awesome. One piece showing Alexander battling Darius is composed of over two million tiny tiles.  The buildings and homes are architectural marvels. If your plans include a visit to Italy, I&#8217;d advise you to be sure that you get to Pompei&#8230; for at least two days.</p>

		  <div class="entry-content"><p>Well, we arrived in Rome in the rain, got in a rental car and hightailed it out of town to a marvelous B&amp;B (more on that in a minute). We had taken a red-eye from Baltimore to London and I could not get more than a hour of very disturbed sleep (how can anyone sleep in Economy Plus, let alone Economy!?). Then our next flight to Rome was delayed, so by the time I arrived I was bleary-eyed and bushed. Knowing this would be a possibility, I had booked our first night at a B&amp;B in Civitella San Paolo, about an hour out of Rome. Turns out that was a smart decision.</p>

<p>Our hosts at Le Tre Querce B&amp;B, Louisa and Riccardo, were simply awesome. One look at us and Louisa insisted on making us dinner.In 30 minutes she put on the table a dinner better than many an Italian restaurant in the States. Firm spaghetti with a delicate sauce (homemade, of course), fresh salad, hearty bread, black olives from their property, and the absolute best Romano-Parmesan cheese my wife and I have ever tasted. It was creamy, not crumbly, and oh so flavorful. The meal was topped with a bowl of fresh cut strawberries. And red wine, naturally. Bellisimo!!</p>

<p><a href="http://blog.lesterpickerphoto.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/05/photo-copy.jpg"><img class="size-medium wp-image-2742" title="photo copy" src="http://blog.lesterpickerphoto.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/05/photo-copy-300x225.jpg" alt="" width="300" height="225"></a></p>

<p>After a relaxing night in an immaculately clean room, and a hot shower, we were ready to tackle our drive to Siena for my first photo shoot. But first, a hearty breakfast, courtesy of Louisa&#8217;s kitchen. Now I was ready for a nap, but instead we headed for the road, saying arrivederci to Louisa and Riccardo. We could not have hoped to stay in a warmer, more home-like, friendly place.</p>

<p><a href="http://blog.lesterpickerphoto.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/05/louisa-riccardo-le-querce-.jpg"><img class="size-medium wp-image-2743" title="louisa-riccardo-le-querce-" src="http://blog.lesterpickerphoto.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/05/louisa-riccardo-le-querce--300x200.jpg" alt="" width="300" height="200"></a></p>

<p>Just a quick aside about Italian drivers. They are not near so crazy as a lot of people say. Yes, they do ride your tail when you&#8217;re doing 120 kph. But they don&#8217;t beep or act rude. They sit there patiently, literally 12 inches from your rear bumper, giving you fits, until you pull over, which in my case took about 1.3 seconds every time it happened. They also drive down one lane cobblestone streets that amazingly have two-way traffic at insane speeds. Okay, &#8216;nuf said (for now).</p>

<p>Here&#8217;s a quick shot of the Duomo in Siena, in one of the rare non-rainy moments we had on our first few days. The architecture, of course mostly church related, is breathtaking.</p>

<p><a href="http://blog.lesterpickerphoto.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/05/duopmo-siena-2013.jpg"><img class="alignnone size-medium wp-image-2744" title="duopmo-siena-2013" src="http://blog.lesterpickerphoto.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/05/duopmo-siena-2013-300x200.jpg" alt="" width="300" height="200"></a></p>

<p>More on Siena and Florence later in the week. Still trying to catch up with the sleep deprivation.</p>

		  <div class="entry-content"><p>In celebration of spring, I&#8217;m sharing with my blog readers some tips from my e-book series: <a href="http://shop.lesterpickerphoto.com/"><em><strong>The Photographer&#8217;s Eye</strong></em></a>. There are three books on shooting landscapes, wildlife and people. Each book includes ten images that serve as examples of various techniques  along with extensive shooting information. Each book ends with ten tips to make your shooting more effective.</p>

<p>If you’re shooting landscapes, one of the most effective means of adding interest and impact is to include a foreground element. A strong foreground helps bring scale and perspective to a scene. It can functionally help by drawing the viewer’s eye into a scene. It can create visual interest by adding texture, an interesting form, or a looming presence. It can even add cognitive dissonance by forcing the viewer to confront paradoxes in perception.</p>

<p><a href="http://blog.lesterpickerphoto.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/05/CanadianRockies2009-driftwood-in-lake-1-2.jpg"><img class="size-medium wp-image-2737" title="Impending Storm" src="http://blog.lesterpickerphoto.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/05/CanadianRockies2009-driftwood-in-lake-1-2-300x199.jpg" alt="" width="300" height="199"></a></p>

<p>How do you use foreground elements judiciously? First try putting them off center for visual interest, perhaps at the very edge of the frame. Next decide how much of the foreground-to-background you want in focus. I often use a special lens, called a tilt-shift lens, to give my images more depth-of-field, but if you have a tripod you can just move your aperture to f16 or even f22 to get maximum depth of field without hand shake. I nearly always use a tripod to keep foreground and background in sharp focus.</p>

<p>Want more advice on foregrounds? Check out this link to another of my blogs: <a href="http://blog.lesterpickerphoto.com/2011/03/08/foreground-is-forewarned/">http://blog.lesterpickerphoto.com/2011/03/08/foreground-is-forewarned/</a></p>

<p> </p>

<p>Happy shooting!</p>

		  <div class="entry-content"><p>My next post will be from Italy, as I&#8217;m frantically cleaning equipment and going through my pre-assignment checklist of things to bring. I haven&#8217;t been to Italy in more than a decade, and even then it was only for a short stop in Rome. This trip I&#8217;ll be driving at the height of spring between Florence and Sicily, then flying the historic Ionian Sea to Malta, and then back to Italy for a few solid days photographing in Rome itself. Can&#8217;t wait!</p>

<p><a href="http://blog.lesterpickerphoto.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/05/italy-400.jpg"><img class="alignnone size-medium wp-image-2733" title="italy 400" src="http://blog.lesterpickerphoto.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/05/italy-400-262x300.jpg" alt="" width="262" height="300"></a></p>

<p>On the drive down south from Florence, I&#8217;m hoping to capture some images of the Amalfi coast, even though I abhor driving on crowded, winding, narrow roads with no guardrails and sheer drop-offs. If I chicken out (I&#8217;d give that around 90% certainty), I&#8217;ll hire a driver for that segment of my trip. It&#8217;s funny in that I don&#8217;t mind hiking narrow trails at altitude, but driving without guardrails and with steep drop-offs has always scared the daylights out of me.</p>

<p>I&#8217;ll be posting regularly here and on Facebook and Twitter, so please stay tuned. And, if you have any favorite Italy/Malta photo opps in mind, please share them here.</p>

		  <div class="entry-content"><p>Here&#8217;s another photo tip from my eBook <a href="http://shop.lesterpickerphoto.com/">Photographing People</a> in my <em><strong>The Photographer&#8217;s Eye</strong></em> series. I call it: <strong>Get a Picture, Give a Print</strong>.</p>

<p>This is always a fun thing to do, if you intend to visit a location again, OR if you use one of the tiny new portable printers now on the market.</p>

<p><a href="http://blog.lesterpickerphoto.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/04/2006-11-ecuador17461.jpg"><img class="size-medium wp-image-2729" title="Winning Smile" src="http://blog.lesterpickerphoto.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/04/2006-11-ecuador17461-200x300.jpg" alt="" width="200" height="300"></a></p>

<p> </p>

<p>Once you get a subject to agree to allow you to take their picture- and often I end up making some great friends that way- I either send a print to that person once I get home or else bring one with me on my next visit to the country. In Ecuador, there is a market in Otavalo where I love to spend time photographing. When I go back, I bring prints of my subjects from my last visit and now the people are excited when I return. They even have my prints hanging on their walls.</p>

<p>This is a great way to make friends, influence people, and make the job easier for you on subsequent visits or for fellow photographers. I personally do not tip people for taking their photos, but I do show my gratitude by sending them something that I consider even more valuable. That respect goes a long way.</p>

		  <div class="entry-content"><p>In giving you some photo tips from my e-books over the past two weeks, I had a regular visitor write to me asking about tripods. The question was mostly about which tripod would be best for his circumstances, but the conversation reminded me that I&#8217;d better slip in one of my most talked about tips and one that I revisit pretty regularly. Stated simply, if you want the Number One secret to improving your landscape images it is to simply use a tripod. Every pro landscape photographer I know uses one at least 90% of the time. To understand more of the reasons a tripod can help, <a href="http://blog.lesterpickerphoto.com/2010/12/15/tripod-or-lens/">click on a blog</a> I did a while back explaining why I use one about 90% of the time for landscapes.</p>

<p>In my case I use a big ole Gitzo 3541 with a Really Right Stuff BH-55 ballhead. It&#8217;s a monster to carry around, weighing in at 8 pounds, even though the tripod is carbon fiber. Add that to my other gear and I&#8217;m packing between 30 and 40 pounds when I hike into a pristine location to photograph. At my age that&#8217;s equivalent to maybe 200 pounds, especially on the way back to the car. So, it better be worth the effort. The plain fact is that it is.</p>

<p><a href="http://blog.lesterpickerphoto.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/04/LAP3024.jpg"><img class="size-medium wp-image-2726" title="_LAP3024" src="http://blog.lesterpickerphoto.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/04/LAP3024-300x199.jpg" alt="" width="300" height="199"></a></p>

<p>On my upcoming trip to Italy and Malta, which I&#8217;ll be blogging about starting next week, I did something I never thought I&#8217;d do. I bought a lightweight travel tripod. I can&#8217;t wait for it to arrive so I can test it out. Naturally, I&#8217;ll do a review of it once I put it through it&#8217;s paces in Italy. The thing weighs 4 pounds, including ballhead, so I&#8217;m not getting my hopes up just yet. Still, by my calculation, the tripod will be beneficial when I need to use slow shutter speeds.</p>

<p>For more information about shooting prize-winning landscapes, check out my <em><strong>The Photographer&#8217;s Eye</strong></em> e-book. They are only $4.99 and include 10 images, each of which illustrate a point, as well as ten tips for improving your landscape photography. If your preference is wildlife or people, I have ebooks on those topics, too. Enjoy!</p>

		  <div class="entry-content"><p>In honor of spring, when you will undoubtedly be out there trying to make up for lost camera time, here is another tip, a simple but critical one, taken from one of my <a href="http://shop.lesterpickerphoto.com/">The Photographer&#8217;s Eye</a> e-books. This one is from my <a href="http://shop.lesterpickerphoto.com/page/103">photographing wildlife e-book</a>.</p>

<p>The most critical aspect of photographing wildlife is that you have the eyes in focus.  The fact is that an animal shot can be mediocre, but if the eyes are sharp, chances are people will probably like it. If the eyes are out of focus, no amount of composition or drama will help. This is especially important when shooting tight head shots with a telephoto lens. Always stay focused on the eyes.</p>

		  <div class="entry-content"><p>To kick off spring photo season, here&#8217;s another tip from my <a href="http://shop.lesterpickerphoto.com/"><em><strong>The Photographer’s Eye Series</strong></em> </a>of e-books, this one about <a href="http://shop.lesterpickerphoto.com/page/102">photographing people</a>. This is a question I get often, during workshops that I offer, during Q&amp;A in lectures, even in casual conversation with other photographers. Do you get permission from people before photographing them?</p>

<p>As pros we have it drilled into our heads that we need permission to use an image of a person for commercial purposes. But for the amateur the situation is different. Or is it?</p>

<p>I firmly believe that it is a matter of civility, pure and simple, to ask someone you do not know for permission to photograph him or her. One of my pet peeves is the rude tourist who shoves a camera in the face of someone from a different culture. Of course, if the person is street performing that is a different story. But people have a right to privacy, and as a professional photographer I abide by that belief.</p>

<p>Permission does not have to be a signed release form. It can be a gesture- holding up your camera, pointing to it and to the subject and shrugging your shoulders as if to ask the question. Or, if you speak the language, just ask.</p>

<p><a href="http://blog.lesterpickerphoto.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/04/2006-11-ecuador1746.jpg"><img class="size-medium wp-image-2711" title="Winning Smile" src="http://blog.lesterpickerphoto.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/04/2006-11-ecuador1746-200x300.jpg" alt="" width="200" height="300"></a></p>

<p>In some countries, I’m thinking of Muslim countries in particular, photographing women without permission can get you in serious trouble. At the very least you owe it to your subject to give her a chance to cover her face.</p>

<p>Sometimes I admit to having photographed a subject surreptitiously, to catch a special moment or expression, usually at an event during which I cannot stop shooting or I will not come back with my assignment nailed. However, in that case I always go up to them afterwards, show them the images and ask if it is okay with them. Usually their smiling faces are their answer. If not, I delete the images right in front of them.</p>

<p>In <a href="http://shop.lesterpickerphoto.com/page/102">The Photographer&#8217;s Eye: People</a>, I have selected ten dramatic people images, explain how I captured them and offer suggestions for improving your people travel photography. I also have a section of ten tips that will bring your people photography to  the next level.</p>

<p> </p>

<p>Enjoy!</p>

		  <div class="entry-content"><p>As part of my Spring Into Action month, I&#8217;m sharing some tips with you from my <em>The Photographer&#8217;s Eye</em> series. This one is from <em><strong><a href="http://shop.lesterpickerphoto.com/">The Photographer&#8217;s Eye: Landscapes.</a></strong></em></p>

<p>Today&#8217;s cameras are incredible miracles, really. In essence you are holding in your little hand a computer that would have filled a good part of a room just a few decades ago. One of the most miraculous capabilities of digital cameras is their ability to capture pretty decent images in low light. They do that by making the sensor extremely sensitive to light, the same way that different films were more or less sensitive to light.</p>

<p>In the old days, there was a trade-off. The more sensitive film was to light, the more &#8220;grainy&#8221; the resulting image looked. Today we call that graininess &#8220;noise.&#8221; The biggest difference is that newer sensors have made that noise less apparent. Note I say less apparent, not entirely removed.</p>

<p>Now, in most situations, you may not notice the noise in your image. Certainly you&#8217;ll never notice it on your camera screen. Up to about ISO 800 or even 1600  (a measure of the sensor&#8217;s sensitivity to light&#8230; the higher the number the more it is able to record images in low light) you&#8217;d be hard pressed to notice the noise even on a 15&#8221; computer screen.</p>

<h3>Here Comes the Noise</h3>


<p>But, as you blow up that image that noise becomes apparent. And few things ruin a dramatic landscape image more than noise. Sometime you may want that grainy effect for creative reasons; most of the time in landscape photography you won’t. The noise will be most prominent in the shadow areas of the image. As you blow up the image beyond a print size of 8.5 x 11, the noise becomes more apparent. At 12 x 18&#8221; it starts to bother; at 16 x 24&#8221;you find yourself apologizing.</p>

<p>The answer? Simply lower your ISO when capturing landscape images.</p>

<p>Many newer cameras have their &#8220;native&#8221; ISO set at or around 200. If that&#8217;s the case with your camera, then by all means try to keep your ISO at 200 (or below). Many cameras can handle up to ISO 400 or even 800 with minimal noise, but don’t count on it. However, to effectively use ISO 200 or below you will almost always have to use tripod. All other variables being equal, as you lower the ISO you must keep open the shutter for a longer period of time to allow in enough light. To prevent hand shake during exposures a tripod and cable release are critical.</p>

<p><a href="http://blog.lesterpickerphoto.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/04/LAP3080-2-Edit-2.jpg"><img class="alignnone size-medium wp-image-2701" title="Ramparts" src="http://blog.lesterpickerphoto.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/04/LAP3080-2-Edit-2-300x199.jpg" alt="" width="300" height="199"></a></p>

<p>Many landscape images require times of 1/15 second or slower.; for silky, flowing water, many seconds. In my twenties I could hand-hold a SLR with a wide angle lens and nail it at 1/15. Nowadays, not so much. I need a tripod for probably 80-90% of my landscapes. But the trade-off of carrying one around is that you can keep your ISO low. The result? You&#8217;ll have crisper landscapes with no &#8220;noise&#8221; at all.</p>

<p>The image here was taken just after sunrise at Rampart Pond in the Canadian Rockies, when the foreground and mid-ground elements were still in shadow. I used a graduated neutral density filter to hold back the sky, but I needed a long shutter speed to capture details in the shadows. By using a tripod, I was able to keep the ISO at 100, so that the image has virtually no grain at all.</p>

<p>So, for better landscapes, lower your ISO (and use a tripod and cable release).</p>

<p><a href="http://blog.lesterpickerphoto.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/04/Northern-Lights-Award-4-of-4-300x225.jpg"><img class="size-full wp-image-2707" title="Northern-Lights-Award-4-of-4-300x225" src="http://blog.lesterpickerphoto.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/04/Northern-Lights-Award-4-of-4-300x225.jpg" alt="" width="300" height="225"></a></p>

<p>This year the award went to National Geographic photographer Catherine Karnow. My hat is off to her and the fantastic work that Nat Geo does in upping the game for all of us. The end result? Better, more dynamic photography for readers worldwide.</p>

<p><a href="http://blog.lesterpickerphoto.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/04/gallery.jpg"><img class="size-medium wp-image-2706" title="gallery" src="http://blog.lesterpickerphoto.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/04/gallery-300x216.jpg" alt="" width="300" height="216"></a></p>

<p>The Canada Northern Lights Award is judged by one of the world&#8217;s top journalism schools, the University of Missouri School of Journalism and their panel of peer reviewers. It was a high honor for me to be selected last year and I wish the very best for Catherine and the entire Nat Geo team.</p>

		  <div class="entry-content"><p>Spring means outdoors, which to me means being outdoors capturing images without going hypothermic. Spring also means that those wonderful, photogenic critters that have been holed up all winter come out to play, eat, sniff, eat, observe and eat some more.</p>

<p>In my wildlife e-book, <a href="http://shop.lesterpickerphoto.com/"><strong>The Photographer&#8217;s Eye: Wildlife</strong></a>, I share ten wildlife images that illustrate important photographic principles and explain how I got those shots. I also give ten tips that I feel are critical when attempting to snag images of wildlife that are keepers. Here&#8217;s #1 fro0m that collection of tips.</p>

<h3>Be Safe</h3>


<p>The first rule of wildlife photography is to stay safe. It sounds simple, but I have found that I need to do a mental safety check every so often because it is easy to lose oneself in the moment and forget the safety basics. Am I getting too close to the edge of the cliff in following that bird? Am I so absorbed in photographing those black bear cubs that I don&#8217;t know exactly where the momma is?</p>

<p>Always be acutely aware of your surroundings when photographing wildlife. Have an escape route mapped out in your mind. Never come between a mother and her babies (forget bears, I was almost pecked to death by an irate Arctic tern protecting its nest!).</p>

<p><a href="http://blog.lesterpickerphoto.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/04/LAP_5261-Edit.jpg"><img class="size-medium wp-image-2697" title="Gone Fishing" src="http://blog.lesterpickerphoto.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/04/LAP_5261-Edit-300x199.jpg" alt="" width="300" height="199"></a></p>

<p>If you do plan to photograph bears, a North American wildlife favorite, I strongly suggest having a trained guide with you, at least the first few times. Always keep a can of bear spray on your person. Practice and know how to use it so that if the occasion arises (let&#8217;s hope it never does!) you&#8217;ll know its limitations. Stay upwind when possible while photographing bears, so you can use the spray without it drifting back to you. That&#8217;s a very painful experience, let me tell you. Stay far away from bear cubs. An angered sow can accelerate to 30 miles per hour in seconds!</p>

<p>In the photograph here, I used a long lens to stay a safe distance from this bear. Even so, it got too close for comfort and I ended up grabbing my setup and walking away slowly, leaving all the the salmon just for him. If you click on the image and look at the claws, you&#8217;ll see why discretion is the better part of a good nature photograph.</p>

<p>Stay tuned for more tips this spring. I&#8217;ll be peppering my blogs with tips from my e-books on <a href="http://shop.lesterpickerphoto.com/">People, Landscapes and Wildlife</a>.</p>

		  <div class="entry-content"><p>It&#8217;s spring again and most of us will be heading outdoors for picnics, hiking and other events that we share with family and friends. That means taking photos of people.</p>

<p>In <em>The Photographer&#8217;s Eye: People</em>, part of my <a href="http://shop.lesterpickerphoto.com/"><em><strong>The Photographer&#8217;s Eye Series</strong></em> </a>of e-books, I include lots of illustrative images, but also ten tips to improve your people pics. I&#8217;d like to expand on #3 here: Be Patient. Sound simple? It&#8217;s not.</p>

<p>Yes, we all realize that one has to be patient to photograph little tykes. But I find that the very same thing holds true for older children and adults. Often I find that it&#8217;s not until I&#8217;ve spent a sustained chunk of time with a person, photographing, then jawing, then photographing again before I land the image I want. Sometimes that&#8217;s due to the subject relaxing, but more and more I realize it&#8217;s probably due to me getting the crappy or mundane shots out of the way before I relax enough to get to know the subject and catch that magic moment.</p>

<p><a href="http://blog.lesterpickerphoto.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/04/A03_N_010.jpg"><img class="size-medium wp-image-2693" title="Bedouin Girl" src="http://blog.lesterpickerphoto.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/04/A03_N_010-217x300.jpg" alt="" width="217" height="300"></a></p>

<p>In the case of the bedouin girl I photographed some 12 years ago, I was the guest of the sheikh of the tribe as we visited various family groups. This young girl is one of the sheikhs many nieces. I was the first non-Egyptian she had ever met. I knew I&#8217;d need to be patient to get the shot I wanted. Two days patient, that is! As you can see from the marks on her cheeks, it took a bar of very melted chocolate (110F degrees) to coax her to even look at me.</p>

<p>I am not a proponent of &#8220;Drive-by Shootings&#8221; where you point a camera at an unsuspecting native and fire away. I think that causes more ill will than drones (ok, a bit of an exaggeration). But patience with people pictures is an attitude. Try to cultivate it, commit to it and you will see your images improve dramatically.</p>

<p>Stay tuned for more tips over the next few months, taken from my e-books (People, Landscapes and Wildlife).</p>

		  <div class="entry-content"><p><em><strong>Warning: This is a shameless, unabashed fan blog. </strong></em></p>

<p>I was in bed last night decompressing from a wonderful family event, but a rough travel photography week in Colorado. I decided to thumb through some Instagram images and catch up with some blogs from fellow photographers. As it turns out, I hit upon images and a blog by one of my favorite photographers, <a href="http://www.tonysweet.com">Tony Sweet</a>. And sweet it was, as I perused and admired Tony’s latest work.</p>

<p><a href="http://blog.lesterpickerphoto.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/04/Tony_DVDEdisto40891-198x300.jpg"><img class="size-full wp-image-2687" title="Tony_DVDEdisto40891-198x300" src="http://blog.lesterpickerphoto.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/04/Tony_DVDEdisto40891-198x300.jpg" alt="" width="198" height="300"></a></p>

<p>However, it was <a href="http://tonysweet.com/2013/04/11/end-of-charleston-2013/">Tony’s latest blog</a> that put something in perspective for me. At the very least, I think it would benefit every photographer to read it.</p>

<p>Tony is surely one of the most prolific photographers on the scene today. He is a Nikon Legend Behind the Lens, and a consummate teacher of our craft. His workshops are typically sold out and highly praised, something I know personally because many of my own workshop participants speak glowingly of Tony.</p>

<p>Let’s put that all aside for the moment. Tony would be nothing if he did not also have the skills, experience and creativity to back it all up. And I’m talking creativity on steroids. Tony is so far ahead of the rest of us, we can only stand around and say: “Whew! Who was that masked man?” Or in Tony’s case, that bandana’d man, because of his trademark headwear. Never content to stand still photographically, Tony inspires me with his risk-taking. His work can be splendidly traditional or push-the-envelope edgy. It blazes new ground. It is splashes of color, riffs of mood, blurs of movement, and texture you can almost feel. One wonders where all that creative vision and professional intensity comes from.</p>

<p>Well, listen up, because Tony’s latest blog provides us with the answer; something I knew about Tony&#8217;s past, but never really grocked until now. I pulled this quote from his blog.</p>

<p> </p>

<p><em>“I have always gravitated to smaller, more intimate scenes, probably as an offshoot of my jazz musician training, where we think in terms of improvising over pre-determined musical forms and compositions and developing <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Leitmotif">leitmotifs</a>. This is the paradigm of my photography. I was a jazz artist for so long, that even as a professional photographer, I still think of myself (and probably always will) as a jazz musician first and foremost, always drawing on the mental processes and (as much as possible in this culture) the zen of a situation, emptying the mind of preconceptions and letting the image and/ or interpretation present itself. It’s all about personal interpretation.”</em></p>

<p> </p>

<p>I don&#8217;t know about you, but I find it somehow comforting that Tony has a jazz suite going  on in his head. He&#8217;s in his own world when it comes to photography, and that makes our world a whole lot better. Thanks, Tony.</p>

		  <div class="entry-content"><p>I was preparing to leave for Denver airport from Boulder, en route back home. I was pretty much packed, when I decided to give myself one last photo treat. An unusual blizzard had dumped 8-10 inches of snow along a wide swath of Colorado, but the morning dawned bright and beautiful. What&#8217;s a camera jockey to do?</p>

<p>I hurriedly grabbed my Nikon D800, my 70-200 lens and my Gitzo 3541 with RRS BH-55 ballhead and dashed out the door. I drove to Chataqua Park at the base of the foothills and did some quick pano work of the iconic Flatirons, bathed in snow and sunshine.</p>

<p>These were five vertical images, shot from a level tripod. I did not have time to put on my RRS parallax adjustment jig, nor even a polarizer. Just a few sets of click-click-click-click-click and I was out of there.</p>

<p>I pieced the image together in PTGUI, did a tonal curve sitting here at the airport and here we are. Nothing fancy, but nice use of what might otherwise have been a wasted morning.</p>

		  <div class="entry-content"><p>I attended a wonderful- and rather unique-  family event last night in downtown Denver. It was held in the iconic Clock Tower building and stretched over the four top floors in the building. Each floor had its own food offerings, plus dancing on one floor and a spectacular panoramic view of the Denver skyline from a parapet that wound around the 20th floor.</p>

<p><a href="http://blog.lesterpickerphoto.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/04/photo-copy2.jpg"><img class="size-medium wp-image-2674" title="photo copy" src="http://blog.lesterpickerphoto.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/04/photo-copy2-225x300.jpg" alt="" width="225" height="300"></a></p>

<p>Shortly after we arrived, my sister-in-law, Ruth, took out her iPhone and snapped this lovely image of the clock, from the inside of the building&#8217;s 18th floor. I was so impressed by this image for several reasons, but what it brought home to me in spades is how the creative eye trumps megapixels any day of the week.</p>

<p>It&#8217;s a strong composition, like bold paint strokes. The cut-off clock gives us a feel for the size (taller than two people atop one another). The color is nicely rendered and the contrast is perfect.</p>

		  <div class="entry-content"><p>Yesterday I received a <a href="http://www.gigapan.com">GigaPan Epic Pro</a> and I&#8217;m already impressed. I haven&#8217;t really used it yet - just a dumb indoor pano as a sort of &#8216;proof of concept&#8217; for my own edification.</p>

<p><a href="http://blog.lesterpickerphoto.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/03/epic-pro.png"><img class="size-medium wp-image-2667" title="epic-pro" src="http://blog.lesterpickerphoto.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/03/epic-pro-145x300.png" alt="" width="145" height="300"></a></p>

<p> </p>

<p>Over the next few weeks, once I&#8217;ve had a chance to look through the manual and get the apparatus up and running, I&#8217;ll report back to you on my impressions of this machine.</p>

<p>For those of you who do not know about the GigaPan technology, it is an award winning (Editor&#8217;s Choice Award from Popular Photography and American Photo) computerized robot to which you anchor your camera/lens, show it what panoramic photo you want to take, press a few buttons and PRESTO, in minutes you have a gigantonormous image with, say 10, 20, 50, even 500 Gigabytes of information in it!! No, that&#8217;s not a misprint. People have actually composed pano images with the GigaPan using a Hasselbald 50 MP camera and taking 500 images. Think of how many gigabyte files THAT produces!</p>

<p>The GigaPan is a commercial spin-off of the technology from Carnegie-Mellon University that is currently being used on the Mars Rover missions. As you can see from the photo, you mount it on your tripod , program its functions and let it rip away. Videos on the GigaPan site show you how it&#8217;s done. What attracted us is that the resulting images have such a high level of detail it should satisfy our clients&#8217; needs for ultra-large images. Last year, for example, we <a href="http://www.lesterpickerphoto.com/commercial-installations/">produced a pano image</a> that covered 30-feet by 9-feet. We did it without a GigaPan, but had we used the GigaPan it would have made the job easier and given us evenmore detail.</p>

<p>So, I can&#8217;t wait to jump in and give this baby a whirl! Stay tuned.</p>

		  <div class="entry-content"><p>Over the past few months, as my associate, Bob, and I have revised our website and planned for 2013, we have been thinking about and discussing the issue of Limited Edition prints quite a bit. They are an integral part of our business and an art form that we take particular pride in.</p>

<p>For those of you who do not know it, Bob is a Master Printer with credentials that would fill a book. We have recently been working with Museo Fine Art Digital Media and their luscious archival papers to create some of the finest photographic prints available anywhere for collectors. So, naturally, we have a lot at stake with our Limited Editions.</p>

<p><a href="http://blog.lesterpickerphoto.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/03/LAP1377.jpg"><img class="size-medium wp-image-2662" title="LAP1377" src="http://blog.lesterpickerphoto.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/03/LAP1377-300x200.jpg" alt="" width="300" height="200"></a></p>

<p> </p>

<h3>Our Process</h3>


<p>In the way of background, like some of my colleagues, our print runs are of either 10 or 25. Mostly they are 30&#8221; x 40&#8221;, but if someone custom orders a larger (or smaller) size, we count those toward the total, so that the 10 and 25 counts are never exceeded.</p>

<p>In our case, the prints are laboriously hand-made. Bob and I will sit down and carefully analyze my images for potential LE status. Once candidates are selected we apply strict criteria to them to ensure that they are truly exceptional images. Then the real work begins.</p>

<p>Dust and water spots are tediously removed. We go over every square inch of the digital image in post-processing to make sure that it will print to our highest standards, spending hours and several trial prints to &#8220;get it right.&#8221; We use our own Epson 9900 or Canon professional printers with the finest archival inks to generate our prints. We print mostly on Museo Fine Art archival, museum-quality papers. Each image is printed to order (except for ones we hang in galleries). Once dried we inspect the print and only a flawless image will get my signature.</p>

<p>Bob then prints a gorgeous Certificate of Authenticity, with several security features, so that our art clientele can feel comfortable with their purchase, knowing that if they resell it later they can prove its legitimacy.</p>

<p><a href="http://blog.lesterpickerphoto.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/03/DSC_3582.jpg"><img class="size-medium wp-image-2663" title="DSC_3582" src="http://blog.lesterpickerphoto.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/03/DSC_3582-300x200.jpg" alt="" width="300" height="200"></a></p>

<p>I&#8217;m only describing our process as an example of how I know many of my colleagues work, irrespective of print run. The question is, why do we declare so few of my images to be Limited Editions and print them in such small runs?</p>

<p> </p>

<h3>What is a Limited Edition Print? Really.</h3>


<p>The answer is fairly complex, but it mostly boils down to the fact that we take the &#8220;Limited&#8221; part of the phrase rather seriously - and very literally. Partly it is also due to the fact that I am at a different point in the arc of my work, having reached the ripe (but not old) age of 65. My kids are thankfully out of the house, and I don&#8217;t have to worry about paying the rent or putting food on the table today. And, perhaps most importantly, I am at a different place in my art where I view Limited Editions with a highly critical eye, some say too critically. If I consider an image a work of art, I want to make sure that that it will be very special to my buyers and will hold its value over time.</p>

<p>I do realize that other photographers feel very differently about Limited Editions. Some turn a lot of their images into Limited Editions. Others consider print runs of 500, 1,000 or even 5,000 to be Limited Editions (yes, I ran across this in a gallery I recently visited run by an incredibly talented photographer).</p>

<p>I am not denigrating the work of other photographers, whatever their view on Limited Editions. If a business model works for a sustained period of time, that means that happy customers are involved. But I do think that a case can be made that the concept of Limited Editions has been diluted by print runs that, by definition, can hardly be considered limited.</p>

<p><strong>And so, I turn the issue back to you readers. What do you think?</strong></p>

<p> </p>

<p>I&#8217;d like to enlist your help with something. We recently revised our website to make it more functional for our visitors. Last week we added a &#8220;Gallery&#8221; function so that you will be able to see samples of my work in various categories.</p>

<p>I would truly appreciate it if you would <a href="http://www.lesterpickerphoto.com/gallery/">visit the Gallery</a> and give me some feedback on it how it functions for you. With today&#8217;s hectic schedules I know that is asking a lot of you, but if you can swing perhaps 10 minutes, I would be very grateful.</p>

<p>Some things to consider:</p>

<p>Do you like the way the Gallery categories scroll up and down?</p>

<p>Did you try to make the images full screen (button on lower right)? If so, how did that work for you (please let us know what computer you were using and whether it was PC/Mac)?</p>

<p>Do you like the way you can view thumbnails on the bottom of the pages by running your cursor over them?</p>

<p>Any other functions you like or dislike? Any you found difficult to navigate? Any suggestions for improvement?</p>

<p>Feel free to leave your comments right here at the end of this blog. Thanks in advance for your help.</p>

		  <div class="entry-content"><p>Admittedly I have arthritis in a fairly big way, mostly in my back and neck. I like to think that it&#8217;s the result of having been stupid enough to play football in high school when I weighed 150 pounds soaking wet and my team&#8217;s offensive line averaged 205 pounds (with me on it)! But, as my wife keeps pointing out, I can hardly blame that anymore.</p>

<p>Here you can see the REAL reason for my back woes.</p>

<p><a href="http://blog.lesterpickerphoto.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/03/IMG_11522.jpg"><img class="alignnone size-medium wp-image-2647" title="IMG_1152" src="http://blog.lesterpickerphoto.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/03/IMG_11522-225x300.jpg" alt="" width="225" height="300"></a></p>

<p>We were hiking in Kipahulu, Maui when she snapped this photo. Thank God for LowePro&#8217;s terrific backpack, which serves to distribute the weight as best it can. But I&#8217;m packing 30-35 pounds of gear, PLUS my Gitzo 3541 tripod and RRS BH-55 ballhead which together weigh an additional 8 pounds. We hiked four very rugged miles that morning, before doing another strenuous hike later that day.</p>

<p>Here I am going down a trail, so you can get a better view of the pack.</p>

<p>In it I have two camera systems, each with a body and 2-3 lenses, plus filters, cleaning gear, storage cards, and assorted gizmos. Plus critically important snacks. The LowePro Trekker AW400 has a water bladder right inside the pack, making it ideal for trekking, although once in the Yukon in winter it ended up being an ice bladder.</p>

<p><a href="http://blog.lesterpickerphoto.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/03/IMG_11371.jpg"><img class="alignnone size-medium wp-image-2648" title="IMG_1137" src="http://blog.lesterpickerphoto.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/03/IMG_11371-225x300.jpg" alt="" width="225" height="300">http://blog.lesterpickerphoto.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/03/IMG_11522.jpg</a></p>

<p>My point here is that nature photography is much more than a camera and lens, especially at my age. I probably own more backpacks and cases than Imelda Marcus had shoes. But I consider them a critical investment in myself. After hours of hiking my back may be a little sore, but it&#8217;s still functional, so long as I have a solid pack that is distributed well. I am also a bug on strap adjustments and regularly empty my pack when I arrive home, clean it out and remount it on my back empty so I can check the straps and adjust them for even placement.</p>

<p>Of course, what I&#8217;m really hoping for is an eager assistant who would be willing to carry my pack for me. Dream on, right?</p>

		  <div class="entry-content"><p>I don&#8217;t mean to be alarmist, but if you are anywhere in the vicinity of where I am taking pictures, please take note. Both Nikon and Hasselblad have installed a TOP SECRET <em>MAGNETETRON</em> in their respective cameras that they sold to me. I have been aware of it for several years now, but my wife finally confirmed it with the picture below. Allow me to explain.</p>

<p>It seems as if every time I stop in a location to photograph, within a few minutes  a flock of people will suddenly stop, get out of their car, and snap away. This has happened so often I just knew that my cameras had this super-powerful magnet hidden inside that draws in people like, well, a magnet! Some examples&#8230;</p>

<p>I once had a tiny little foreign tourist actually shove me away from where I was standing and snap away with her equally tiny camera while I was photographing whales five years ago. In the Yukon I have had a busload of tourists come to a rumbling halt and disgorge 15 people, along with a cloud of dust, right where I stood with a camera and strap on my shoulder (the truth is that I had just stopped to pee, but that&#8217;s another story).</p>

<p>No matter where I am the same thing happens. Last year I was in a remote location two days from civilization and a passing hiker laden with what looked like a three-story, two-ton backpack actually stopped, took out his camera from under some pots and pans and stood not six inches from me to take a photo. Okay, I&#8217;m exaggerating&#8230; he was 12 inches from me.</p>

<p>In Hawaii last week I stopped at a lookout that barely fit two cars on a narrow, winding road overlooking a 500-foot drop. Still, several other cars stopped - one of them on the road!- and people got out to take a picture. Aha!! This time my wife caught them in the act!</p>

<p><a href="http://blog.lesterpickerphoto.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/02/IMG_1337.jpeg"><img class="size-medium wp-image-2631" title="IMG_1337" src="http://blog.lesterpickerphoto.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/02/IMG_1337-300x225.jpeg" alt="" width="300" height="225"></a></p>

<p> </p>

<p>So, there, proof of my Magnetetron theory. But, beware ladies. My Magnetetron also makes highly detailed images of your naked torsos. You have been warned!</p>

		  <div class="entry-content"><p>Today is my last day in Hawaii. After time spent on Kauai and Maui, my gear is all packed and ready for the red-eye flight back to the cold and freezing rain of Maryland.</p>

<p>In terms of photography, I felt it was a mixed bag (see my previous blogs from Hawaii). I managed to have some really good days, with outstanding images, but other days were a struggle. There were the typical weather issues (I don&#8217;t mind rain, but rain mixed with blustery winds drives me nuts!). Then on my last few days my Hasselblad malfunctioned and I&#8217;m not sure what that is all about. I&#8217;ll get it looked at as soon as I get home. However, my Nikon D800 came through for me, as Nikon invariably does. In any case, no complaints here. As George Lepp once said, there can&#8217;t be a bad day for a nature photographer. I agree. </p>

<p>So, here is my parting Hawaii image, taken with my wife&#8217;s iPhone. Until next time!</p>

		  <div class="entry-content"><p>&#8220;As ye judge, so shall ye be judged.&#8221; I recall listening to a preacher ranting about this one night many years ago as I drove home from a late night dinner meeting with a client group. The preacher, obviously possessed by some otherworldly force, admonished us sinners about not judging others because we, in turn, would be judged by them.</p>

<p>I got to thinking about that a couple of days ago as I sat here in Maui, reviewing a previous day&#8217;s shoot. Trust me when I say that not very many of the images were winners. It was the wind, or maybe the rain, or maybe… (ouch, could it have been ME?). In any case, I shrugged, laughed it off and moved on.</p>

<p><a href="http://blog.lesterpickerphoto.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/02/DSC_6330.jpg"><img class="size-medium wp-image-2622" title="DSC_6330" src="http://blog.lesterpickerphoto.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/02/DSC_6330-300x200.jpg" alt="" width="300" height="200"></a></p>

<p>I think there are two aspects of being a professional photographer that surprise most amateurs. The first is that we know when NOT to take a picture. I&#8217;ll see ten people lined up taking a shot and I know that with my particular camera-lens combo the shot just will not work, so why bother? The second characteristic of a pro is that we can shrug off a bad day and move on without beating ourselves up over it. Sure, we perform a post-mortem to avoid a repeat, but we accept that bad days, and bad images, happen.</p>

<p>Not so with many of my friends who tend to be too self-critical. I see this often in my workshops, where some people are reluctant to share their images because they feel they don&#8217;t measure up. Here is where I get back to the preacher.</p>

<p>I think most folks miss the deeper message contained in the quote. It&#8217;s not that if we judge others then others will judge us. I think it&#8217;s more like if we are the type of person who is judgmental, then we self-judge ourselves into a narrow corner. And that can be a hindrance to our development as a creative photographer.</p>

<p>So, I&#8217;m here to try to convince you to turn off the judge-o-meter. Take a second look at that image. What is there to like about it? What did you do right? Okay, so the image is way too dark in the foreground, but is the composition done well? If so, let&#8217;s learn from it. What can you do to lighten the foreground while not blowing out the sky in the background? I&#8217;m sure you get the point.</p>

<p><a href="http://blog.lesterpickerphoto.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/02/A0024674.jpg"><img class="size-medium wp-image-2623" title="A0024674" src="http://blog.lesterpickerphoto.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/02/A0024674-300x225.jpg" alt="" width="300" height="225"></a></p>

<p>As a photographer, I have seen so many images hanging on walls, some of them quite pricey, that I frankly do not like. But if it gives someone pleasure, that&#8217;s the name of the game. I personally love Degas, Renoir, Monet. I don&#8217;t get Picasso. So when I&#8217;m at a museum and I&#8217;m confronted with a Picasso, it forces me to look deeper, at the lines, the colors, the shapes. Pretty soon I get a taste of what people appreciate. Not the whole meal, mind you, but a taste.</p>

<p>Will you try it? Shut down the constricted judgments. Open up to new possibilities.</p>

		  <div class="entry-content"><p>Maui, Hawaii in February can mean only one thing- the whales are in town. Specifically, this is the time that thousands of humpbacks are in full force in Maui, frolicking in the protected area between Maui and the nearby islands of Lanai and Molokai (as well as others). And what a sight they are to behold.</p>

<p><a href="http://blog.lesterpickerphoto.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/02/DSC_5993.jpg"><img class="size-medium wp-image-2612" title="DSC_5993" src="http://blog.lesterpickerphoto.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/02/DSC_5993-300x200.jpg" alt="" width="300" height="200"></a></p>

<p>Stand on any beach from Kapalua to Wailea for more than five minutes and if you don&#8217;t see at least a dozen blows, fin slaps, and breeches you are facing away from the ocean. This federally protected area is where humpbacks come to birth calves or to breed for next year&#8217;s arrival. These whales, the size of a school bus (up to fifty feet in length) do not eat while they are here for up to five months. Instead they live on their body fat and can lose up to a third of their weight while they are here.</p>

<p><a href="http://blog.lesterpickerphoto.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/02/DSC_6046.jpg"><img class="size-medium wp-image-2613" title="DSC_6046" src="http://blog.lesterpickerphoto.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/02/DSC_6046-300x200.jpg" alt="" width="300" height="200"></a></p>

<p>Females form pods that protect any young within their care. Nearby groups of males will stage competition &#8220;battles&#8221; of pectoral fin and tail slaps, lunges and breeches to declare themselves king of the pack and desirable for nearby females. If they had a talent agent we&#8217;d be watching &#8220;Whales Gone Wild&#8221; on cable.</p>

<p>Every day, from sunrise to sunset, the whale tourism industry here in Maui caters to thousands of tourists who simply want to see these majestic animals in their breeding home. Perhaps the best known, and whose boats I use, is the Pacific Whale Foundation. They are a nonprofit whose funding goes to support whale research and educational programs. Hats off to them for the wonderful job they do educating us all on the glories and challenges of these magnificent creatures.</p>

<p>My first two trips were learning experiences for me, as I tried out a new setup. One of the trips was on an inflatable dinghy and ocean conditions made it difficult to photograph. Think of the fact that the vessel is pitching, rolling and yawing, the whales are moving, the wind is blowing and you&#8217;ve got to place an autofocus sensor dot on a creature 100 or more yards away (I am experimenting with other focus techniques, but my training keeps pulling me back to spot focus). I can&#8217;t say I&#8217;m happy with the results so far, but I have two more cruises left this year.</p>

<p><a href="http://blog.lesterpickerphoto.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/02/DSC_6493.jpg"><img class="size-medium wp-image-2614" title="DSC_6493" src="http://blog.lesterpickerphoto.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/02/DSC_6493-300x200.jpg" alt="" width="300" height="200"></a></p>

<p>In any event, here is my setup: Nikon D800 with either a 200-400mm or 70-200 lens. I mount the 200-400 on a monopod and hand-hold the 70-200. Depending on the light I am shooting at ISO 400 or 800 so I can have a <em>minimum</em> shutter speed of 1/1000 second. I shoot with an exposure adjustment of +2/3 stop so that the black body of the whales will not render totally featureless. I will sometimes use a 1.4x tele-extender, but I don&#8217;t like to do that because it restricts my vision and I miss too many shots. I&#8217;d rather wait until the captain pulls the boat closer (but boats here are restricted to 100 yards). Needless to say, this is not the situation to use filters.</p>

<p>I&#8217;m offering this not as a whale photography expert, but as a starting point for those of you just getting into it. There is one more issue I plan to talk about with whale photography, but I&#8217;ll have to wait until next week when my last two cruises are done. Stay tuned!</p>

		  <div class="entry-content"><p>I found a really sweet stream on Maui, about an hour from my hotel. But when I visited it this morning, it started to rain just as I got set up, so I&#8217;ll return at least once more to try again. The challenge is that this stream is in a generally wet part of the island and today the stream was swollen. I had to wade into it to get the shot, but if it&#8217;s much higher on my next visit I&#8217;m not sure I&#8217;ll be able to access the same spot.</p>

<p><a href="http://blog.lesterpickerphoto.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/02/A0024557.jpg"><img class="alignnone size-medium wp-image-2605" title="A0024557" src="http://blog.lesterpickerphoto.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/02/A0024557-300x225.jpg" alt="" width="300" height="225"></a></p>

<p>The saving grace is that the water is delightfully cool, perfect for water sandals. It&#8217;s very meditative, too.</p>

<p>I promised to give more technical info to you in 2013, so here goes. I used my Gitzo 3541 tripod with a Really Right Stuff BH-55 ballhead with quick release. I mounted my Hasselblad H4D-50, with a 28mm lens. I mounted my HTS1.5 tilt-shift attachment to the lens, effectively making the lens a 42mm medium format lens. That translates to about a 33mm lens in typical 35mm format. I used the tilt-shift to get good depth-of-field from foreground to background.</p>

<p>I shot at f11 and ISO 50. Now, it was pretty dark in that stream, since it sits in a valley and it was raining. To slow the water down I left on my polarizer and added a Singh-Ray 5-stop Neutral Density filter. That brought the shutter speed all the way up to 16 seconds. Here is what my setup looked like (just ignore the legs) before I had to wade deeper.</p>

<p><a href="http://blog.lesterpickerphoto.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/02/photo.jpg"><img class="size-medium wp-image-2607" title="photo" src="http://blog.lesterpickerphoto.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/02/photo-e1360788033315-225x300.jpg" alt="" width="225" height="300"></a></p>

<p> </p>

<p>The fact is that I planned to do vertical and horizontal panos of the stream, but the rain put a quick end to that plan. As soon as I get the shot nailed in good weather (how&#8217;s that for positive thinking?!), I&#8217;ll post it here, so stay tuned. I also plan to comparison shoot with my Nikon D800 and I&#8217;ll do that as a separate post. In the meantime, I hope the rain gods take a well deserved rest.</p>

		  <div class="entry-content"><p>I took this image two days ago while on the south side of Maui. The sun was fading fast and I ran out of my car, clamped my camera to the tripod and shot almost directly into the sun (the sun is a few degrees to the left). I held my hand to the side of the camera to avoid flare. The image you see here is straight out of the camera, with no post-processing, converted to a jpg for posting here on my blog.</p>

<p><a href="http://blog.lesterpickerphoto.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/02/A0024317-11.jpg"><img class="size-medium wp-image-2602" title="A0024317-1" src="http://blog.lesterpickerphoto.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/02/A0024317-11-300x225.jpg" alt="" width="300" height="225"></a></p>

<p>What appealed to me was the compositional arrangement of four horizontal slices of landscape. It was very windy, so I used a .5 second exposure to allow the grasses in the foreground to soften, although in retrospect I probably should have slowed it down even more.</p>

<p>In any event, here is what I&#8217;m asking: before I go through all the trouble of post-processing, do you think the image is worth the work? Is it salvageable? What would you suggest I do in post? Or, is it one of those all-too-typical situations of an image in the eye not quite rendering as you saw it, so culling it, grieving the loss and moving on is the best option. Watcha think?</p>

<p>Thanks in advance.</p>

		  <div class="entry-content"><p>Most people know the route as the Road to Hana. But what about the return trip, what I call the Road From Hana? Sure, many people simply turn around at Hana and drive back as they came, and there&#8217;s nothing wrong with that. The views are magnificent as I described in <a href="http://blog.lesterpickerphoto.com/2013/02/07/the-road-to-hana-part-i/">yesterday&#8217;s blog</a>.</p>

<p>But there is another way to return from a visit to glorious Hana. Just keep driving clockwise, following the shore road. At first your journey is familiar, passing through deep foliage and waterfalls. But then the vistas open up as you pass farmland and eventually open terrain that give you unobstructed views of mighty, cloud shrouded Haleakala.</p>

<p><a href="http://blog.lesterpickerphoto.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/02/A0024292-Edit.jpg"><img class="size-medium wp-image-2594  " title="A0024292-Edit" src="http://blog.lesterpickerphoto.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/02/A0024292-Edit-300x225.jpg" alt="" width="300" height="225"></a></p>

<p>Make no mistake about it, the road is rough, with a 5-mile stretch that is mostly gravel. The road immediately after Hana narrows to 1-1/2 lanes and if a car is coming from the opposite direction, one of you will have to pull over into a turnout to allow the other to get by. The road is twisty, too, but the views are utterly jaw-dropping.</p>

<h3>Iconic Stops</h3>


<p>Perhaps the most iconic stops en route back to Kahului from Hana are at The Seven Sacred Pools and the Waimoku Falls hike. The Pools are located within Haleakala National Park, so there is a $10 admission  fee. This place is well worth a stop and a photo hike. First, for the record, the Pools were so named in modern times by an engaging entrepreneur who felt that the real name, O&#8217;heo Gulch, was not exactly a turn-on to visitors. No matter, this place is a photographer&#8217;s paradise in the right weather. Unfortunately, on this visit the weather did not cooperate for me, so I can&#8217;t share an image. What you will see is a series of pools leading from the rugged ocean shore to a series of exceptionally picturesque cascading waterfalls. The view can bring tears, but you need to get there by mid-morning to avoid the crowds. You&#8217;ll want a medium tele and a longer tele to do this scene justice. If you want to shoot from the pools themselves, be very careful. You may want a moderate wide angle to take in both the foreground and the waterfall  and bridge which tower above you.</p>

<p>The hike to Waimoku Falls is one of the premier hikes on Maui (my favorite is the Haleakala Crater hike). I would categorize it as a strenuous hike for photographers, mainly because we carry so much gear. You will need a good backback to store gear because if the waterfall is running full you will have to ford two roaring streams. You cannot boulder hop them. You will get your feet wet, so hike in boots and bring along water shoes.</p>

<p>Is it worth it? How does a 400-foot tall straight drop waterfall sound? A waterfall so voluminous it creates its own wind!</p>

<p><a href="http://blog.lesterpickerphoto.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/02/A0024256.jpg"><img class="size-medium wp-image-2597" title="A0024256" src="http://blog.lesterpickerphoto.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/02/A0024256-225x300.jpg" alt="" width="225" height="300"></a></p>

<p>On this 2-mile uphill hike you will also encounter a majestic banyan tree (.5 mile mark) that begs to be photographed. Then you enter a magical bamboo forest (1 mile mark) that demands reverential attention. Then you ford two streams and finally you have earned the right to capture Waimoku on film or card.</p>

<p>A couple of hints for this hike:</p>

<ol>
<li><p>Start early. We passed some jokers who started their hike when we were coming back at 4:30.  This can actually be dangerous as the bamboo forest starts to get dark by then. Hiking down after 5:30 can be a serious mistake.</p></li>
<li><p>Wear good shoes and bring water shoes with you.</p></li>
<li><p>Plan to spend at least 4 hours if you are a photographer; perhaps 6 hours if you are a serious photographer.</p></li>
<li><p>Carry a wide angle and a medium tele or macro-tele combo. You can leave the long lens in the hotel as you are almost in the waterfall when you finally get to it.</p></li>
<li><p>Bring lunch and plenty of water with you.</p></li>
<li><p>Celebrate every moment of this hike.</p></li>
</ol>

<p> </p>

<p>The final stretch along the Pi&#8217;ilani Highway offers radically different views of Maui, from fields of cattle to sweeping views of the coast on one side and Haleakala on the other. Enough eye candy to cause an extreme high!</p>

<p>So, please don&#8217;t rush. Drive slowly, stop often, and exercise that trigger finger.</p>

		  <div class="entry-content"><p>My guess is that few travelers have not heard of The Road to Hana. It is consistently rated one of the most wondrous drives in the world, and with good reason. This 40 mile, curvy, narrow road snakes along Maui, Hawaii&#8217;s northeast shore, blessing motorists with one eye-candy scene after another. Look toward the Pacific and you see craggy coastlines being pounded by 30-foot waves. Look inland and you see spectacular waterfalls every few miles.</p>

<p><a href="http://blog.lesterpickerphoto.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/02/A0024099.jpg"><img class="size-medium wp-image-2588" title="A0024099" src="http://blog.lesterpickerphoto.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/02/A0024099-300x225.jpg" alt="" width="300" height="225"></a></p>

<p>The bamboo forests afford tons of opportunities for macro photography.</p>

<p><a href="http://blog.lesterpickerphoto.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/02/A0024246.jpg"><img class="size-medium wp-image-2589" title="A0024246" src="http://blog.lesterpickerphoto.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/02/A0024246-300x225.jpg" alt="" width="300" height="225"></a></p>

<p>This is a drive that forces you to slow down, although locals won&#8217;t even think twice of passing you going twice the speed limit around a curve. Of course the speed limit is mostly 15MPH, but most drivers learn to breath and relax on the drive. Cliff diving in a car doesn&#8217;t sound very attractive. The drive takes maybe two hours, but for a photographer, better count on at least double that.</p>

<p><a href="http://blog.lesterpickerphoto.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/02/A00242091.jpg"><img class="size-medium wp-image-2590" title="A0024209" src="http://blog.lesterpickerphoto.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/02/A00242091-225x300.jpg" alt="" width="225" height="300"></a></p>

<p>If you plan to do the Hana drive and then get back to Kihei, Kahului or Lahaina the same day,  my advice is- don&#8217;t do it. You&#8217;ll just frustrate yourself. Instead, do what I did this past week; take a full day to drive to Hana, spend the night, and then either backtrack the next day, or else complete the loop by driving back along the spectacular Pi&#8217;ilani Highway (more on that tomorrow).</p>

<p> </p>

<p>Hotel Hana</p>

<p>For more years than I care to remember, I&#8217;ve wanted to stay at the Hotel Hana, the venerable resort that was recently acquired and renamed Travaasa (what the heck??). So on this visit to Maui I scheduled an overnight stay, so I could take my time and stop wherever I wanted en route to and from this neat town. If you can swing it, a visit to Travaasa is well worth it, although we could only sample a tiny slice of what they offer in a one-night stay.</p>

<p>Travaasa is located in a drop-dead gorgeous location. All cabins have Pacific Ocean views. There&#8217;s a world-class spa, wellness center, horseback riding, hikes and more. Do as much or as little as you want. On our evening we hiked the shoreline to snag this beautiful sunset, taken from their property.</p>

<p><a href="http://blog.lesterpickerphoto.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/02/A0024202-Edit.jpg"><img class="size-medium wp-image-2587" title="A0024202-Edit" src="http://blog.lesterpickerphoto.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/02/A0024202-Edit-300x225.jpg" alt="" width="300" height="225"></a></p>

<p> </p>

<p>These images were taken on the road going to Hana and at Hana. In tomorrow&#8217;s blog I&#8217;ll discuss the drive back along the south and interior roads of the island.</p>

		  <div class="entry-content"><p>It&#8217;s probably an impossibility for a photographer to come all the way to Kauai and not hike the Kalalau Trail along the famed Na Pali coast. And with good reason. The coast is one of the most spectacular scenics on Earth. I imagine that every adult in North America has seen at least one image of Na Pali.</p>

<p>There are three ways to see the Na Pali coast; helicopter, boat and hiking. Each has its advantages and disadvantages for photographers. Helicopters, for example, are expensive, last a short time and you have to get the right type of bird and sit in the right seat to come home with the bacon. In this case the right seat means that literally. Since the helicopters must fly clockwise around the island, the right-hand seat fares the best. If the weather cooperates, you can snag some spectacular images of Na Pali from the air.</p>

<p>Boats are typically a seasonal thing, with summer weather yielding calmer seas. In winter boats are a chancy bet. You also have to use a fast shutter speed and higher ISO to get crisp, clean shots.</p>

<p>So, for me at least, hiking offers some attractive options. First, it costs next to nothing. You can take a tripod with you and you have a stable platform. The views are restricted, however. And, like any other way to get there, this one is weather dependent. There is also another <em><strong>major</strong></em> drawback. The hike is not an easy one., so be forewarned.</p>

<p>I climbed to a viewpoint at the 7/10 mile mark today. It was a beautiful day, having been dry for the past couple of days. The trail was still slippery in spots. I lugged my LowePro backpack stuffed with my Hasselblad H4D-50, 50-110mm lens, 28mm with HTS 1.5 tilt-shift, Gitzo 3541 tripod with Really Right Stuff BH-55 ballhead and leveling base, and assorted (all too heavy) paraphernalia&#8230; and water. That&#8217;s not chump change, at least not for me!</p>

<p><a href="http://blog.lesterpickerphoto.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/02/A0023953.jpg"><img class="size-medium wp-image-2582" title="A0023953" src="http://blog.lesterpickerphoto.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/02/A0023953-300x225.jpg" alt="" width="300" height="225"></a></p>

<p>The shot here was taken with the 50-110 @ 80mm, ISO 50, 1/5 second, f16. I used a polarizing filter to cut as much of the haze as possible and a 2-stop neutral density filter for part of the sky and to try to accentuate the moon on the far right side. I did take several images at 110mm so the moon was larger in the scene.</p>

<p>Here are some pointers for those of you attempting the hike for the first time. Bring water. Wear hiking shoes (no flip flops, as so many idiots, usually ages 16-25, do). Use a polarizer, as it is usually hazy. Do not go if it is raining; the trail can be dangerously slippery. Wear sunscreen. If you intend to do the 8-mile round trip to the waterfall, leave early. Have fun!</p>

<p>If you have specific questions about the hike, feel free to leave a comment and I&#8217;ll respond.</p>

		  <div class="entry-content"><p>I&#8217;m excited to announce the winners of our <a href="http://blog.lesterpickerphoto.com/2012/12/02/bird-photography-contest/">First Annual Bird Photography Contest</a>. We instituted this contest for two reasons; first to tip our hats to the dedicated birders of the Annual Christmas Bird Count who help us gauge the health of our natural environment, and second to give credit to bird photographers everywhere. I acknowledge their skills and perseverance precisely because I am so damned bad at it!</p>

<p>There were supposed to be First, Second and Third place awards, but we had a hard time choosing the Second place winner, so in the end we are giving four awards from the many submissions. What great images! This contest was tough to judge, but I&#8217;ll give you an idea of why we chose these winners. Here, then, are the recipients, along with some words from them. C<em>lick on the images to see larger versions. </em></p>

<p><a href="http://blog.lesterpickerphoto.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/01/loon-feeding-chick-July2010-363.jpeg"><img class="size-medium wp-image-2568" title="loon-feeding-chick-July2010-363" src="http://blog.lesterpickerphoto.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/01/loon-feeding-chick-July2010-363-300x231.jpeg" alt="" width="300" height="231"></a></p>

<p><strong>First Place</strong> goes to Keith Carver who took this wonderful image on Damariscotta Lake in Maine. What struck us about this image is the intimacy of the mother feeding a crayfish to her chick. Better yet, Keith chose to crop out the extraneous parts of the image to focus on its essence (see my blog on <a href="http://blog.lesterpickerphoto.com/2012/11/08/finding-the-essence/">essence</a>). I love how elegant it is in its simplicity, with the somewhat overblown, featureless water drawing the viewers&#8217; eyes to the focal point. That turns a mere bird identification photo into a magical story. &#8220;It was taken in early July, 2010 on Damariscotta Lake,&#8221; Keith tells us. &#8220;Cropped to about 60% of the <a href="http://krcarver.zenfolio.com/p896543188/h29ce259#h29ce259">full frame image</a>.  The chick was about three weeks old at the time, and survived the snappers and herring gulls to grow to a grayish teenager by late September when I last saw him.&#8221;</p>

<p>Photo details:  Canon EOS 1D Mk III, 500 mm IS with 1.4X extender (700 mm), 1/1250 sec, f/5.6, ISO 400, Aperture priority, exposure bias +1 stop</p>

<p><strong>Second Prizes</strong> go to John Sternbergh for his Tanzanian Red-Billed Hornbill eating a frog and to Andy Anderson for his capture of an osprey in flight with a fish in its talons.</p>

<p> </p>

<p><a href="http://blog.lesterpickerphoto.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/01/Red-billed-Hornbill-John-Sternbergh.jpg"><img class="size-medium wp-image-2570" title="Red-billed Hornbill - John Sternbergh" src="http://blog.lesterpickerphoto.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/01/Red-billed-Hornbill-John-Sternbergh-300x225.jpg" alt="" width="300" height="225"></a></p>

<p>In John&#8217;s image, talk about being in the right place at the right time and with the right equipment! What we liked about this image is the action and the tack-sharp eye of the hornbill (with a slight catch-light to boot!).</p>

<p>Photo details: Nikon D700, AF-S VR Nikkor 200-400mm @ 330mm, f5.6, 1/200, -1.67EV, ISO 200</p>

<p> </p>

<p><a href="http://blog.lesterpickerphoto.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/01/Osprey1.jpg"><img class="size-medium wp-image-2571" title="Osprey1" src="http://blog.lesterpickerphoto.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/01/Osprey1-300x214.jpg" alt="" width="300" height="214"></a></p>

<p>Andy&#8217;s image captured the action of the osprey with an alewife in its talons. Note the sharp eye and the talons dug into the hapless fish. As Andy tells it:</p>

<p>&#8220;This is a photo of an osprey carrying off an alwive taken in Orland, Maine, on the saltwater side of the dam. My wife and I went there on my motorcycle because we heard from one of her patients (she&#8217;s a nurse) that the ospreys were hunting in the deep pool at the base of the fish ladder.  One or two would hang out on this tall dead tree nearby and watch for an opportunity for a free lunch.  At the time, I was using a Nikon D200, with a Nikon 70-300mm f/4.5-5.6.&#8221;</p>

<p>The <strong>Third Place</strong> image could have placed First in virtually any competition. Michael Allie&#8217;s Great-Horned Owl is striking in its pose, its in-your-face stare, its tack sharpness and its surroundings to give context. The only thing that held it back in this competition was my proclivity for images that tell stories or show action.</p>

<p><a href="http://blog.lesterpickerphoto.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/01/MDA_6014.jpg"><img class="size-medium wp-image-2572" title="MDA_6014" src="http://blog.lesterpickerphoto.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/01/MDA_6014-300x198.jpg" alt="" width="300" height="198"></a></p>

<p>Photo details: Nikon D7000, Tamron 70-300MM lens at 217mm, ISO 800, f7.1, 1/1250.</p>

<p>We also wanted to extend an Honorable Mention to Danny Pickens for his image of a Night Heron trying to tempt his mate. Keep up the good work, Danny, and submit another one for next year&#8217;s contest.</p>

<p><a href="http://blog.lesterpickerphoto.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/01/IMG_0362a1.jpg"><img class="size-medium wp-image-2574" title="Yellow-Crowned Night Heron" src="http://blog.lesterpickerphoto.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/01/IMG_0362a1-300x200.jpg" alt="" width="300" height="200"></a></p>

<p>Thanks to all who submitted images to the contest and a hearty congrats to our winners. Like I always say, judging these contests is terribly subjective and does not in any way reflect on the quality of those images not selected.</p>

<p><em><strong>Now a note to the winners</strong></em>: I am in Hawaii right now and won&#8217;t be back until Feb 26. I will contact you all individually shortly after my return with information about the prizes. Thanks for your patience. Feel free to contact me as I will have email throughout.</p>

		  <div class="entry-content"><p>It was late in the day when I decided to check out the Waimea Canyon drive. I was actually on my way to a beach to photograph sunset, but I did a quick detour because I hadn&#8217;t been up the mountain in 5 years. Waimea Canyon is known as the Grand Canyon of the Pacific, and while the moniker is worthy, the visual comparison is not. Imagine the Grand Canyon with lush green accents and sheer cliffs leading to the Pacific Ocean. Within the Waimea Canyon State Park is Mount Wai&#8217;ale&#8217;ale, considered the wettest place on Earth, with an average of 452 inches of rain a year and a record of 683! That is why the Park has some spectacular waterfalls.</p>

<p>The first overlook was socked in with fog, so we drove a bit further and I took some quick snaps of the Pacific side of the canyon. The clouds come in from the ocean and hit the cliffs and swirl around in a mesmerizing dance. At times you are totally enveloped in clouds, which is a wonderful sensory experience, although if you are standing on the edge of a cliff you&#8217;d better stay still until it clears. Here is a sample. I&#8217;ll plan to go back later this week and spend more quality time there, weather permitting.</p>

<p><a href="http://blog.lesterpickerphoto.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/01/A0023790.jpg"><img class="alignnone size-medium wp-image-2565" title="A0023790" src="http://blog.lesterpickerphoto.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/01/A0023790-300x225.jpg" alt="" width="300" height="225"></a></p>

<p> </p>

<p>BTW, that &#8220;little&#8221; detour ending up costing me the sunrise, as I raced (well, you don&#8217;t actually race in Hawaii, where the top speed limit is 50 mph) the setting sun and ending up on the losing end. Like I said, there&#8217;s always next time.</p>

		  <div class="entry-content"><p>I recall cruising on board a small ship in the Galapagos on one of my trips there. Each morning our wonderful tour guide, a local, would waken the 16 passengers with the following announcement: &#8220;Good morning everyone. Welcome to another beautiful day in paradise.&#8221; And to an ecologist like myself, the Galapagos islands are truly a paradise.</p>

<p>But, make no mistake about it. The Galapagos islands are hardly tropical paradises. For that, you have to go to the Hawaiian Islands and, more specifically, Kauai, the Garden Island. Next to the Arctic and sub-Arctic climes that I love, Kauai and Maui are two of my favorite places. We arrived three days ago and we&#8217;ve already covered several of my favorite sunrise and sunset spots.</p>

<p>It took only a day for Kauai&#8217;s magic to work its way into our soul. It&#8217;s a magical stew, here. First there is the eye candy of verdant valleys and soaring cliffs and banks of the most luscious clouds imaginable. Then there are the sounds of the ocean ebbing and flowing and pounding at the island that was ironically formed from the sea.</p>

<p>There is also the island lifestyle; speed limits mostly are 25-35mph, with occasional reckless 50 mph stretches. There is the Aloha spirit and everyone still says mahalo (thank you). We talked with an employee at Costco here who acknowledged that, yes, costs are high and sadly wages are low but, hey, that&#8217;s the price of living in paradise. You don&#8217;t eat out much, but the trade-off is worth it.</p>

<p><a href="http://blog.lesterpickerphoto.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/01/A0023737.jpg"><img class="alignnone size-medium wp-image-2561" title="A0023737" src="http://blog.lesterpickerphoto.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/01/A0023737-300x225.jpg" alt="" width="300" height="225"></a></p>

<p>On our first full day in Kauai I drove to the base of the Na Pali coast. It had rained heavily the previous two days so I decided to stay through sunset and was treated to a magnificent scene looking down the silhouetted Na Pali coastline. The waves were thunderous, cresting at 20-30 feet, another demonstration of nature&#8217;s awesome power.</p>

<p>Now it&#8217;s on to other island adventures before we take off for Maui and some of its treasures. Stay tuned!</p>

		  <div class="entry-content"><p>Before I left for Yellowstone a couple of weeks ago, I was anxious about only one photographic issue. How would my Hasselblad H4D batteries perform in the cold weather?</p>

<p><a href="http://blog.lesterpickerphoto.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/01/imgres-1.jpeg"><img class="size-medium wp-image-2555" title="imgres-1" src="http://blog.lesterpickerphoto.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/01/imgres-1-300x165.jpeg" alt="" width="300" height="165"></a></p>

<p>Of course Hasselblad is a superb camera system, second to none and I love its luscious, film-like images and incredible dynamic range. Those of you who follow my blog know that I shoot Nikon and Hasselblad. But ever since I started using Hassy, I have been disappointed in its battery capacity. My Nikon D200, D300, D700 and now the D800 keep going and going, like the Energizer bunny. I can get 1,000 clicks and more from a single charge. But with my Hassy, if I got 100 shots outdoors I considered myself fortunate. So I was apprehensive prior to leaving for the north.</p>

<p>Then, one day while researchiong the issue of the Internet, I found a post by &#8220;HLArt&#8221; on the Hasselblad Digital Forum. I followed his advice and I haven&#8217;t had a problem in normal temps ever since. But Yellowstone in winter was far different!</p>

<p>Well, I am happy to report that my Hassy batteries lasted either all day or close to it, and that was at temps that fluctuated between -13F to +25 (mostly below zero). For those of you who follow such things or are frustrated by your Hassy batteries, may I recommend HLArt&#8217;s procedure, which I quote here in its entirety.</p>

<p>&#8220;So here&#8217;s how to reset an H battery if it is not holding a charge or not lasting as long as it should.
First charge the battery fully, preferably overnight.
Then grab an H body with no battery on it and press and hold the &#8220;menu&#8221; and &#8220;flash&#8221; buttons, and while holding them down push the battery up onto the handgrip. You should then here a rapid series of beeps indicating the PMU on the battery has been reset. Now put the battery back on charge and it should improve performance.</p>

<p>On a side note new batteries will have a low initial capacity, cycle them through charge discharge (on the camera) a few times to get full capacity.&#8221;</p>

<p>Many thanks to HLArt from me and any Hassy users who may benefit from my reposting his advice. It sure worked for me!</p>

		  <div class="entry-content"><p>I just returned from a rejuvenating trip to Yellowstone, a winter paradise if there ever was one. The temps ranged from -13F to +25F, far warmer than I had hoped, since I wanted to get the frosty breath of bison as they grazed. Still, just being out in our glorious natural world was reward enough. I did manage to see bison, coyotes, eagles (bald and golden), elk, mule deer, pronghorn antelope and three wolf packs, although the latter were too far away to photograph.</p>

<p><a href="http://blog.lesterpickerphoto.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/01/A0023497.jpg"><img class="size-medium wp-image-2548" title="A0023497" src="http://blog.lesterpickerphoto.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/01/A0023497-300x225.jpg" alt="" width="300" height="225"></a></p>

<p>One of the most frequently asked questions I get about winter photography is how to photograph snow. Moose Peterson, a terrific wildlife photographer, recently had a blog on the topic where he recommends pushing your exposure a stop or two over your meter reading to get snow white. I agree with his advice, with a caveat.</p>

<p><a href="http://blog.lesterpickerphoto.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/01/A0023499.jpg"><img class="alignnone size-medium wp-image-2550" title="A0023499" src="http://blog.lesterpickerphoto.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/01/A0023499-300x150.jpg" alt="" width="300" height="150"></a></p>

<p>If one doesn&#8217;t over-expose snow scenes, they will render a sickening gray color, due to the meter&#8217;s attempt to &#8220;neutralize&#8221; the scene and render the scene close to 18% gray. The typical thing to do is to open up a stop or two (or even 3) to get the snow to look white. The trouble is that photographers are afraid of blowing out the snow, meaning that the overexposure is so extreme all detail is lost in the snow. As soon as they see blinkies appear on their camera screens, they dial back. But when they get home they realize that  the snow scenes did not come out as they were hoping.</p>

<p>The reason I&#8217;m writing about this now is that something interesting happened after I uploaded my images to my home system. My assistant, Bob Boyer, is an accomplsihed indoor photographer and has a long career in working with models. Frankly, he is an expert on lighting who knows more about the science of it than anyone I have ever known.</p>

<p>While I was in Yellowstone, Bob was busily working on his own photo project back home, helping a young woman develop a modeling portfolio. He showed me a sample shot he took:</p>

<p> </p>

<p><a href="http://blog.lesterpickerphoto.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/01/DSC_2603.jpg"><img class="size-medium wp-image-2549" title="DSC_2603" src="http://blog.lesterpickerphoto.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/01/DSC_2603-300x200.jpg" alt="" width="300" height="200"></a></p>

<p> </p>

<p>Now, it may not occur to you, but the three shots here have striking similarities, and I do not mean that as an insult to this stunning model. Those similarities hold a valuable lesson for landscape and wildlife photographers. In both cases we have strong lighting on the subject, in my image natural lighting and in Bob&#8217;s case mixed lighting. There are even similar tones in the bisons&#8217; coats and the model&#8217;s hair. But for the present case, ignore those similarities.</p>

<p>What is notable is that in both cases the foreground is blown out. In Bob&#8217;s image he literally smashed his histogram purposely up against the right wall, far right of 255.  In my case I pushed to the right, but not quite to the wall. In retrospect, I should have shot a few frames another 1/2-1 stop to the right. I might have gotten more detail in the coats and faces of the bison. And what would I have lost? What did Bob lose in his image? Does anyone give a darn that the sheet in the foreground of the model is so overblown that there is no detail in it whatsoever? Hardly. Our brain interprets the scene and understands the context. The white represents sheets, or in my case snow, and we focus on the model or bison with no hesitation. The model&#8217;s face and body are perfectly exposed, a compelling high-key image.</p>

<p>The lesson here is that we should understand the limits of our cameras. We need to respect the abilities of these amazing machines, but be willing to outsmart them for creative purposes.</p>

		  <div class="entry-content"><p>If there is one iconic species in Yellowstone, it would have to be the Bison. These immense creatures are the largest land mammals in America, with the bulls weighing around 2,000 pounds! Yellowstone bison were nearly eradicated by 1900, but in one of the most visible successes in the wildlife movement, Yellowstone now is home to between 3,000 and 4,000 of these magnificent creatures.</p>

<p>In winter one has to share the road with bison, as you can see here in my 20-second little iPhone <a href="http://youtu.be/MsbIXWhA3Xc">video clip</a>. (NOTE: Please turn down your sound as the day was biting cold (-10F) and very windy). The bison graze for a few hours in the early morning, chew their cud and then mosey to a new location for their afternoon grazing. One gets a sense of just how difficult it is to survive through the winter in these parts. The bison use their nose and massive head as snowplows as they swing it from side to side, burrowing down into the snow to get to the dried grasses beneath. That chore is energy intensive, especially inm the cold, so these guys have to eat massive am0unts of forage.</p>

<p><a href="http://blog.lesterpickerphoto.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/01/DSC_5329.jpg"><img class="size-medium wp-image-2544" title="DSC_5329" src="http://blog.lesterpickerphoto.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/01/DSC_5329-300x200.jpg" alt="" width="300" height="200"></a></p>

<p> </p>

<p>It seems as if wherever one drives there are small herds of bison grazing in fields. They are skitterish and now that packs of wolves hunt in Yellowstone, they are constantly on alert. But humans, too, are well advised to keep their distance as every year people are hurt here when they approach too closely. Despite their size they can charge to 30mph incredibly quickly.</p>

<p><a href="http://blog.lesterpickerphoto.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/01/DSC_5358.jpg"><img class="alignnone size-medium wp-image-2545" title="DSC_5358" src="http://blog.lesterpickerphoto.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/01/DSC_5358-300x200.jpg" alt="" width="300" height="200"></a></p>

<p> </p>

<p>Once I get back home I leave in six days for another outing, this time for a month. But as soon as I can I&#8217;ll process my Yellowstone images and post some of them them on my blog.</p>

		  <div class="entry-content"><p>The frigid weather in Yellowstone cleared by mid-morning and by mid afternoon the temp hit a balmy 24 degrees. No more pain when taking off gloves to adjust something on the camera.</p>

<p>I did a two hour snowshoe trek to take photos of a tree-rock grouping, but when all was said and done I&#8217;m not liking the results on my laptop. I&#8217;ll hold off final judgment until I get home to a normal desktop screen.</p>

<p>On the way out of the park towards dusk, my colleague spotted a bighorn sheep ram on the side of a cliff and we pulled over to photograph. This guy was a gorgeous specimen, shown here eating some dried grasses (captured with a Nikon D800, 200-400mm Nikkor lens, Gitzo 3541 and RRS BH-55 ballhead, ISO 1600, f5.6, 1/800 sec).</p>

<p><a href="http://blog.lesterpickerphoto.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/01/DSC_5005.jpg"><img class="alignnone size-medium wp-image-2540" title="DSC_5005" src="http://blog.lesterpickerphoto.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/01/DSC_5005-200x300.jpg" alt="" width="200" height="300"></a></p>

<p> </p>

<p>I watched as he foraged his way down the cliffside, all the while looking up to the other side of a creek, where a female stood right at the top of the ridge line. Finally, he came down to the road, ran across and down the embankment to the stream. He walked back and forth, as if deciding whether or not to cross.</p>

<p><a href="http://blog.lesterpickerphoto.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/01/DSC_4979.jpg"><img class="size-medium wp-image-2541" title="DSC_4979" src="http://blog.lesterpickerphoto.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/01/DSC_4979-300x200.jpg" alt="" width="300" height="200"></a></p>

<p> </p>

<p>Truth be told, he did turn around and run back up the cliff where we first spotted him. His libido was just no match for the frigid river.</p>

<p>Tomorrow is supposed to be the same temps, but more blue sky, so I&#8217;m psyched!</p>

		  <div class="entry-content"><p>My first full day in Yellowstone dawned gray, misty and freezing cold. Actually, it was way below freezing, namely -7 when I awoke, warming to 9 degrees F at 3:00 PM. The first day on site anywhere I travel is always an adjustment day, including deciding what lenses to bring, how to arrange everything in the car for quick access, debugging equipment that is resistant in below zero temps, and how best to dress while still being able to manipulate those teeny camera controls.</p>

<p>In winter there is only one road open to cars and that is the north entrance to the northeast entrance. Miserable as the day&#8217;s weather was we were able to spot herds of bison, elk and mule deer, a lone moose, three wolves, and two coyotes.</p>

<p>The most fun was photographing the coyote, despite his distance. He was at the far range of how I like to shoot my Nikkor 200-400mm lens, which is not to say I didn&#8217;t try. What attracted me in the first place  was the fact that he was hunting meadow voles and burying his face deep in the snow to sniff them out. Here&#8217;s a quick capture of him. Not a quality image, but it was late in the afternoon and I had a touch of altitude sickness all day, meaning I was shooting through a throbbing headache. But, then again, you&#8217;ve heard me say many times before that I never judge an outing solely by the images I bring back. For me, just being out there in this beautiful, natural world is reward enough.</p>

<p> </p>

<p><a href="http://blog.lesterpickerphoto.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/01/DSC_4746-Edit.jpg"><img class="alignnone size-medium wp-image-2535" title="DSC_4746-Edit" src="http://blog.lesterpickerphoto.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/01/DSC_4746-Edit-300x200.jpg" alt="" width="300" height="200"></a></p>

<p>Tomorrow I&#8217;m looking at the potential for better weather, although things shift fast up here at 6,200-8,500 feet. I&#8217;d like to get a few good bison images, as well as some landscapes. I&#8217;ll keep you posted. In the meantime, stay warm&#8230; for me.</p>

<p>Well, we arrived in Yellowstone National Park around 3:30 PM, far too late to photograph anything. My friend, Sherif Osman, and I took a quick jaunt through the park just to get our bearings. It was a foggy, cold, windy day, with temperatures around zero Fahrenheit. The sun had already set behind the mountains, but there was enough diffuse light for some amazing sightings. In just over an hour we saw mule deer, elk, and bison. As we rounded a bend on the park road, we saw some slow moving traffic coming our way. I thought I&#8217;d share that tiny <a href="http://youtu.be/MsbIXWhA3Xc">20-second iPhone video</a> with you. Man, those animals are big!</p>

<p>Stay tuned for more, as tomorrow we begin our photo safari.</p>

		  <div class="entry-content"><p>Hello. My name is Les Picker and I&#8217;ve never been to Yellowstone. There, I said it! This is like AA for a landscape photographer like me. For 20 years Yellowstone National Park naturally comes up in conversations with my colleagues and I have to say I&#8217;ve never been.</p>

<p>&#8220;You&#8217;ve never been to Yellowstone?&#8221; they&#8217;ll ask, wide-eyed, all the while backing away as if I have a communicable disease.</p>

<p>It&#8217;s not that I never wanted to go. Honest. It&#8217;s been on my must-see list for years. It&#8217;s just that life gets in the way and I&#8217;ve never carved out the time. Well, that will change next week. I needed to be in Denver for a family event and I decided to use that as a take-off point for a 5-day jaunt into Yellowstone&#8217;s winter landscapes.</p>

<p>While it will be my first trip there, I usually do not travel to a place unless I plan on coming back. That&#8217;s because it takes me a while to get a lay of the land, to see what angles I&#8217;d like to take, to get the weather conditions right, and to understand the compositions inherent in the landscape. For me, that usually doesn&#8217;t happen on one short trip.</p>

<p>On this trip I&#8217;ll be taking my two trusty camera systems; Hasselblad and Nikon. For the Hassy H4D I decided to take my 28mm, tilt-shift attachment, 50-110mm, and 300mm. For my Nikon system I&#8217;ll be taking my D800, 24mm tilt-shift, 70-200mm and 200-400mm. Of course I&#8217;ll also have with me various filters and tons of batteries. I&#8217;m limiting my gear because I also have to pack snowshoes, and many layers of clothing.</p>

<p>My plan is to shoot early morning and dusk landscapes and animals, but also night shots, so sleep will have to wait until I get back. My hope is that I&#8217;ll also be able to grab an aurora image or two.</p>

<p><a href="http://blog.lesterpickerphoto.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/01/northernlights1.jpg"><img class="size-medium wp-image-2523" title="northernlights1" src="http://blog.lesterpickerphoto.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/01/northernlights1-199x300.jpg" alt="" width="199" height="300"></a></p>

<p>Anyway, please stay tuned as I will try to post a blog or two during my stay. And, if you&#8217;ve already visited Yellowstone in winter, I would love to get your recommendations on places to shoot.</p>

		  <div class="entry-content"><p>2012 was quite a year for us at <a href="http://www.lesterpickerphoto.com">Les Picker Fine Art Photography</a>. One of my favorite things was dialoging with you, my loyal readers, over a range of issues. You had questions for me, but also took the time to respond to questions I asked. For that I thank you.</p>

<h3>Making a Living</h3>


<p>This past year my travels took me to some interesting places, including Canada, <a href="http://blog.lesterpickerphoto.com/2012/05/09/iceland-saga-snaefellsnes/">Iceland</a>, <a href="http://blog.lesterpickerphoto.com/2012/04/14/sri-lanka%E2%80%99s-incredible-yala-national-park/">Sri Lanka</a>, <a href="http://blog.lesterpickerphoto.com/2012/03/25/israel-a-nation-of-stark-contrasts/">Israel</a>, and <a href="http://blog.lesterpickerphoto.com/2012/02/17/a-cold-night-in/">Finland</a>. In the States, I taught a workshop for the Nikonians Academy in Acadia National Park, a location I know and love, having done graduate school research in that gorgeous park. Yes, I feel fortunate to travel to some iconic places as a landscape and travel photographer, but oddly enough it is the wonderful people that I get to meet that makes my trips so special.</p>

<p><a href="http://blog.lesterpickerphoto.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/12/People-2-of-7.jpg"><img class="size-medium wp-image-2511" title="People 2 of 7" src="http://blog.lesterpickerphoto.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/12/People-2-of-7-240x300.jpg" alt="" width="240" height="300"></a></p>

<p>We also revamped <a href="http://www.lesterpickerphoto.com">our website</a> last month. There is still work to be done on it, but I&#8217;d love to get your feedback at this point to better inform our efforts. Please take a gander at the site and then leave your comments.</p>

<p>We also staged our <a href="http://www.magicinkjet.com/pages.php?name=les_picker_photography_case_study">largest permanent photo installation</a> yet, with more than 60 of my images placed in a new medical wing at Sinai Hospital in Baltimore, Maryland. We have an amateurish, but funny, <a href="http://blog.lesterpickerphoto.com/2012/09/17/wallpaper-mural/">1-minute video</a> showing the installation of one of our large wallpaper murals. Bob Boyer, our Master Printer, outdid himself in churning out some exceptional, finely detailed prints of my work. But we are also grateful to Museo Fine Art papers for their support. In case you haven&#8217;t realized from reading my blogs, we love, love, love the luscious Museo papers.</p>

<p>We also managed to put out another e-book in my series entitled <a href="http://shop.lesterpickerphoto.com">The Photographer&#8217;s Eye</a>. We now have three ebooks: Landscape, People and Wildlife.</p>

<p>Finally, I was incredibly honored to be given the prestigious<a href="http://blog.lesterpickerphoto.com/2012/07/19/worth-the-wait/"> Canada Northern Lights Award</a> for Best Travel Photography for 2011.</p>

<h3>Looking Ahead to 2013</h3>


<p>This year&#8217;s travel promises to be the most rigorous in several years. I start in Yellowstone in January, hoping to get some quality winter landscapes and wildlife. Then it&#8217;s off to Hawaii, which includes a 2-day hike down Haleakala crater with an Aussie couple that I met entirely by chance as I photographed a sunrise in Acadia last Fall. These nice folks have visited every National Park in the continental U.S. and I&#8217;ll lead then down the crater during their visit to that Park.</p>

<p> </p>

<p><a href="http://blog.lesterpickerphoto.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/12/PICKER-AAR-sample-20-of-20.jpg"><img class="size-medium wp-image-2513" title="PICKER-AAR sample 20 of 20" src="http://blog.lesterpickerphoto.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/12/PICKER-AAR-sample-20-of-20-300x184.jpg" alt="" width="300" height="184"></a></p>

<p>After Hawaii they&#8217;ll only have Alaska&#8217;s National Parks to go. What a great accomplishment!</p>

<p>In May I&#8217;ll be in Italy and Malta. In June I&#8217;ll spend a couple of weeks RV-ing around British Columbia with my good friend Ed Hill, a retired Royal Canadian Mounted Police officer. No one knows BC better than Ed, an outdoorsman who served as a Mountie there for more than 30 years.</p>

<p>In August I return to Canada, this time to Banff and Jasper in the Canadian Rockies. This year I&#8217;ll try to avoid a bear encounter. In the past two years I&#8217;ve had two uncomfortable &#8220;meetings&#8221; with a black bear and a Grizzly. What beautiful animals!</p>

<p>Then it&#8217;s on to Sri Lanka in September, where I lead a <a href="http://www.nikoniansacademy.com/all/viewWorkshop.html?course_id=1062">workshop for Nikonians</a> and then two more <a href="http://www.nikoniansacademy.com/all/viewWorkshop.html?course_id=1057">workshops in Maine</a> in October. Last year&#8217;s workshop sold out, so if you&#8217;re interested, book early. November and December are not yet set, but I&#8217;m hoping for a trip to Africa.</p>

<p>We&#8217;ll also be doing two very exciting- and very different- photo workshops this year, but plans are still forming. I will announce them as soon as they are finalized.</p>

<h3>Sound Like a Dream?</h3>


<p>But, don&#8217;t let this seemingly idyllic travel fool you. It is work; hard work. Traveling today is a mess, pure and simple. Every week seems to bring new restrictions that make travel for a pro photographer miserable. Aside from all the things that affect our livelihood- like excess baggage fees, and the minor annoyances including long lines, and the arbitrary inspections of every camera, lens and accessory- there is the constant need to secure one&#8217;s equipment from theft and damage. I&#8217;ve lost thousands of dollars worth of equipment in recent years.</p>

<p>I also rarely get anyone else to make my travel arrangements, so in addition to prepping photographically, there are all the flights, lodging, transportation, research on photo locations, and even <a href="http://blog.lesterpickerphoto.com/2012/12/16/a-good-guide-is-heaven-sent/">hiring guides</a> when necessary. There were also the two occasions when I rolled back the covers in my motel room and had very special greetings, courtesy of a horde of bedbugs!</p>

<p>At my age, it&#8217;s often not fun to trudge up mountains with a 35-pound backpack or stand in -40 temperatures for 5 hours in the dead of night photographing the Northern Lights. But, I wouldn&#8217;t trade those inconveniences for anything. And here&#8217;s why.</p>

<p>If you want to feel how insignificant you really are, stand on a mountain in the Arctic at 2:00 AM as the Northern Lights suddenly flair to life (the first time I witnessed them, I cried). Or sit at the edge of the Grand Canyon at dawn as a condor with a 10-foot wingspan rides a thermal right in front of you.</p>

<p>I don&#8217;t like churches and synagogues. I personally can&#8217;t imagine that the way to get close to the Creator force is to sit in neat rows inside four walls. The only times I feel a spiritual connection is when I&#8217;m &#8220;out there&#8221; in the wild, recording nature. I stop, look around me and am always amazed at the abundance of life and its beauty. I breathe in the intoxicating forest smells and listen to the glorious sounds of a brook, birds flitting and singing around me. That&#8217;s when I know in my heart and soul that I wouldn&#8217;t trade what I do for any job in the world.</p>

<p>Here&#8217;s to a wonderful 2013 for us all!</p>

		  <div class="entry-content"><p>One thing we don’t often discuss in travel writing and photojournalism circles is the art of guiding. Few things can make or break a long sought after vacation or travel adventure than a guide.</p>

<p>I was reminded of this on my just-ended trip to Israel, where I was blessed to have a professional guide by the name of Jacky Sivak every day of my 10-day tour. I’m really not the tour type, but I have to say that Jacky made every moment enjoyable. I’d take a tour with her any day.</p>

<p>As a registered tour guide, Jacky obviously had to meet the minimum standards of her industry. But what differentiated Jacky, and all good guides, from the merely mediocre, is her passion for what she does and her incredible grasp of historical fact and current facts-on-the-ground in Israel. This woman truly loves what she does and it shines.</p>

<p>I’ll link this to photography by saying that a good guide is nearly a must when you visit an area that you’d like to extensively photograph for the first time. A guide will impart to you knowledge gained from years of experience.</p>

<p>The absolutely best, most ideal situation is when your guide is also willing to help you porter your equipment. Ah, the relief, the joy, the luxury of that! Sharing the load allows you to concentrate on your photography. In most developing countries fees for such people are reasonable and provide critical revenue for your guide.</p>

<p>I had just such an experience most recently in Sri Lanka, where several regional guides helped me to carry my 30 pounds of equipment (I shoot Hasselblad and Nikon). My best situation was my driver, guide and porter rolled into one in a quiet, generous and industrious man named Susil Ranjith. Although his English was a bit rough (my Sri Lankan is totally nonexistent!), we still managed to communicate. After one day, Susil began anticipating my moves and would have my tripod legs extended, or my backpack held out in his hands ready for me to unzip and remove my gear. By the third day, I swear, he was suggesting excellent photo targets to me, even driving me to out of the way places that he thought would work.</p>

<p><a href="http://blog.lesterpickerphoto.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/12/A0019129.jpg"><img class="size-medium wp-image-2501" title="A0019129" src="http://blog.lesterpickerphoto.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/12/A0019129-300x225.jpg" alt="" width="300" height="225"></a></p>

<p> </p>

<h3>A half-dozen tips for guides</h3>


<ol>
<li>
<strong>Ask around</strong>. Ask for recommendations from friends who have been to a locale you wish to visit</li>
    <li>
<strong>Check references</strong>. It is perfectly appropriate to ask a guide for recent references. Make up a list of characteristics that would be important to you. Call the guide(s) and ask questions to determine if there is compatibility.</li>
    <li>
<strong>Agree on fees in advance</strong>. This works both ways. You certainly don’t want to be charged for items that you thought were included. On the other hand, it is unfair to ask a guide to include sites that were never agreed to, or to show up with six extra cousins for the same fee. Be clear about what you expect him/her to do.</li>
    <li>
<strong>Discuss physical limitations</strong>. Many sites are difficult to traverse due to uneven paving. Other sites require fairly long walks to access. Bazaars and markets can be a challenge,too.</li>
    <li>
<strong>Agree to your itinerary</strong>. Be specific, but allow for those “I’ve got to stop for that image” opportunities.</li>
    <li>
<strong>Be astute.</strong> The first few days will be a mutual learning experience as you adapt to each other’s pace and modus operandi. Dole out responsibilities reasonably. I met a senior woman in Sri Lanka on my recent trip there who had hired a guide in India to porter her gear. He commented on how much nice equipment she had. When they got to a temple in India, he suggested she go in, take her time and photograph, while he watched her pack. She left her good gear and took a simple point-and-shoot with her. When she came back out, he was nowhere to be found!One solution to this, of course, is to check references or hire your guide through a reputable agency (usually at twice the going rate). Another option is to ask the guide for his driver’s license or government identification card and get a photocopy of these items.</li>
</ol>

		  <div class="entry-content"><p><em><strong>Please Note</strong></em>: We have decided to extend the bird photography contest deadline by one month to <strong>January 23, 2013</strong>. We received several slaps up side-the-head from potential entrants reminding us that the holiday season is no time to detract people from their primary spiritual goal of spending money on worthless stuff (meaning anything not photography-related).  So, please spread the word that the contest is still open. To better understand the prizes, please visit our <a href="http://www.lesterpickerphoto.com">revised website</a>.</p>

<p>First, some random musings regarding bird photography, prompted by  something I read recently about one of my mentors, the incomparable Roger Tory Peterson, who died in 1996. My younger readers may not even know the name, more&#8217;s the pity, but anyone over 40 who was even remotely involved in nature pursuits will undoubtedly recognize the name, if only from his signature Peterson Nature Guides.</p>

<p>I&#8217;ll start off by saying that I tip my hat to all bird photographers. You folks are out there at all hours of the day, but especially at sunrise, attempting to shoot nervous little critters that just will not sit still. They flit, they fret, they fly up, down and sideways. It&#8217;s winged ADHD.</p>

<p>It&#8217;s odd that I never got into bird photography in any major way, especially due to the influence that Roger Peterson had on my life. When I was doing my ecology graduate work at the University of Maine, I approached Roger, arguably the preeminent popular ornithologist of his time, author and artist, for help. I had met Roger when I interviewed him for a biology publication and afterwards he graciously took on this young, eager ecologist as a student of sorts. I remember sitting in his windowed Connecticut studio, surrounded by his lovely artwork, pestering him with questions and listening to his suggestions for my research.</p>

<p><a href="http://blog.lesterpickerphoto.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/12/DSC4098-1.jpg"><img class="alignnone size-medium wp-image-2482" title="_DSC4098 (1)" src="http://blog.lesterpickerphoto.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/12/DSC4098-1-200x300.jpg" alt="" width="200" height="300"></a></p>

<p>But, while I marveled at Roger&#8217;s deep knowledge and his love of nature, I have never been drawn to bird photography in any serious way. Sure, I&#8217;ve captured some decent photos of my feathered friends from time to time, but I&#8217;ve never mastered its art. I do, however, acknowledge those photographers who have.</p>

<p><a href="http://blog.lesterpickerphoto.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/12/LAP67771.jpg"><img class="alignnone size-medium wp-image-2485" title="_LAP6777" src="http://blog.lesterpickerphoto.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/12/LAP67771-300x225.jpg" alt="" width="300" height="225"></a></p>

		  <div class="entry-content"><p>To paraphrase, if you eat sausage, you don&#8217;t want to see how it&#8217;s made. In a similar vein, I thought I&#8217;d show you how a product shoot is staged, for better or worse. If you have a queasy stomach, look away.</p>

<p>For our revised website, which premiers in a couple of weeks, we needed to show potential clients how our Portfolio boxes look. Here is one of the results of that shoot.</p>

<p><a href="http://blog.lesterpickerphoto.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/11/DSCF4711.jpg"><img class="size-medium wp-image-2476" title="DSCF4711" src="http://blog.lesterpickerphoto.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/11/DSCF4711-300x199.jpg" alt="" width="300" height="199"></a></p>

<p> </p>

<p>Having been commissioned to produce 30 of these boxes for one client recently, we decided to set up shop in the upstairs of my home. We chose that spot because it is well lit and would not need extra light stands, flashes, diffusers and other paraphernalia of the product-shot trade. There are times when we have to resort to elaborate setups, but in this case we felt that we could get reasonable images without so much fuss. It was worth a try at least.</p>

<p>After umpteen trips upstairs with the goods, we finally dragged up the cameras and got to work. Normally we would lay out fancy materials or backdrops but, again, we wanted simplicity. We also knew that we would be shooting tight, making elaborate props unnecessary.</p>

<p>Bob took this shot of me at work with my Hasselblad H4D-50 and 50-110mm lens. Bob shot his images on his Fuji x100, hand-held (pretty impressive little camera&#8230; in the hands of a pro).</p>

<p><a href="http://blog.lesterpickerphoto.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/11/DSCF4721.jpg"><img class="size-medium wp-image-2477" title="DSCF4721" src="http://blog.lesterpickerphoto.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/11/DSCF4721-300x199.jpg" alt="" width="300" height="199"></a></p>

<p> </p>

<p>My point in sharing this with you is that with today&#8217;s digital cameras, you really don&#8217;t need a lot of other fancy stuff to get solid images that meet your needs. If you shoot in RAW, you can change the white balance to achieve the color balance you want, from cool to warm. You can crop, burn, dodge, globally adjust and fine tune. In fact, if there are indoor projects you&#8217;ve been wanting to do, winter is the perfect time to check them off your to-do list.</p>

<hr />

<p>As an American, I know just how fortunate we are to live in such variegated landscapes, rich in water and woods, mountains and prairies, and blessed with the mineral wealth we need for life and commerce. I have spent the better part of my life documenting its majesty both in writing and images.</p>

<p>But I have come to know that there is a secret, magical land sitting on top of us. Well, north of us anyway. With a far greater land mass than we enjoy here in the United States and with one-tenth the number of people, much of Canada appears to us landscape photographers exactly as it did to First Nation people, Canadian trappers and pioneers hundreds of years ago. Take Canada’s Yukon Territory, for example. With a land area some 20% larger than California, it has only 30,000 residents, compared to California’s 33 million. With about 30,000 bears, 60,000 moose and 250,000 caribou, plus elk, fox and eagles, it is also a wildlife photographer’s paradise.</p>

<p>One of the things I love about Canada is that, as a landscape artist, I don’t have to battle crowds to record the images I visualize. I can take my time surveying the area for the best vantage points, set up my tripod, and shoot, reposition and shoot again. Some of the images, in fact, took multiple visits before I was happy with the results.</p>

<p>Each image in this <em>Folio Collection</em> was individually prepared for printing and then hand-printed on Museo Silver Rag archival, museum-quality, fine art paper (300gsm). Prints will last at least 100 years if they are properly cared for. To that end, please store them in the Folio at room temperatures.</p>

<p>The landscapes in this <em>Folio Collection</em> were recorded between 2007 and 2011 using digital capture on Nikon and Hasselblad professional equipment.</p>

<p>Periodically I issue other hand-printed <em>Folio Collections</em>. Please check back from time to time for new releases. If you are interested in purchasing this <em>Folio Collection</em> please click <a href="http://shop.lesterpickerphoto.com/page/201">here</a>.</p>

<hr />

<p>As an American, I know just how fortunate we are to live in such variegated landscapes, rich in water and woods, mountains and prairies, and blessed with the mineral wealth we need for life and commerce. I have spent the better part of my life documenting its majesty both in writing and images.</p>

<p>But I have come to know that there is a secret, magical land sitting on top of us. Well, north of us anyway. With a far greater land mass than we enjoy here in the United States and with one-tenth the number of people, much of Canada appears to us landscape photographers exactly as it did to First Nation people, Canadian trappers and pioneers hundreds of years ago. Take Canada’s Yukon Territory, for example. With a land area some 20% larger than California, it has only 30,000 residents, compared to California’s 33 million. With about 30,000 bears, 60,000 moose and 250,000 caribou, plus elk, fox and eagles, it is also a wildlife photographer’s paradise.</p>

<p>One of the things I love about Canada is that, as a landscape artist, I don’t have to battle crowds to record the images I visualize. I can take my time to survey the area for the best vantage points, set up my tripod (all the images in this folio were taken tripod-mounted), and shoot, reposition and shoot again. Some of the images, in fact, took multiple visits before I was happy with the results.</p>

		  <div class="entry-content"><p>To paraphrase the famous Shaker song, simplicity is a virtue. I&#8217;ll add my voice to that song any day when it comes to photography.</p>

<p>What I mean by that is what I often refer to as &#8216;essence.&#8217; I&#8217;ve addressed this issue recently in a blog I called &#8221;<a href="http://blog.lesterpickerphoto.com/2012/11/08/finding-the-essence/">Finding the Essence</a>.&#8221; I&#8217;d like to take that a step further in this blog. When we are out in the field and observe a landscape that we want to photograph, we are often swamped by the sheer detail in the scene. Landscapes, after all, are typically complex scenes. There are trees, rocks, clouds, mountains and water, often in the same scene! How do we convey a story, the story we want to tell, in such a jumble of concepts?</p>

<p>I often urge my students to think in terms of what is the story that you are trying to tell? Can you reduce it to a single concept? If so, how can you manipulate the scene to emphasize that story line? Can you crop out the extraneous, distracting elements? Can you move the focal point to better tell the story or emphasize one detail over another?</p>

<p>Going one step further is the long-revered concept in photography known as minimalism. How can you tell that very same story by reducing the elements in your photo to the very basics. And here is where I&#8217;d like to introduce you to one of the photographers who recently took my Acadia National Park workshop.</p>

<p>His name is Lew Rothman, and he is a retired radiologist from the Big Apple. Lew is in some respects from the old school of photography. He is deliberate in his approach to a shot. He does not lean on the shutter release button to record 25 images and hope one is right. On this particular day, we had just completed a sunrise shoot at Sand Beach. As we traveled the famed Ocean Drive, we stopped here and there for photo shoots. On one of our stops, Lew managed this image:</p>

<p><a href="http://blog.lesterpickerphoto.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/11/O6C6835_HDR.jpg"><img class="alignnone size-medium wp-image-2464" title="_O6C6835_HDR" src="http://blog.lesterpickerphoto.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/11/O6C6835_HDR-300x199.jpg" alt="" width="300" height="199"></a></p>

<p> </p>

<p>I&#8217;ll let Lew take over from here with his explanation:</p>

<p>&#8220;Although I had set out for a colorful sunrise, the dawn light and mysterious cloud cover seemed to call for a black and white interpretation of the cliffs and bay at Acadia National Park that morning. The lone denuded tree provided a strong vertical foreground visual element to contrast with the planar configuration of the rocks, sea and sky. My most successful compositions tend to be uncluttered and geometric in nature and this seemed to fit that objective. The image was executed as an HDR capture with 7 bracketed exposures, each varied by 1½ stops and first processed in NIK HDR Efex Pro2 and then converted to Black and white in NIK Silver Efex Pro2. Enclosed is a single mid exposure, the color HDR rendering as well as the final B&amp;W. Camera Canon 5D MK3, ISO 100, 24-105 mm F4.0 lens @35mm, mid exposure f 8 @1/80 sec.&#8221;</p>

<p>In my opinion, the lightbulb came on when Lew felt that the shot rendered better in B&amp;W.</p>

<p><a href="http://blog.lesterpickerphoto.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/11/O6C6835_HDR-Edit.jpg"><img class="alignnone size-medium wp-image-2465" title="_O6C6835_HDR-Edit" src="http://blog.lesterpickerphoto.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/11/O6C6835_HDR-Edit-300x199.jpg" alt="" width="300" height="199"></a></p>

<p> </p>

<p>I fully agree with his decision, and I think that is true because of the &#8216;essence&#8217; and minimalism concepts. Here we have the four basic elements of nature: sky, water, tree and earth. Lew was able to focus the reader&#8217;s attention on that and that alone. It is what I might call elemental. That minimalism helps the image. I think that the way he placed the tree using the Rule of Thirds helps, as does the way he rendered the clouds. Despite unfavorable weather conditions, Lew was able to extract a wonderful image from the outing. His use of HDR is restrained, which I feel also helps make the image.</p>

<p>Thanks to Lew for allowing me to share his work with my readers.</p>

<hr />

<p>Pasteur said that chance favors the prepared mind. I would say the same about capturing landscape images. I know that the more prepared I am for an assignment, the better the images tend to be.</p>

<p>My wife was assisting me on an assignment to Canada&#8217;s Yukon Territory, a pure-and-simple magical land that I visit whenever I can. We had driven by RV nearly its entire length, from Whitehorse in the south, past the Arctic Circle in the north. I love stopping at Tombstone Valley because it is a landscape artist&#8217;s dream spot. It changes every season, every day, every hour and, as I learned here, every minute.</p>

<p>The day was threatening throughout and by mid-day the temps had dropped significantly, even though it was only late August. I thought it might be fruitless to stop for a shoot, but then I reconsidered, made a U-turn (try that in an RV!) and pulled into the overlook. There were only a few tourists watching the brewing storm. As I set up my tripod and camera, the storm clouds became more pronounced and the winds kicked up to near gale force. Everyone ran for their vehicles and got out of there in a hurry.</p>

<p>The winds were so fierce I had to brace my tripod by hanging my 30-pound backpack from the center hook. And then it happened. For the briefest of seconds the sun burst through the clouds. Snap, snap, snap and it was over! With my wife screaming for me to get my butt back into the RV, I ran for safety, just as the graying skies began dumping their white, fluffy load. We had to buck the winds to get to a secure campsite a few miles down the road, but I smiled all the way.</p>

<p>Not too many places on this planet can surpass the Canadian Rockies for a wildlife or landscape photographer. Majestic mountains, pristine lakes, moss-lined brooks, bear, moose, wolves…</p>

<p>I love the Rockies the most at sunrise, when I can witness the natural world coming alive. I arrive, headlamp leading me to the spot I have usually cased out the day before. I set up as the sun begins to announce its presence by lighting the sky just a tad. All is still, birds nervously await the sun&#8217;s warm rays and then, miraculously, the sun crests a nearby mountain and sprays of alpenglow ignite the peaks. The still waters reflect the mountains and meadows and sky.</p>

<p>All is well. It is the start of another Fall day on Rampart Pond.</p>

		  <div class="entry-content"><p>This blog has nothing to do with photography. It has much to do with life. As we travel our individual path, we are sometimes- rarely- fortunate enough to meet up with a person whose very presence can change you in deep and meaningful ways. Such a person in my life is Barbara Higgins, known as Xwu&#8217;p&#8217;a&#8217;lich to her fellow tribal members.</p>

<p><a href="http://blog.lesterpickerphoto.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/11/IMG_0388.jpg"><img class="size-medium wp-image-2454 " title="IMG_0388" src="http://blog.lesterpickerphoto.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/11/IMG_0388-225x300.jpg" alt="" width="225" height="300"></a></p>

<p>Barb is an elder and a revered traditional healer and medicine woman for her Coast Salish First Nation&#8217;s tribe on Canada&#8217;s Sunshine Coast. I could sing her praises for this entire blog, but that&#8217;s not my purpose. Suffice it to say that she is wise beyond her years and, my guess is, she has been that way for her entire life.</p>

<p>I have been fortunate to sit in her living room, travel with her, canoe with her, sing and drum with her. I have attended the all-day coming of age ceremony for her grandson, Robert. I have witnessed her, her daughter Holly, and Robert singing and drumming on a Sunshine Coast beach as their spirits connected with a gray whale and slowly brought it ever closer to us. My wife, our granddaughter and I stood in watching in amazement, until it was but 50 yards offshore, its vaporous breath resonating in our ears. But, most all, what I love about Barb is her story-telling. People sit around the proverbial (and sometimes virtual) fire pit, spellbound, as she weaves her tales, usually from childhood recollections.</p>

<p>That is why I was excited to get a note from Barb, telling me that one of her stories had been accepted for David Suzuki&#8217;s website. If you have 15 minutes I suggest you get yourself a cup of coffee, sit back and enjoy <a href="http://www.davidsuzuki.org/issues/oceans/projects/healthy-oceans/pacific-ocean-stories/fishing-for-octopus/">the world that Barb creates with her story</a>. And perhaps I was wrong about this having nothing to do with photography. In the end we are both storytellers. Only Barb&#8217;s stories you can almost hear, feel, taste and touch. Let her transport you to a different time and a different world, to a time in her youth when she battled a giant octopus near Skookumchuk Rapids on the coast of British Columbia in 1943. When you&#8217;re done, please let me know what you think by commenting below.</p>

		  <div class="entry-content"><p>It&#8217;s rarely that I come across a truly wonderful blog, one I cannot wait to share. But just yesterday my colleague Dan Stainer, an advanced amateur who could go pro whenever he wanted, sent me a link to his latest blog and I was impressed. Again.</p>

<p>In the way of background, Dan was honored by being selected for the Missouri Photography Workshop, where a group of skilled craftspeople share a week under the tutelage of some of the best photographers in the country. Each has to complete a photojournalism story while having their work critiqued at every twist and turn. Talking about pressure!</p>

<p><a href="http://blog.lesterpickerphoto.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/11/i-jX3HqBK-S.jpg"><img class="size-medium wp-image-2445" title="i-jX3HqBK-S" src="http://blog.lesterpickerphoto.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/11/i-jX3HqBK-S-300x200.jpg" alt="" width="300" height="200"></a></p>

<p>Dan did a credible job during his stay. But what I think makes his blog so good is its humanity. Dan shares with us his fears and self-doubt, the same ones we all face when we embark on a new assignment. I don&#8217;t want to give away too much. I urge you to <a href="http://danielstainer.wordpress.com/2012/11/03/missouri-photo-workshop-an-experience-that-lasts-a-lifetime/">visit his post</a> and enjoy it.</p>

		  <div class="entry-content"><p>I frequently lecture about the importance of finding the &#8220;essence&#8221; in one&#8217;s images. By essence I mean the conscious effort to reduce the image to its defining characteristics, its purest storyline minus unnecessary distractions. It is a concept that invariably leads to a more focused image, to one that is more dramatic and appealing to the viewer.</p>

<p>One of the participants in my recent Acadia National Park (Maine) workshop for Nikonians sent me a good working example of the concept. We were shooting at the picturesque fishing village of Bass Harbor, when David Soderlund came across this scene. I&#8217;ll let him tell it in his own words:</p>

<p><a href="http://blog.lesterpickerphoto.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/11/DMS-critique-image-original.jpg"><img class="size-medium wp-image-2439" title="DMS critique image original" src="http://blog.lesterpickerphoto.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/11/DMS-critique-image-original-300x199.jpg" alt="" width="300" height="199"></a></p>

<p>&#8220;At the end of our time in Bass Harbor I grabbed a shot of the pier.  When I looked at it critically more recently, I realized that it was really the two boats, plus the lines of the pier, that caught my eye, but the rest of the image was pretty boring.&#8221;</p>

<p>Not satisfied with the image once he saw it on his screen, Dave took some drastic action.</p>

<p>&#8220;I cropped the image severely in Aperture 3 (throwing away a lot of pixels) to emphasize the &#8220;essence&#8221; of the image — for me, it was the two boats — and I selectively desaturated yellow hues slightly in Aperture to tone down the yellow lobster traps on the dock.  I applied filters in NIK Color Efex Pro 4 to increase contrast and enhance the surface detail in the boats.  The boats are clearly working boats rather than pleasure craft, and I wanted to emphasize that.</p>

<p>&#8221; I also used NIK Viveza 2 to selectively increase saturation of the blue tones in the foreground boat and desaturate the distracting bright red and pink of the cluster of buoys on the dock in the background.  Finally, I used NIK Sharpener Pro 3 to apply default sharpening for computer display before exporting the image.  I like the final result, but I wish I had seen this composition when I was shooting it!&#8221;</p>

<p><a href="http://blog.lesterpickerphoto.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/11/DMS-critique-image-final.jpg"><img class="size-medium wp-image-2440" title="CEP4 multiple filtersV2 selectve saturation/desaturation" src="http://blog.lesterpickerphoto.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/11/DMS-critique-image-final-300x189.jpg" alt="" width="300" height="189"></a></p>

<p> </p>

<p>No matter. The beauty of digital is that you can come home from a shoot and then work your images to suit your unique creative vision. I like what Dave has done here. He has reduced the image to its pure storyline- working fishing boats at a working fishing pier. By removing the distractions he found the essence of the image. Yes, he would have had more pixels to work with had he not had to crop so severely. But his post-processing hand was deftly applied, too. Now he has a print-worthy image to frame. Congrats, Dave!</p>

<p>In my next blog I&#8217;ll take a look at another approach to essence photography, namely <em>minimalism</em>, using a classic example from another of my workshop participants. Stay tuned!</p>

		  <div class="entry-content"><p>Echoes of Earth</p>

<p>With the tail winds of Hurricane Sandy still buffeting our home last week, there was knock on the door and my mail carrier delivered a photography book that I had been looking forward to reviewing for my readers.</p>

<p>With a blanket wrapped around me for warmth, I settled down for a pleasant tour of some of the oldest rocks on our planet, which is the raison d&#8217;etre of writer-photographer L. Sue Baugh and her traveling companion, Lynn Martinelli. Over a period of ten years these two amazing women logged in 54,000 miles to visit and photograph these rock formations. The result is <em>Echoes of Earth</em> published by <a href="http://www.wildstonearts.com">Wild Stone arts</a> . Their incredible journey taught them some fascinating lessons about life itself.</p>

<p><a href="http://blog.lesterpickerphoto.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/11/eoe_coverb.jpg"><img class="alignnone size-medium wp-image-2436" title="eoe_coverb" src="http://blog.lesterpickerphoto.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/11/eoe_coverb-240x300.jpg" alt="" width="240" height="300"></a></p>

<p>The narrative is compelling, although at times too New Wave for my scientific training. For example, in a section on lichens, the author states: &#8220;As we move closer to each one, there&#8217;s a strange feeling of recognition, as if in some child-like way we know each other. Maybe the spirits are trying once again to give us knowledge.&#8221; Maybe. Yet one has to respect the awe these women experience when wandering these ancient rocky outcroppings.</p>

<p>In the chapter entitled &#8216;Strength Within our Bones,&#8217; the author explains how a fundamental mineral, apatite, formed some 4.5 billion years ago is critical to the strength and rigidity of our bones. Baugh extends that information into the chapter titled &#8216;Ancient Life Within Us,&#8217; which shows how the ancient minerals- all derivative of rocks- form the basis of our biology.</p>

<p>Yet, to be candid, the most surprising element of the book was the photography. Billed as having &#8220;breath-taking photographs,&#8221; I was sorely disappointed. Now I do not expect every coffee-table book to have stunning photography, but in a tome that boasts &#8220;over 200 spectacular photographs from three contents,&#8221; I expected far better images.</p>

<p>First, the images suffer from amateurish composition that make most of them dull and uninteresting. Second, the authors obviously confined their photography to mid-day hours almost exclusively, missing out on the lighting of &#8220;magic hours&#8221; which might have added some mood and drama. Third, most of the images are out of focus and far too many suffer from serious grain (all the photography was recorded on film). Finally, many of the images were overly enlarged, making them appear soft.</p>

<p>The publishers tried to add a few gimmicks, such as fold-out pages, fold-up pages, and circles and ovals cutouts. Unfortunately, due to the poor photography I do not feel they work.</p>

<p>One final point. It is not clear what role the second woman, Lynn Martinelli, has in the book&#8217;s production, other than accompanying Baugh. Did she write any of the text? Did she contribute to the photography? In the &#8220;About Us&#8221; section of <a href="http://www.wildstonearts.com">their website</a>, both women are profiled, yet the book only has Baugh&#8217;s name on the cover. In the FAQ section the text refers to &#8220;our photography.&#8221; As a reviewer I&#8217;m confused.</p>

<p>I wish I could have been floored by this book. But, for $40 I think photography readers would expect more.</p>

<p> </p>

<p>After 18 months of treatment for what we thought was simply plantar fasciitis turned out to actually be a fractured heel. It&#8217;s hard to be sure when it originally happened, but I&#8217;m certain it was hiking down some mountain path with 30 pounds of gear in my pack. As of today I am officially immobilized and in 6 weeks I look forward to hitting the trails again. In the meantime this baby cost me a trip to Africa. Damn!</p>

		  <div class="entry-content"><p>If you have been following my blog the past few days, you know I live at the water&#8217;s due and that we&#8217;ve been hunkered down for Sandy. We prepped for days, removing everything from our garage floor, stuffing towels in our sliding doors to soak up wind-driven rain and  even evacuating for a night when flooding threatened. Fortunately, we came through the storm with minimal damage and no flooding at all. But, as several of you have pointed out, that&#8217;s what it costs to live here.</p>

<p>And then this morning we awoke to a cloudy day, but no rain, and with low-lyig clouds clearly matching the bands of wind we saw on our weather radar screen. The geese sauntered back into our cove, people were out cleaning up from the storm damage, and by mid-afternoon we were treated to something special.</p>

<p><a href="http://blog.lesterpickerphoto.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/10/fox-on-rock.jpg"><img class="size-medium wp-image-2428" title="fox-on-rock" src="http://blog.lesterpickerphoto.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/10/fox-on-rock-300x200.jpg" alt="" width="300" height="200"></a></p>

<p> </p>

<p>Not 100 yards from my deck a red fox was asleep on a slab of cement (from a previous storm), obviously enjoying the break in the weather. We&#8217;ve seen this beauty on and off over the past few years. I figure his den was washed out and he relished his lustrous coat drying out. He slept for about 30 minutes and then awoke with a start and was gone.</p>

<p>It was a lesson of sorts. True, every so often we get inconvenienced by storms, but most of the time there are the glorious blessings. The cycle of the seasons, birds migrating to and from, beaver searching for their winter supply of leafy treats, carp rooting in the muddy bottom to lay their eggs, even people frolicking on the water. We get wet, we dry out, on with life. My thanks to my red furry friend.</p>

		  <div class="entry-content"><p>A great expression and one that sailors and those of us who live on the narrow margin of sea and land know well.</p>

<p>We returned to our home this morning and happily found that we were not flooded&#8230; yet. Roof tiles lay scattered on the ground, but the garage level was dry. And the house, which sits on pilings, is intact. Sighs of relief.</p>

<p>But it is now morning high tide as I write this. The back side of Hurricane Sandy is now churning the waters up our normally tranquil Chesapeake Bay, adding greatly to the tide&#8217;s height. The waters are lapping at the garage, but so far have not encroached. The biggest danger comes with tonight&#8217;s high tide. So we wait and keep watch.</p>

<p>This is a view directly across our tiny cove at two docks, or what used to be docks. Hard to say how they fared since they are both underwater. Time and tide will tell us at dawn tomorrow.</p>

		  <div class="entry-content"><p>As of 4:00 PM today we had to evacuate our home, one of the perils of living on the water&#8217;s edge. As it turns out our tiny, historic town of Havre de Grace, Maryland is directly in line of the worst of the storm (as of 6:30PM according to the New York Times). The winds here are already ferocious and are predicted to double as the center of the storm passes during the night.</p>

<p>My main concern at the moment is high tide, when the waters of the mighty, wind-whipped Susquehanna River meet the incoming tide running up the Chesapeake Bay. Unfortunately this time- but fortunately the other 99.99% of the time- we live at the confluence of both bodies of water. We expect to be flooded. Our hope is that it stays below 24&#8221; in our garage.</p>

<p>This is an iPhone image taken from my deck a couple of hours before we left and it doesn&#8217;t look too terribly bad.</p>

<p><a href="http://blog.lesterpickerphoto.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/10/storm.jpg"><img class="alignnone size-medium wp-image-2419" title="storm" src="http://blog.lesterpickerphoto.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/10/storm-300x225.jpg" alt="" width="300" height="225"></a></p>

<p>By now we envision roof tiles ripped off and the waters rising. Oh, well.</p>

<p>I&#8217;ll get some images when we return, hopefully to a nice, dry home! Stay posted.</p>

		  <div class="entry-content"><p>I&#8217;m here at PhotoPlus 2012 with Bob Boyer, my assistant, and so far we&#8217;re enjoying the immersion in all things photographic. The Javits Center in mid-town Manhattan is gigantic and it is currently filled with tens of thousands of photo enthusiasts from all over the country, weaving their way through the overwhelming maze of exhibitors.</p>

<p><a href="http://blog.lesterpickerphoto.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/10/javits-hall-photo.jpg"><img class="size-medium wp-image-2409" title="javits-hall-photo" src="http://blog.lesterpickerphoto.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/10/javits-hall-photo-300x225.jpg" alt="" width="300" height="225"></a></p>

<p>Today I spent most of my time talking with people who visited the Intelicoat Technologies, Inc. booth. I was one of the guest artists for their Museo Fine Art papers exhibit on the main floor of the gargantuan exhibition hall.</p>

<p><a href="http://blog.lesterpickerphoto.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/10/Museo-booth1.jpg"><img class="size-medium wp-image-2411" title="Museo-booth" src="http://blog.lesterpickerphoto.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/10/Museo-booth1-300x225.jpg" alt="" width="300" height="225"></a></p>

<p> </p>

<p>As I&#8217;ve said before, my assistant and Master Printer Bob Boyer and I simply love the luscious Museo papers. They have become the mainstay of our Limited Edition collections. We depend on their consistency, incredible D-MAX performance and tonal range to produce our large and small format prints.</p>

<p><a href="http://blog.lesterpickerphoto.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/10/bob-museo.jpg"><img class="size-medium wp-image-2412" title="bob-museo" src="http://blog.lesterpickerphoto.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/10/bob-museo-300x225.jpg" alt="" width="300" height="225"></a></p>

<p> </p>

<p>Tomorrow I&#8217;ll share with you some of the neat photo gadgets, gizmos and geeky gifts I saw at PhotoPlus. Please visit my blog then and you&#8217;ll be set for Christmas and Hanukkah.</p>

<p> </p>

<p>P)LEASE NOTE: Sorry folks, but I arrived home to preparations for Hurricane Sandy. We live on the Chesapeake Bay in Maryland and we may have to evacuate, so stay tuned for details on PhotoPlus (and how we weathered the hurricane).</p>

		  <div class="entry-content"><p>Bob and I are off to the <a href="http://www.photoplusexpo.com">PhotoPlus</a> Expo in New York City. PhotoPlus is the largest photo convention in the country, drawing tens of thousands of avid photographers. The convention hall is filled with amateurs and pros checking out the hundreds of exhibitors and brushing up on new products and techniques.</p>

<p><a href="http://blog.lesterpickerphoto.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/10/display.php_.jpeg"><img class="alignnone size-medium wp-image-2404" title="display.php" src="http://blog.lesterpickerphoto.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/10/display.php_-300x115.jpeg" alt="" width="300" height="115"></a></p>

<p>There are demonstrations, lectures, one-on-one consultations and critiques. The atmosphere is fairly electric. Even if you spent every moment of the three days exploring the vendors, you&#8217;d be hard pressed to cover them all. Cameras, lenses, printers, gadget bags, lighting products, and photo papers.</p>

<p>The latter is what is drawing us this year. Partnering with <a href="http://www.museofineart.com">Museo Digital Fine Art Media</a>, a division of Intelicoat Technologies, our photographic artwork is being featured in their exhibit. Bob is the Master Printer who brings my landscapes, wildlife and custom photography to life. We printed a series of my images on Museo&#8217;s Silver Rag and Max paper for their New York exhibit. During the Expo I&#8217;ll be photographing with my iPhone and posting updates on new equipment, techniques, and interesting people.</p>

<p> </p>

<p><a href="http://blog.lesterpickerphoto.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/10/fc44ffba685c2f00b6ab547fa5d201f4.png"><img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-2405" title="fc44ffba685c2f00b6ab547fa5d201f4" src="http://blog.lesterpickerphoto.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/10/fc44ffba685c2f00b6ab547fa5d201f4.png" alt="" width="200" height="47"></a></p>

<p>The interesting thing about our association with Museo is that we have always loved their papers. They are luscious, gorgeous, consistent- whatever adjective you&#8217;d want to associate with the best fine art photo papers. And their D-Max is unbeatable. If you are planning to attend PhotoPlus, please stop by Museo&#8217;s booth to learn about their products and say hi.</p>

		  <div class="entry-content"><p>It&#8217;s the end of another spectacular Fall Maine Nikonians workshop. Frankly, I&#8217;m sorry to see it end. Coastal Maine in the Fall is a joy that every landscape and travel photographer should experience. There are, of course, the quintessential rocky coast images to be captured, but there are also the birch forests, tree-lined ponds, bogs, waterfalls, lighthouses, and thick-cushioned, undulating moss that fluoresces in the rain or fog. There are quiet, picturesque villages like Somesville, and hard working lobstermen and women in their colorful boats in towns like Southwest Harbor, Bass Harbor or Bernard.</p>

<p><a href="http://blog.lesterpickerphoto.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/10/monument-cove.jpg"><img class="size-medium wp-image-2397" title="monument cove" src="http://blog.lesterpickerphoto.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/10/monument-cove-300x225.jpg" alt="" width="300" height="225"></a></p>

<p>I&#8217;ve often said that Mt. Desert Island, where the epicenter of Acadia National Park is located, has more photo opps per square meter than any other place on earth. Drop a pin anywhere in Acadia and if you can&#8217;t spend the rest of the day photographing within 100 yards of that pin, call your optometrist.</p>

<p>This year&#8217;s workshop was fully subscribed, although a few days before we began one of the participants had to drop out due to a family emergency. I like to limit my workshops to ten or fewer people, depending on the location, so each participant can feel comfortable asking me for help or advice.</p>

<p>This year our group gelled from the moment we met. Coming from as far away as Texas, we shared, critiqued, laughed and shot sunrises, sunsets and all sorts of scenics in between. We even elected to have dinner together each night, sharing our daily adventures over good food, micro-brew beers and good wines.</p>

<p><a href="http://blog.lesterpickerphoto.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/10/workshop-discussion.jpg"><img class="size-medium wp-image-2401" title="workshop-discussion" src="http://blog.lesterpickerphoto.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/10/workshop-discussion-300x225.jpg" alt="" width="300" height="225"></a></p>

<p>When all is said and done I want to tip my hat to my workshoppers. Not only did I enjoy their company, but I learned some things myself. I was so impressed by the positive attitude, the collegiality, and the dedication these folks exhibited to their avocation. They are a passionate group, eager to learn and use new skills to improve their self-expression through photography. I made nine wonderful friends over the past four days. Hats off to you fine folks!</p>

<p>Next year&#8217;s workshops in Acadia will be posted soon on the <a href="http://www.nikoniansacademy.com/all/viewWorkshop.html?workshop_id=107">Nikonians website</a>. Check there for details.</p>

		  <div class="entry-content"><p>This morning my Maine photo workshop group that I teach for Nikonians woke up to torrential rains. So our morning field trip was cancelled and instead we had a wonderful 3-hour discussion session, covering lots of photographic concepts.</p>

<p><a href="http://blog.lesterpickerphoto.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/10/image.jpeg"><img class="size-medium wp-image-2393" title="image" src="http://blog.lesterpickerphoto.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/10/image-300x225.jpeg" alt="" width="300" height="225"></a></p>

<p>Personally, I love these jam sessions, with no preconceived agenda. Instead, having lived with each other for 36 hours already, shooting all around spectacular Mt. Desert Island, questions have arisen, new types of equipment seen, new techniques observed. So the morning was spent sharing with each other terrific photo tips and suggestions.</p>

<p>I particularly enjoy these sessions because I learn so much from these passionate, committed folks. Today I found out about some new software, and picked up a tripod tip, for example. Judging from the reaction of the participants, I think they appreciated the down down, the sharing, and the chance to pick up tips from a working pro.</p>

<p>Now I&#8217;m busily scarfing down some lunch because the rain is easing and we&#8217;re out to photograph an eye candy moss forest and then hike to a waterfall.</p>

		  <div class="entry-content"><p>My 2012 Maine photography workshop has just begun and already we are being treated to Mother Nature&#8217;s Fall Spectacular. Since I got up for a sunrise shoot and it&#8217;s not almost 11:00PM and I have another sunrise shoot tomorrow, this will have to be short.</p>

<p><a href="http://blog.lesterpickerphoto.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/10/A0022832.jpg"><img class="size-medium wp-image-2389" title="A0022832" src="http://blog.lesterpickerphoto.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/10/A0022832-300x225.jpg" alt="" width="300" height="225"></a></p>

<p> </p>

<p>My wife and I were driving past North East Harbor on Mt. Desert Island, doing a last minute check on sites where I plan on taking my workshop participants, when the pond scene at the Asticou Azalea Gardens reached out and grabbed us. This is an unretouched photo straight out of my camera (Hasselblad H4D-50).</p>

<p>I also scouted out the iconic Bass Harbor Light last night and here&#8217;s what I walked away with. There were probably a dozen other photographers scoping out the historic lighthouse and we had lots of laughs as the cameras whirred into motion.</p>

<p><a href="http://blog.lesterpickerphoto.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/10/A0022773.jpg"><img class="size-medium wp-image-2390" title="A0022773" src="http://blog.lesterpickerphoto.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/10/A0022773-225x300.jpg" alt="" width="225" height="300"></a></p>

<p>My workshop participants arrived just before dinner and we scurried over to Jordan Pond for a quick shoot Tomorrow is a big day, starting with sunrise at Sand Beach in Acadia National Park. I&#8217;ll keep you posted as the next four days go by.</p>

		  <div class="entry-content"><p>One could make a strong case for my professional schizophrenia. On the one hand I am a professional landscape/nature photographer. But that&#8217;s only half of what I do. I&#8217;ve also <a href="http://blog.lesterpickerphoto.com/about-2/">written nonfiction</a> extensively, for dozens of national magazines and newspapers over the years. Yet, one of my lifelong goals has been to write fiction.</p>

<p>So, play the fanfare. I&#8217;m excited to tell you all that this past week I published two of the historical fiction novels that I have been working on for the past several years. With the collapse of the tree-killing publishers over the past few years, my literary agent and I decided that the best approach right now is for me to publish these first two books as e-books and also make them available as paperbacks through <a href="http://www.amazon.com/Lester-Picker/e/B009E6U9R0/ref=sr_tc_2_0?qid=1348945748&amp;sr=1-2-ent://">Amazon</a>.</p>

<p><a href="http://blog.lesterpickerphoto.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/10/The-First-Pharaoh-Ebook.jpg"><img class="alignnone size-medium wp-image-2380" title="The First Pharaoh Ebook" src="http://blog.lesterpickerphoto.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/10/The-First-Pharaoh-Ebook-192x300.jpg" alt="" width="192" height="300"></a></p>

<p>The lead book in my First Dynasty Series is called <em>The First Pharaoh</em>. It tells the story of King Narmer, who united Upper and Lower Egypt under one rule and created an enduring civilization that lasted for 3,000 years. The book is told through the eyes of Anhotek, King Narmer&#8217;s vizier and shaman. We follow Narmer&#8217;s birth, his loves, the battles he fought to unite Egypt, and the intrigue surrounding his enemies within the Royal Court.</p>

<p><a href="http://blog.lesterpickerphoto.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/10/The-Dagger-of-Isis-EBook-HR.jpg"><img class="alignnone size-medium wp-image-2381" title="The Dagger of Isis EBook HR" src="http://blog.lesterpickerphoto.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/10/The-Dagger-of-Isis-EBook-HR-192x300.jpg" alt="" width="192" height="300"></a></p>

<p>The sequel, <em>The Dagger of Isis</em>, tells what could arguably be called an even more amazing story; the rise to power of the very first female King, Narmer&#8217;s great-granddaughter. After the tragic death of her husband, Meryt-Neith overcomes the schemes of her cousin to lead the nation as regent for her son. The real-life Meryt-Neith ruled for 17 years, and my novel follows her rise to power, the wars she fought, as well as her struggles to maintain the fragile peace.</p>

<p>The third and final book in the series will be published in 2013. If I tell you what it is about I&#8217;ll have to send an undercover Apep priest to cast evil spells on you.</p>

		  <div class="entry-content"><p>For that one very special person who has time available, one slot has opened for my previously fully-booked photography workshop in Maine. The 4-day event begins on October 18 at 3:00 PM and ends on October 22 at noon. If there is any one place I look forward to being it is in Maine during Mother Nature&#8217;s display of Fall foliage. Even better, the workshop takes place in Acadia National Park, right on the coast. Acadia is a jewel, no doubt about that.</p>

<p><a href="http://blog.lesterpickerphoto.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/10/LAP8318.jpg"><img src="http://blog.lesterpickerphoto.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/10/LAP8318-300x199.jpg" alt="" title="_LAP8318" width="300" height="199" class="alignnone size-medium wp-image-2374"></a></p>

<p>We will spend four intense days shooting from sunrise to sunset, including forest, rocky coast, beach and mountain. This Nikonians workshop is open to anyone, regardless of ability level, camera, or knowledge. Come to learn! Come to share! Come to experience!</p>

		  <div class="entry-content"><p>Whether you&#8217;re a professional or amateur photographer, you should consider what your &#8220;brand&#8221; is all about. How do you want your audience to view you and your work? What image are you trying to project? Think hard about this branding stuff because it is critical for your success.</p>

<p>As a professional myself, my assistant and I have long discussions (and even arguments) when it comes to branding our work. Both of us are perfectionists when it comes to how my images look. But what I think largely sets us apart from our competition is that we give the same attention to how we present our work as I do in capturing every image.</p>

<p>I readily admit that I am blessed with an assistant as smart, diligent and experienced as Bob (Boyer). The fact that we both care about our &#8220;brand&#8221; is a bonus. If there is a flaw in one of our images, it does not leave our shop. Period.</p>

<p>But branding goes much farther than that for us. We are a high-end photographic business. I do editorial photography, but my work also hangs in major hospitals, offices, private homes and, occasionally, galleries. I want to be sure that everything that showcases my work is as thoughtfully done as the images themselves. We agonize over traditional framing options. Our face-mounted plexi images use nothing but the very best green-edged treatments and we add an architectural element to the mounting. We custom print our wall coverings ourselves in our shop so that they meet our exacting standards.</p>

<h3>Crazy Branding</h3>


<p>One recent example of how crazy this branding can get involves a gallery show that we did a few months ago, for which we printed several of my Limited Edition prints. These 30&#8221; x 40&#8221; prints, whether framed for unframed, are a significant investment, so we had long discussions over a seemingly petty thing like the Certificate of Authenticity (COA) that is transferred to the collector with the sale.</p>

<p>Most photographers have fairly large print runs for their Limited Edition images, perhaps 50, 100 or more and there is nothing wrong with that business model. For our part, we only do print runs of 10 or 25 (inclusive of all sizes). We believe that adds value to my art images, which are usually printed on Museo archival art papers in our studio, using our Epson 9900 with HDR UltraChrome Inks. So, these luscious prints are made to last 100 or more years.</p>

<p>Most COAs- and I have to be blunt here- look like they were created by 5th graders. Busy photographers simply pluck them off the Internet, maybe tinker with it a bit to personalize it, and then print it out and sign it. That flew in the face of our branding. We wanted our COA to perfectly match the high-end nature of our Limited Editions.</p>

<p>We went into design mode and over a period of two weeks we fidgeted and fussed until we had achieved what we were looking for. Our COA is not only &#8220;smart-looking&#8221; (a client&#8217;s words), but functional. It has three different security features that truly guarantee authenticity and would be very hard to forge (although no one in his right mind would attempt to forge my crappy signature!).</p>

<p><a href="http://blog.lesterpickerphoto.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/09/DSC_3582.jpeg"><img class="size-medium wp-image-2370" title="DSC_3582" src="http://blog.lesterpickerphoto.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/09/DSC_3582-300x200.jpeg" alt="" width="300" height="200"></a></p>

<p>Our COA is printed on top-end vellum paper. It includes a matching image, a description of the image and a brief on the paper and ink. The number of prints in the series is lightly screened across the bottom of the page. Our company logo is printed in two colors, and on the reverse side is a black security stripe that indicates the number of the print in the series. The final touch is a security holographic stamp over which I sign my name.</p>

<p>Over the top? Perhaps. But then again, that is what we want our clients to experience with each of our products. That&#8217;s our brand.</p>

		  <div class="entry-content"><p>So, it&#8217;s been about a week since my last post, a bit unusual for me. As you&#8217;ll see, I&#8217;ve been more than a bit busy as we prepare for the grand opening of the Neurological Rehabilitation Center at Sinai Hospital in Baltimore. My imagery is featured exclusively throughout the unit. That&#8217;s no small matter when we&#8217;re talking more than 50 images, some as much as 30 feet in width!</p>

<p>About ten days ago my installers put up all the wall covering images.</p>

<p><a href="http://blog.lesterpickerphoto.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/09/DSCF4507.jpg"><img src="http://blog.lesterpickerphoto.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/09/DSCF4507-300x199.jpg" alt="" title="DSCF4507" width="300" height="199" class="size-medium wp-image-2366"></a></p>

<p>I thought it would be fun to show you the main graphic going up. My assistant, Bob, compressed about two hours of work into <a title="Hanging Wall Covering" href="http://vimeo.com/49613056">one 60-second video</a> that we filmed (can we say that with video?) using my Nikon D800 and Bob&#8217;s Nikon D7000, both mounted on tripods.</p>

<p>It was a stressful day, with having to hang a 30-feet, 19-feet, 17-feet and assorted 10-feet and 4-feet walls. But our installers are super-pros and did a great job. Hats off to Robin, Sean and Bill!</p>

<p> </p>

For those of you who are curious, here is the file from which we created the wall covering.</p>

<p><a href="http://blog.lesterpickerphoto.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/09/harbor-flat-small1.jpg"><img class="size-medium wp-image-2360" title="Baltimore harbor" src="http://blog.lesterpickerphoto.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/09/harbor-flat-small1-300x89.jpg" alt="" width="300" height="89"></a></p>

<p>In the video you may notice that one of the panels is a bit &#8220;off&#8221; in terms of color and shading. We ended up having to rush back to our studio late at night, reprint the 9-foot strip, coat it with sealer, and have it back bright and early the next morning for our people to install it. Stuff happens!</p>

<p>BTW, I took this pano using 11 or so images across the bottom and the same number along the top, with my Nikon D800 and a 200-400mm lens set at 300mm. For details on how I shoot these panos, <a title="Panoramas: Part 2" href="http://blog.lesterpickerphoto.com/2012/09/02/panoramas-part-2-how-i-do-it/">check here</a> and <a title="Panoramas: Part 1" href="http://blog.lesterpickerphoto.com/2012/08/21/panoramas-nail-your-nodal-points/">here</a>.</p>

		  <div class="entry-content"><p>In <a href="http://blog.lesterpickerphoto.com/2012/08/21/panoramas-nail-your-nodal-points/">Part 1</a> of this 2-part series on panoramas, I discussed the role of nodal points in nailing top-notch panoramas. For a long time I didn&#8217;t bother with nodal points and that caused me a lot of extra post-processing time. In fact, on several occasions it meant that I had to throw out a pano that I had painstakingly tried to capture. That can easily happen if you do a pano with a looming foreground object and have not set your nodal point.</p>

<p>So, with my nodal points now set and printed on a card that I laminate and take with me, I&#8217;m off to the races.</p>

<p><a href="http://blog.lesterpickerphoto.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/09/nodalcard.jpg"><img class="size-medium wp-image-2340" title="nodalcard" src="http://blog.lesterpickerphoto.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/09/nodalcard-300x225.jpg" alt="" width="300" height="225"></a></p>

<p> </p>

<h3>The Setup</h3>


<p>When I&#8217;m on site I get out all my gear and set up. If I&#8217;m shooting a horizontal scene, I put my camera in vertical orientation. Vice versa if I plan to shoot a tall waterfall or vertical cityscape.</p>

<p>Next, assuming I have framed the scene I want, I first level my tripod. I&#8217;m thinking of buying a tripod leveling attachment for my ballhead, but so far in my career I have managed with just leveling my tripod by adjusting its legs and then re-leveling if I have to move it. That can get tedious pretty fast.</p>

<p>Once leveled I mount my chosen camera and lens onto the nodal slide attachment I own (<a href="http://www.reallyrightstuff.com">Really Right Stuff</a>). In turn I place this entire setup on the tripod. Now I level the nodal slide/camera unit. I also check to be sure that I have the lens positioned correctly on the slide to avoid parallax problems (that&#8217;s the nodal point). I always use a cable release for my tripod work and panos are no exception.</p>

<p>Now I pan right and left (or up and down if I&#8217;m shooting a vertical panorama). So far, so good, because if it isn&#8217;t that means I may have to move my tripod and level it again.</p>

<p>I put all my camera settings on manual. I focus, pan and focus again to get it right. I get my exposure settings where I want them. I fiddle with my graduated neutral density filters to adjust the dynamic range to where I like it. I may take a few test pictures to calibrate exposure.</p>

<p>Next I figure out how much overlap I want in the images. Typically I like a 30% overlap, although 20% will also work. It is entirely possible to just eyeball this overlap, but I usually resort to using the gradations on my ballhead for greater precision.</p>

<h3>Shooting Panos At Night</h3>


<p>There is one thing I want to mention about that panning process. If you are panning a night scene, you would do better to use the gradations etched into your ballhead mount, since eyeballing it in the dark may not be accurate.</p>

<p><a href="http://blog.lesterpickerphoto.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/09/BH55LR.png"><img class="size-medium wp-image-2347" title="BH55LR" src="http://blog.lesterpickerphoto.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/09/BH55LR-300x300.png" alt="" width="300" height="300"></a></p>

<p>Of course using tiny gradation marks presents its own problem, since you don&#8217;t want to be accidentally shining a light from your headlamp into your lens at a critical moment. I use a headlamp with a red light just for security sake. At night I have a routine that goes something like this: focus and fiddle until right, close the back eyepiece window, flip up the mirror (to minimize camera shake), and I&#8217;m ready for the pano sequence. Press the cable release, switch on red headlamp, unlock ballhead rotation clamp, rotate ballhead x notches, turn off light, screw down ballhead rotation clamp, press cable release and repeat until the pano sequence is complete.</p>

<h3>Man on a Mission</h3>


<p>Once I start my pano I am like a man on mission. Don&#8217;t talk to me, don&#8217;t distract me, don&#8217;t even get too close to me! I am clicking, shifting, retightening, and shooting again. Once I&#8217;m done with the sequence, I breathe. In my defense, I feel it&#8217;s important to move quickly because of how fast light changes, clouds move, and trees sway.</p>

<p>I always shoot the pano again, maybe varying the exposure by 1/3 or 1/2 stop. There are also times when I&#8217;ll shoot 3 images at each stop, one properly exposed, one stop over and one under. That gives Bob Boyer, my Master Printmaker, a chance to fill in some of the shaded areas with a little light from the overexposed image(s).</p>

<h3>What is a Pano Anyway?</h3>


<p>There is also the issue of what constitutes a pano. I&#8217;m not one to shoot huge panos, although the one of the Baltimore Harbor shown here is a collection of 14 vertical images, the most I have ever done.</p>

<p><a href="http://blog.lesterpickerphoto.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/09/harbor-flat-small.jpg"><img class="size-medium wp-image-2341" title="harbor-flat-small" src="http://blog.lesterpickerphoto.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/09/harbor-flat-small-300x89.jpg" alt="" width="300" height="89"></a></p>

<p>In that case I needed it for a wall covering installation that spans 29 feet! I needed every pixel I was able to lasso to get a printed image that looks good. Some folks I know use the GigaPan device, which can shoot hundreds of images in a panorama. Since I shoot a Hasselblad in RAW and I have a 6-year old Mac computer, I&#8217;ll skip that technology for right now.</p>

<p>Most of the time I will take 3 images to build a pano. But, I&#8217;m also thinking of how I will use them. Sometimes, as with the Baltimore Harbor wall covering, I need something long and narrow. Other times I will need something nearly square for a client&#8217;s wall space (a 2-shot pano?). So, while I&#8217;m in a particular location, I&#8217;ll try various combos to afford me some flexibility.</p>

<p><a href="http://blog.lesterpickerphoto.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/09/LAP0869-Panorama.jpg"><img class="size-medium wp-image-2342" title="_LAP0869 Panorama" src="http://blog.lesterpickerphoto.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/09/LAP0869-Panorama-300x123.jpg" alt="" width="300" height="123"></a></p>

<p>I&#8217;m sure I&#8217;ve left some things out. As always, if you have any questions or wish to make a comment, feel free to do so here.</p>

<hr />

<p>I was alone in the Canadian Rockies, spending two glorious weeks photographing in one of my favorite places on Earth. This particular day dawned overcast and bone-chilling cold, the perfect day for a landscape photographer! I drove in and around Kananaskis National Park and I stopped for an energy bar breakfast on the shores of Spray Lake.</p>

<p>The clouds hung low and were moving fast, sure signs of an approaching storm. As I looked north down the lake, what caught my eye was the contrast between the crystal clear water, rocks and the impending storm. Yet, and here is where I was taken in, the sun was able to tinge the distant clouds with a touch of pink.</p>

<p>I ran back to my car to retrieve my waders and kneeled in the water to get the rocks in the foreground the way I wanted.</p>

<p>I am constantly struck by the moments of pure grace that present themselves to us if we are fortunate enough to be tuned in at that moment. Such was the case with the following image. I was with a group of fellow photographers and we had been out since 4:30 AM photographing a mountainscape sunrise (see Rampart Pond Sunrise Limited Edition print) in the spectacular Canadian Rockies.</p>

<p>We were heading back to our lodge, tired and hungry, not having eaten for about eight hours. Yet the late fall sunset called to us and so we stopped. The clouds rolled in frustrating our attempts to capture what had been a compelling scene. Everyone trudged through the snow back to the van. All but me, that is. I saw a tiny crack developing in the clouds over the mountain. I reset my tripod, crouched down next to the pond and snapped this swatch of sunset. In an instant it was gone. Even as I packed up my gear I knew I had been anointed. Providence happens.</p>

<p>Contrary to the myth about professional photographers, I really do not carry my camera around me with everywhere. In this case I was eating dinner with my wife and our granddaughter at the fine restaurant at the Moraine Lake lodge. The solarium-like dining room allowed us to take in the grandeur of the lake. Throughout the meal the setting sun kept tantalizing me. To my credit, I withstood its siren-song through appetizers, salad and nearly all my entree.</p>

<p>Then I started seeing this image forming. My understanding wife and granddaughter blessed my taking off before dessert. I ran to my room, grabbed my gear and bolted for the rock summit overlooking this pristine lake.</p>

<p>Moraine Lake is truly my favorite in the Canadian Rockies. The eleven peaks that surround it add a spiritual dimension that one can only appreciate when the crowds are gone in Fall. And, yes, the lake is truly this color when the sun shines on its pristine surface.</p>

<p>I love Alberta, Canada and its awe inspiring National Parks. Both Jasper and Banff National Parks, as well as Kananaskis, are eye candy for the landscape photographer (and not too shabby for wildlife photographers either). I try to get to Alberta at least once every two years, to immerse myself in its beauty.</p>

<p>On this fall day, it had drizzled most of the morning and into afternoon, but when I arrived at Hillsdale Meadow it had just stopped. The good news was that the rain kept the crowds to a bare minimum, allowing me time to saunter through the meadow, finding the compositions I wanted.</p>

<p>As typically happens, it wasn&#8217;t until I was ready to leave that I noticed the touch of alpenglow on the peak just above the trees. I grabbed my tripod and ran to a spot I had photographed earlier. Over the next fifteen minutes I shot several frames and then the clouds moved in and it began to rain once again. But when I looked at my camera screen through my loupe, I knew I had captured the image I wanted.</p>

Those of you who read my blog know how much I like and admire Richard, a friend and very capable pro photographer from the Yukon (you&#8217;ve got to be capable to make a living as a photographer in the Yukon). But, damn him all the same!
Richard managed to capture this incredible Northern Lights image just a few miles from his home in Whitehorse. Folks, this is only mid-August and it&#8217;s rare to get Northern Lights this early. But the lights are at an 11-year peak from now through 2013, which is why Richard and I are heading to Iceland together in September, 2013 to get some Fall images there, along with, hopefully, the Northern Lights. I thought I&#8217;d share Richard&#8217;s incredible image with you. It was taken next to Schwatka Lake on the outskirts of Whitehorse, the capital of Yukon Territory.</p>

<p>For now at least, Richard has the upper hand in our friendly rivalry. Damn him!</p>

<p> </p>

<p>If you intend to enter the world of panoramic photography, you will eventually come across the term “nodal point.” Nodal point? Did I say that?</p>

<p>Truth be known, I had already written a lengthy blog about nodal points and how they can improve your panoramas and was set to publish it  today. I had spent a few hours on Saturday determining the nodal points for each of my Hasselblad and Nikon lenses that I use for panoramic photography. As I did a last fact-check, though, I happened across a set of URLs by <a href="http://www.reallyrightstuff.com">Really Right Stuff</a>, a company that makes my tripod ball head, my camera brackets, my macro rails, and my pano equipment. After spending an hour or so with their materials I realized there was no need to do a separate blog on the topic. I’m certain you’ll find everything you want to know about panorama photography in their wonderful, easy-to-understand explanations. I’ll give you the starting URL in a moment. First a few comments.</p>

<p>Many point-and-shoot (PAS) cameras have a built in panorama feature, sometimes known as &#8220;stitching.&#8221; You simply go to the menu, tell the camera you’re about to shoot a panorama, point the camera at each section and- voila!- the camera processes a panorama for you! Pretty nifty. And the more this feature has advanced over the past few years, the better the results. If you’re happy with the panoramas you’re getting from your PAS, stop here and be very, very grateful. Here is an example of the stitching capability in the Canon G12 PAS, called &#8220;Stitch Assist.&#8221; You&#8217;ll have to study the manual carefully to uncover this function. However, it&#8217;s worth the effort.</p>

<p><a href="http://blog.lesterpickerphoto.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/08/photo.jpg"><img class="size-medium wp-image-2328" title="photo" src="http://blog.lesterpickerphoto.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/08/photo-300x225.jpg" alt="" width="300" height="225"></a></p>

<p>Naturally, there are hints to improve even a PAS in-camera pano; pre-visualize what the pano will incorporate, overlap the images by 20-30%, keep your elbows close to your body, keep the camera tight to your eye and rotate your body at the waist, keeping the camera as even and level to the ground as possible.</p>

<p>The next step, if you want higher quality images is to use a tripod, whether with a PAS or a DSLR. That way the camera stays as steady as we can possibly get it to be and we just rotate it to include as much of the scene as we wish. If you don’t have in-camera panorama capability, you simply export the images to what is known as a “stitching” program, such as <a href="http://www.ptgui.com">PTGUI</a> (yes, that’s really its name), and you’re off to the races. Alternately, PhotoShop, as well as other programs, stitch together panoramas very handily.</p>

<p>So, what is the problem and how does it relate to nodal points? Hold your thumb out at arm’s length, pointed up. Close one eye. Now , looking at the thumb, turn your head right and left. Notice how the thumb seems to move? That is known as parallax. The same thing happens when you pan your camera right and left. That makes it harder for pano software programs to work their magic.</p>

<p><a href="http://blog.lesterpickerphoto.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/08/pano-arrows.gif"><img class="size-medium wp-image-2326" title="pano-arrows" src="http://blog.lesterpickerphoto.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/08/pano-arrows-291x300.gif" alt="" width="291" height="300"></a></p>

<p>The technical explanation is complicated, but if you want to read about it in more detail, and understand how to correct for this and improve your panoramas, visit the folks at Really Right Stuff <a href="http://reallyrightstuff.com/WebsiteInfo.aspx?fc=108">for an explanation</a> (and some great equipment).</p>

<p>In <a title="Panoramas: Part 2" href="http://blog.lesterpickerphoto.com/2012/09/02/panoramas-part-2-how-i-do-it/">Part 2</a> I&#8217;ll review how I handle panoramas, using examples from my own work. Stay tuned!</p>

		  <div class="entry-content"><p>One of the many things I love about what I do is the periodic challenge that comes up as we attempt to provide for our clients more than they expect. Recently Bob (my assistant) and I were faced with a particularly challenging challenge.</p>

<p>A Baltimore teaching hospital chose me as their exclusive artist for a new medical wing, slated to open in October. The project is massive for us, with approximately 75 of my images, some as large as 29-feet wide (on a wall covering), and others 40” wide (on classic archival photo paper and traditionally framed), plus some other specialized photographic applications. Sure, this is a major undertaking involving image selection, multiple rounds of client approvals, planning, ordering, printing, framing and, eventually, installation. I also had to do custom shooting of local Baltimore scenes. But the client requested one thing more, and therein lay the challenge.</p>

<p>As a non-profit hospital, they depend on generous donors to support their healing arts. Did we have any ideas, they wondered, how we might help them honor their donors to this state-of-the-art medical wing (without spending too much money in the process)?</p>

<p>Bob and I did some research and reached out to colleagues, such as the incredible Andy Biggs (<a href="http://www.andybiggs.com">www.andybiggs.com</a>), one of my favorite photographers. Andy suggested that we consider using individually boxed sets of images.</p>

<p>We found a small American business that creates hand-crafted, cloth-covered boxes. These one-of-a-kind boxes are as beautiful as they are functional. Since they are completely custom-made, a photographer (or other end-user) can order them in any size and depth. We knew we wanted to offer the donors about a dozen images, plus some forward materials, such as a title page, a letter from the Chief Executive and a thank you from the doctor who will be heading up the new unit.</p>

<p>Bob and I worked for weeks to develop the styling, color and design of the box. In the end we came up with a respectable mockup.</p>

<p><a href="http://blog.lesterpickerphoto.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/08/DSC9543-as-Smart-Object-1.jpg"><img class="alignnone size-medium wp-image-2350" title="_DSC9543 as Smart Object-1" src="http://blog.lesterpickerphoto.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/08/DSC9543-as-Smart-Object-1-300x198.jpg" alt="" width="300" height="198"></a></p>

<p>But we were faced with both the functional, as well as aesthetic issue of how to separate the individual prints within the box to prevent scratching. I also do not like my images to be cluttered with a descriptive title or location information right on the print. So Bob and I came up with what we think is an innovative solution.</p>

<p><a href="http://blog.lesterpickerphoto.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/08/DSC9554-as-Smart-Object-1.jpg"><img class="alignnone size-medium wp-image-2314" title="_DSC9554 as Smart Object-1" src="http://blog.lesterpickerphoto.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/08/DSC9554-as-Smart-Object-1-300x198.jpg" alt="" width="300" height="198"></a></p>

<p> </p>

<p>We are using sheets of translucent vellum to separate the prints.</p>

<p><a href="http://blog.lesterpickerphoto.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/08/DSC9563-as-Smart-Object-1.jpg"><img class="alignnone size-medium wp-image-2315" title="_DSC9563 as Smart Object-1" src="http://blog.lesterpickerphoto.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/08/DSC9563-as-Smart-Object-1-300x198.jpg" alt="" width="300" height="198"></a></p>

<p> </p>

<p>Bob masterfully printed the descriptive information on the vellum with a gorgeous screen, so that the information can always be associated with the correct image. We can’t wait to see the reactions of the donors this fall. When the actual final product is ready, we’ll do a separate shoot and share it with you. In the meantime, I’d love to get your feedback.</p>

		  <div class="entry-content"><p>As promised, this is another in a continuing series of reviews on my experience as a pro photographer and an owner of a Hasselblad H4D-50 system. For those of you wondering what the heck that is, allow me to explain.</p>

<p><a href="http://blog.lesterpickerphoto.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/08/images.jpeg"><img class="size-full wp-image-2304" title="images" src="http://blog.lesterpickerphoto.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/08/images.jpeg" alt="" width="284" height="177"></a></p>

<p>Hasselblad is a medium format camera system. That means that the sensor is significantly larger than a standard 35mm camera and of a slightly different shape (4:3 ratio vs. 3:2 for a DSLR). Instead of the typical 12-16 megapixels (MP) per image you’ll find on most 35mm cameras, the Hasselblad (‘Hassy’) registers images at a mind-blowing 50MP. Other digital Hassy cameras record at 40, 60 and 200MP. The more pixels, the better detail there is when enlarging images. Since I often have to enlarge images to 30 or 40 inches on the short side, more pixels are a good thing. Just last week we printed wallpaper images that were 29-feet  and 19-feet wide!! That is how I justified my H4D purchase.</p>

<p>Two trips this year allowed me to test the Hassy with no-holds-barred. I spent 25 days in Sri Lanka and 16 days in Iceland, with extremes of hot and cold, humid and dry, hurricane winds and calm evenings.</p>

<p>Although I always had my Nikon system with me as backup or, in the case of action shots, as my primary system, the bottom line is that I find using the Hassy an increasingly joyful experience. After 40 years of photography, I relish the chance to use the Hassy, even preferring it over my Nikons in certain conditions (and I own the newest Nikon D800 with 36MP). Using the Hassy forces me to slow down. I find myself more thoughtfully exposing, metering and composing, and I figure that’s a good thing. There is no high speed mode. It has few fancy electronic doo-dads.  It is all about ridiculously finely engineered machinery, top quality lenses, the landscape and you. Frankly, I love that combo.</p>

<p>Most of all, my assistant, Bob Boyer, and I love the smooth, rich tonality evident in every image. It is as close to film-like as you can get, but with the added benefit of digital capture for post-processing flexibility. The files are insanely detailed, but with smooth gradations that don’t flash “DIGITAL” in your face.</p>

<p>To be honest, my Hassy does have its drawbacks, as I’ve mentioned in other blogs. Chief among them is that it is not weatherproofed. For landscape shooters that is a serious drawback. However, to be fair I did shoot with it in 70MPH hurricane force winds in Iceland and got results that I just fell in love with. Of course, I protected the camera and lens as best as I could and did not take the chance of swapping lenses in mid-shoot.</p>

<p><a href="http://blog.lesterpickerphoto.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/08/A0020169-as-Smart-Object-1.jpg"><img class="size-medium wp-image-2301" title="A0020169 as Smart Object-1" src="http://blog.lesterpickerphoto.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/08/A0020169-as-Smart-Object-1-300x225.jpg" alt="" width="300" height="225"></a></p>

<p> </p>

<p>Another drawback is its size and weight, topping the scales at 7.5 pounds for the body and a 28mm lens with the tilt-shift attachment. At my age I simply cannot use it for any length of time unless it is tripod mounted, which is fine for landscape. The camera and lenses are also bulky, forcing me to painfully agonize over my equipment choices when I travel.</p>

<p>Another factor to consider when evaluating a Hassy purchase is its price. The H4D body alone costs upwards of $30,000. Add a 28mm lens (22mm in 35mm equivalent coverage) for $4,000 and a 50-110 for $6,000 and, like Senator Everett Dirkson once said, pretty soon your talking real money. On the plus side, Hassy has recently announced a 20% price reduction, in part because of pressure from the likes of Nikon with its new D800, packing 36MP. I might add that those of us who invested in Hassy at full price are not exactly thrilled.</p>

<p>But, the proof is in the pudding and the question is: Would I do it all over again? Damn right I would!</p>

		  <div class="entry-content"><p>It’s not often that a latest-greatest camera comes out and I feel like I have to have it. In fact, I was perfectly happy with my Nikon D700, which I’ve had since it debuted. It is a great camera; well built, easy to use, and it produces spectacular images. It is flexible and has allowed me to execute my vision, even under challenging environmental conditions. Besides, I also shoot a medium format Hasselblad H4D-50, so I had pixels if I needed them.</p>

<p> </p>

<p>When the Nikon D800 was announced I was, quite frankly, skeptical. Initial reports were that it sported a 16-megapixel (MP) sensor. Not interested. That was soon raised to 18-MP. Still not interested. Then it was 24 MP and you know what? I suddenly got interested. I had D3x envy for two years and I figured now was my time to get revenge, and at a price point some $5,000 lower! Sweet.</p>

<p> </p>

<p>And lo and behold, when the clouds parted, it came to pass that the Nikon D800 premiered at 36 MP!! Yes, you read that right. 36 glorious, huge, detailed MEGA pixels. I bought one the day Nikon announced its availability.</p>

<p> </p>

<p>Now, you’re probably wondering why I would get so excited over a camera that really doesn’t do a whole lot more than the D700. The answer lies in them thar pixels, of course. Much of my business is in large prints. Not the 12” x 18” inch variety, nor the 16” x 24” size.  Most of my prints are a minimum of 20” x 30” and bigger- a lot bigger.</p>

<p> </p>

<p>Right now I’m in the process of printing thirty, 40” x 30” images for a client, who also purchased several 4-foot wide images, some 8-footers and- ready for this one?- one 29-feet wide by 9-feet tall image! It’s just not possible to get a print even 40” wide from a 12-MP camera and have it come out at the quality I expect, even if one uses Perfect Resize or a similar software program.</p>

<p> </p>

<p>So, for this 29-foot wall I needed a solid image of Baltimore. What’s more iconic than Baltimore’s Inner Harbor, I figured? As it turned out, the week I wanted to shoot the Inner Harbor, several tall ships sailed into Baltimore in what was called a Sailabration, to celebrate the 200 year anniversary of the bombardment of Fort McHenry and Francis Scott Key’s penning of the Star Spangled Banner.</p>

<p> </p>

<p>I set up my tripod before twilight, leveled it carefully, mounted my D800 with a 200-400mm lens in vertical position, and leveled that, too, using a Really Right Stuff panning attachment. I checked my pan, left to right, up and down. Once I felt I had the right light, I started shooting. It took 9 images going from left to right to encompass the entire scene with water in the foreground. Then I repeated the sequence tilting my setup to encompass sky and shot another 9. This had to be done quickly to minimize light changes. It was also very windy that day and I had to hang my backpack from my tripod to add center mass.</p>

<p> </p>

<p>In post-processing my assistant, Bob Boyer, merged the entire shoot in PhotoShop CS6, producing this image (click on it to enlarge):</p>

<p> </p>

<p><a href="http://blog.lesterpickerphoto.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/07/harbor-flat-small.jpg"><img class="size-medium wp-image-2292" title="Baltimore Harbor" src="http://blog.lesterpickerphoto.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/07/harbor-flat-small-300x89.jpg" alt="" width="300" height="89"></a></p>

<p> </p>

<p>What I am struck with, what we were both struck with, is the level of detail in the image. Even blown up 100% or more and printed on vinyl wallpaper, the results are, to quote Bob, “freakin’ fantastic.” In the image below, note the tiny red frame within the full image in the upper right. That is the blow-up that you are looking at below. Consider this: the images were taken about a mile away, and in a stiff, gusty wind no less! Not only can you make out the lettering on the ship clearly, but you can see the couple sitting on nearby deck.</p>

<p> </p>

<p><a href="http://blog.lesterpickerphoto.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/07/harbor-screen.jpg"><img class="size-medium wp-image-2293" title="Baltimore harbor-screen shot" src="http://blog.lesterpickerphoto.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/07/harbor-screen-300x187.jpg" alt="" width="300" height="187"></a></p>

<p>So, in this test anyway, the D800 passes with flying colors! More field tests upcoming.</p>

<p>BTW, if you&#8217;re interested in Bob&#8217;s perspective on the wallpaper image and its installation, check his blog <a href="http://photo.rwboyer.com/2012/07/27/things-you-learn-in-fourth-grade/">here</a>. Bob also reminded me that the image is actually a tad bit over 30-feet wide, not 29.</p>

		  <div class="entry-content"><p>Earlier this year I was named the winner of the Canada Northern Lights Award for my travel photography. More than 300 entries were considered from photojournalists all over the world. The Missouri School of Journalism picked the final winners for best travel writing and best photography. Needless to say (but I’ll say it anyway), I was honored.</p>

<p> </p>

<p>I was told that the award itself would arrive later. I waited and waited, but nothing arrived. In a follow-up e-mail I was told that the award was an original sculpture and would take time to hand craft.</p>

<p> </p>

<p>Just two weeks ago the award arrived and when I opened the box I could hardly believe what a beautiful work of art the award is. It was rendered by Canadian artist <a href="http://www.metalperks.com">Michael Perks</a> who lives and works in Okotoks, Alberta. Michael recently won his own award as Best New Artist at the 2011 Calgary Stampede.</p>

<p><a href="http://blog.lesterpickerphoto.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/07/Northern-Lights-Award-4-of-4.jpg"><img class="alignnone size-medium wp-image-2284" title="Canada Northern Lights Award " src="http://blog.lesterpickerphoto.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/07/Northern-Lights-Award-4-of-4-300x225.jpg" alt="" width="300" height="225"></a></p>

<p>To me, the award is so very special because of the way Michael interpreted the Northern Lights. I remember vividly the first time I witnessed the Northern Lights. I was standing on a mountaintop in Canada’s Yukon wilderness when they suddenly blazed across the sky. Nothing had prepared me for that moment. They literally took my breath away and I sank to my knees, thankful for the privilege of living in that moment. Every time I have seen them since I feel awed by their majestic, mysterious beauty.

<p>In Michael’s sculpture I see the lights streaking across the stylized mountain. As honored as I am with the award itself, I am equally honored to have Michael’s work remind me every day of the beauty one experiences uniquely in Canada’s amazing landscape.</p>

		  <div class="entry-content"><p>I had a gallery show last night, which is a lot of work to put on, but also very enjoyable. I love meeting people at these events and they area great source for contacts, talking to some interesting folks and even some revenue.</p>

<p>About halfway through the evening a couple walked in. The man was a big, friendly bruiser and he walked straight over to this black &amp; white, unframed print that was hanging up. I watched him peer closely at it for a moment and then turn to his wife and say something. She shook her head approvingly. Curious, I walked over to them to see if they had any questions about the image.</p>

<p><a href="http://blog.lesterpickerphoto.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/07/LAP2875-1.jpg"><img class="size-medium wp-image-2257" title="_LAP2875 (1)" src="http://blog.lesterpickerphoto.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/07/LAP2875-1-199x300.jpg" alt="" width="199" height="300"></a></p>

<p>In the way of background, this has always been one of my favorite images, if for no other reason than it reminds me of the day I took it. I was in Canada and was taken to this spot by a friend of mine, the talented photographer <a href="http://www.darwinwiggett.com">Darwin Wiggett</a>. We hiked through pristine woods to find this vehicle sitting in the midst of a forest. How did it get there? When did it get there? Most curious was what model car was it? I figured I&#8217;d never find out.</p>

<p>Now back to my story at the gallery. I walk over to the couple and introduce myself. The man turns to me and, pointing to the print, simply says:</p>

<p>&#8220;1942 Chevy Coupe with suicide doors and a Flathead V-8 engine.&#8221;</p>

<p>At first I stood there dumbstruck. Then I burst out with a hearty laugh, thanked him profusely and wrote down the information as he repeated it to me. He walked out and I smiled for the rest of the evening every time I glanced at the print.</p>

<p>You just never know.</p>

		  <div class="entry-content"><p>On Friday, July 6, beginning at 6:00 PM, I will be the featured artist at La Banque de Fleuve in Havre de Grace, Maryland. This is part of Havre de Grace’s seasonal tradition of First Fridays which plays out from May through October in grand fashion along its downtown streets.</p>

<p>I love First Fridays. There is music (and dancing) in the street by many bands and solo performers, from jazz to rock to folk. There is scrumptious food to be sampled from street vendors and our terrific town restaurants. Street performers roam around providing entertainment for families. There is a vintage car show and crafts of all kinds. Most of all are the wonderful people you meet, coming from all over the region.</p>

<p>This is the very first time my work will be featured in La Banque, a unique and impressive event and meeting venue in the heart of downtown. La Banque, as its name implies, is a historic granite bank and the immense, walk-in vault is still on display and functions as a wine-tasting room.</p>

<p><a href="http://blog.lesterpickerphoto.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/06/A0017443-Edit-Upres.jpg"><img class="size-medium wp-image-2250" src="http://blog.lesterpickerphoto.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/06/A0017443-Edit-Upres-300x150.jpg" alt="" width="300" height="150"></a></p>

<p>If you are looking for a memorable time, please visit Havre de Grace on Friday evening, July 6. If you print out this blog or its notice on Facebook or Twitter, I’ll extend 10% off the purchase of any of my images, framed or unframed. I&#8217;ll have framed Limited Edition prints for sale, as well as unframed works, and sale items. So, if you&#8217;re looking to decorate a home or office, or just searching for that perfect piece of art, please stop by. Browsers are also most welcome.</p>

<p>I look forward to seeing you there!</p>

		  <div class="entry-content"><p>For most of my life I’ve been a film photographer. In those days the mantra I followed was that when I pressed the shutter, my job was essentially done. I’d send my K64 film off to Kodak, get my transparencies back a week later, present them to my editors and cash my check. Done.</p>

<p>Not anymore. In today’s digital age, I figure my job is maybe 25-50% done when I press that shutter button. Even though I really do not do much post-processing, digitally captured images do need some tweaking, especially if you are shooting in RAW with settings on ‘neutral.’ The truth is I don’t even know how to use PhotoShop. I entered the digital game too late in life to teach this old dog tricks of that complexity, although I admit to a certain degree of envy when I watch my assistant, Bob, handle PhotoShop like it was an extension of his fingers. Instead, I post-process in Lightroom and, if needed, use the Nik software line of products to do some tweaking. Mostly that involves just using Viveza.</p>

<p>However, there are some instances where you just have to do some significant post-processing and this past week was one of them. I thought I’d share that with you.</p>

<p>When I was in Iceland, I was shooting some waterfalls with both my Hasselblad H4D-50 and my new Nikon D800. On each lens I had a polarizer, so I could fine tune the reflections in the water. A polarizer reduces the amount of light hitting the sensor by about 1 stop or maybe a bit more, which was good in this case because I wanted the water to have a smooth look to it which you can only achieve with a very slow shutter speed.</p>

<p>In fact, I did not like the results I was getting. I wanted to slow the water down even more. But I was already shooting at ISO 50 on the Hassy, the lowest setting it would take. So, I added a 4-stop neutral density filter, meaning I was holding back about 4 stops of light. ND filters block light hitting the sensor without causing color shifts. Or that is what they are supposed to do.</p>

<p>I got my slowed down water movement all right. But when I got home and examined my images, I saw that they had a very pronounced color cast. They all had a yucky (that’s a technical term, btw) pink-magenta cast.</p>

<p><a href="http://blog.lesterpickerphoto.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/06/A0019604.jpg"><img class="size-medium wp-image-2246" title="A0019604" src="http://blog.lesterpickerphoto.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/06/A0019604-300x225.jpg" alt="" width="300" height="225"></a></p>

<p>We picked up the phone to talk to the incredible Bob Singh, the maker of Singh-Ray filters. Bob is one of the most knowledgeable people in the industry and while his products are costly, they are high quality all the way and backed by Bob’s technical genius.</p>

<p>Without getting too technical, it turns out that the ND filter I was using blocked out visible light in a different proportion to the infrared (IR) light, and that was responsible for the color shift. The solution was simple. Bob could make a filter that filtered both sets of wavelengths so that this would not happen again. I ordered one immediately. I’m a believer in getting it right in-camera and not digitally manipulating the image after the fact.</p>

<p>But, what to do with the images I already had? In this case Bob (my assistant) worked his magic in PhotoShop CS6. It took quite a bit of doing, messing with color channels and temperatures and such, but in the end he was able to render the scene pretty near what I had experienced, which is the image that follows. That pretty well reinforces my belief that in some situations post-processing work is an effective and necessary tool.</p>

		  <div class="entry-content"><p>By now I hope you are all in the throes of summer, enjoying the warm weather and capturing lots of ‘keeper’ outdoor images. Of course, no passionate landscape/wildlife photographer ever gets enough time outdoors or enough keepers to feel fully satisfied. It’s like eating a great meal. At the end you feel wonderful, but in a few hours you’re hungry again.</p>

<p>As you go through your summer routine, why not take notes on areas of your photography that you’d like to improve? Do you have trouble interpreting light well enough to nail perfect exposures? Do your compositions lack punch? Are your images ‘soft’ looking?</p>

<p>I am a voracious digester of photographic information, so books and articles are my first stop when learning a new technique, keeping up with technological advances, or reading about the exploits of my colleagues. But at some point, I invariably find that I have to put those readings into practice by actually getting outdoors to try them. Sometimes I go out photographing with colleagues and marvel at the way they choose to interpret a scene, what techniques they apply and the post-processing they do to render their unique creative vision.</p>

<p>That is why I so strongly recommend that amateurs immerse themselves in photo workshops from time to time, whether to learn new techniques, see new vistas led by a photographer guide, or share ideas and images with fellow enthusiasts. Photo workshops ideally should be a small group. They are a lot of fun, mixed with some terrific take-aways in terms of techniques and ideas.</p>

<p>I’m leading just such a workshop to Acadia National Park along Maine’s photogenic rocky and forested coast beginning October 18. Fall is a gorgeous time of year in Maine, with reds and yellows and browns painting vivid landscapes. This 4-day experience will be chock full of vistas-to-die-for (but of course I promise to keep things very safe). Photography along the Maine coast is entirely weather dependent, but I’ve chosen venues that we can access in rain, shine or fog. Speaking of fog, that is definitely one of my favorite times to photograph in Maine.</p>

<p><a href="http://blog.lesterpickerphoto.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/06/LAP2300.jpg"><img class="size-medium wp-image-2238" title="_LAP2300" src="http://blog.lesterpickerphoto.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/06/LAP2300-300x199.jpg" alt="" width="300" height="199"></a></p>

<p>I lived in Maine for ten years and actually did part of my doctoral work in ecology in Acadia NP. I think I know some of the nicest photo locations there. Suffice it to say that we’ll be visiting the storied rocky coast, the park’s pristine forests, marshes and ponds, picturesque towns and even some lobster boats. We’ll be on the move from sunrise to sunset (Did you know that Acadia’s Cadillac Mountain is the first place to witness sunrise in the U.S.?).</p>

<p><a href="http://blog.lesterpickerphoto.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/06/LAP8300.jpg"><img class="size-medium wp-image-2239" title="_LAP8300" src="http://blog.lesterpickerphoto.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/06/LAP8300-300x199.jpg" alt="" width="300" height="199"></a></p>

<p>While the workshop is offered through the Nikonians Academy, where I am a faculty member, it makes absolutely no difference what make camera you have, whether you use a point-and-shoot or a $50,000 super pro setup, or whether you are a beginner or advanced amateur. You are guaranteed to learn something, meet interesting fellow photographers and have a good time (did I mention lobster dinner??). The course is strictly limited to 10 photographers. Only five spots remain.</p>

<p>On one or two of the evenings we will get a chance for a voluntary critique of our work (mine included). No one is coerced into offering their images up for group sacrifice. It’s all very informal and friendly and I’ve never had anyone say they did not benefit from even passively observing. I know I always get a lot out of these sessions (alternately, you could choose to skip it entirely and get an extra hour of shuteye!).</p>

<p><a href="http://blog.lesterpickerphoto.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/06/Maine-2009-longpond1-1_-2__tonemapped.jpg"><img class="size-medium wp-image-2240 " title="Maine-longpond" src="http://blog.lesterpickerphoto.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/06/Maine-2009-longpond1-1_-2__tonemapped-199x300.jpg" alt="" width="199" height="300"></a></p>

		  <div class="entry-content"><p>I received the following email a few days ago from one of my regular blog readers.</p>

<p><em>Les, </em></p>

<p><em>As an experienced and successful photographer I would appreciate your thinking on something that has bothered me for a long time. There is no end to the array of photography products that are introduced: cameras, lenses, etc.  There is always something new to be found in photography periodicals, store advertisements (e.g. Adorama, B+H )and so on. I ,for one, simply can never afford to get into that game and there has to be some rational way for saying to oneself , &#8220;enough already!&#8221;   I very much want to grow and learn in my retirement years but sometimes I feel overwhelmed by what I read about some product that is &#8220;new and revolutionary&#8221; …. You are a professional and obviously your needs are different than mine, i.e., to be a first rate amateur photographer especially interested in nature and landscape scenes.  I guess that you have been asked that question on different occasions.  I would appreciate if you would let me have the benefit of your thinking. </em></p>

<p> </p>

<p>Thanks, Harry. In truth, I do get asked this often, and so I thought I’d respond here (Harry gave me permission to reprint his question).</p>

<p>First, I can’t agree with you more. After a while it can get to be more of a game than a true necessity. The obvious beneficiary are the camera and accessory companies. The question that one must face, whether amateur or pro, is whether or not the latest, greatest is really necessary to get quality images.</p>

<p>I’ll be the first to say that some of the products really represent major advances and should be thoughtfully considered. Others represent small conveniences that make picture-taking far easier and more enjoyable. Take my Hoodman loupe, for example (<a href="http://www.hoodmanusa.com/products.asp?dept=1017">www.hoodmanusa.com</a>). That’s one small, inexpensive device that I could not live without. It has truly changed my picture taking for the better.</p>

<p><a href="http://blog.lesterpickerphoto.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/06/HLPP3_11full.gif"><img class="alignnone size-medium wp-image-2232" title="HLPP3_11(full)" src="http://blog.lesterpickerphoto.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/06/HLPP3_11full-300x199.gif" alt="" width="300" height="199"></a></p>

<p>When it comes to major items, such as cameras and lenses, I have serious doubts about the latest, greatest. Some improvements are incremental. Let me give you an example. I owned and enjoyed my Nikon D300 camera. Then Nikon came out with the D300S. It allowed one to take videos. I don’t take videos, so it had no appeal to me.</p>

<p>On the other hand, I own a Nikon D700, which is a 12 mega-pixel (MP) camera. It is a very fine, even wonderful camera. In the past several years my clients have demanded larger and larger images (we are currently producing a 29-foot image for one of our hospital clients!). So, when the Nikon D800 camera debuted a couple of months ago, touting a 36-MP sensor, I jumped. Those extra pixels will enable me to make much bigger and sharper enlargements. That is the main reason I spent $3,000 for a camera that essentially does just what my D700 does. (BTW, my D700 is now for sale, with a host of accessories. If you’re interested, please contact me.) So far the D800 has met my high expectations.</p>

<p><a href="http://blog.lesterpickerphoto.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/06/images.jpeg"><img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-2233" title="images" src="http://blog.lesterpickerphoto.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/06/images.jpeg" alt="" width="229" height="221"></a></p>

<p>Do I need the D800 to make a good image? Of course not. Good images are a combination of good light, good composition, technical mastery and creative vision. Lots of great images are made on iPhones and 12 MP cameras. If all you will do with your images is post them on Facebook or other electronic venues, then a point-and-shoot will do nicely. If you are only making prints up to 8.5” x 11”, then there’s no need to upgrade.</p>

<p>The same holds true for lenses. I have some Nikon lenses that are more than 30 years old and they still perform flawlessly and work with even my newest D800. Unless there is a compelling reason for me to buy a new lens, I’m fine with the assortment I have. Periodically I will sell an older lens to upgrade to a newer one, but there is always a reason for my doing so. I recently upgraded my 200-400mm lens because I was shooting more wildlife and needed a faster lens that I could use effectively in lower light conditions and would also enable me to blur the background so that the main subject stands out. It’s hard making money in photography today, so my main rule is that only if I feel the new product can help me make better, more salable images will I consider buying it.</p>

<p>Hope this helps.</p>

		  <div class="entry-content"><p>Every so often I like to challenge my readers with a photo assignment; not a meaningless exercise  to fill blog space, but one based on a photographic experience that I recently had. That was the case with this next assignment. My hope is that you will find it as challenging as I did.</p>

<p>The back story is that I was in Iceland recently and found myself at the famous iceberg beach, an experience to which I had looked forward for years. Unfortunately, the photo gods had a good laugh that day and presented us with hurricane force winds. So, once out of the car I knew that I would be unable to change lenses. I had to choose only one lens, a terrible predicament for a professional photographer. Should I shoot long or short, zoom or prime?</p>

<h3>Your Assignment Beckons</h3>


<p>This assignment runs the risk of driving even the most able photographer crazy. Pick only one lens, preferably a wide-angle prime lens (meaning a lens with only one focal length). Now go out and shoot with it. There are tons of lessons to learn with this exercise, probably the most important of all how to crop your scene in the camera. Instead of zooming in and out you’ll have to haul your butt back and forth to capture the scene you envision. Some of my best shots have been taken when I’ve left a needed lens home and am forced to shoot with the “wrong” lens. In the case of my Iceland iceberg experience, I chose a prime (my 28mm Hasselblad lens, fitted with a tilt-shift mechanism, making it effectively a 42mm lens&#8230; in 35mm format that would be equivalent to a 33mm lens) and came away with some images I liked. If I had the luxury of choices that evening, I most probably would have chosen my 50-110mm Hasselblad zoom, focused on the icebergs themselves and missed the wider beach shots that gave my images context, texture and mood.</p>

<p><a href="http://blog.lesterpickerphoto.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/05/A0020163-as-Smart-Object-1.jpg"><img class="alignnone size-medium wp-image-2226" title="Iceland icebergs" src="http://blog.lesterpickerphoto.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/05/A0020163-as-Smart-Object-1-300x225.jpg" alt="" width="300" height="225"></a></p>

<p><strong>Variation</strong>. If you do not own a prime lens, restrict yourself to one zoom lens, BUT keep it on ONE zoom setting.</p>

<h3>Telephoto Only</h3>


<p>Now, on a separate outing, try just the opposite. Go with a telephoto only. In the image below I shot the Grand Canyon with a telephoto lens, rather than the standard wide-angle lens that most everyone else uses there. The back story is that I was exhausted after a day of climbing and frankly did not have the energy to take off my pack, change lenses or camera bodies, reframe and shoot. Still, I was happy with this image, which is fundamentally the opposite of what most people try to capture at the Grand Canyon.</p>

		  <div class="entry-content"><p>Iceland: Favorite Places to Stay</p>

<p>After 16 days spent here, I’ve experienced many types of lodging in Iceland. Some are of the more common hotel type, while others are farms or homes converted or adapted to tourist trade use. Lodging options are sorely needed in Iceland, as the tiny population of 320,000 must cater to more than 500,00 tourists annually (and growing).</p>

<p>First, a few things to know about touring in Iceland. Every place I stayed had wireless Internet capability. Only one place charged for it, but the fee was nominal- less than a US dollar an hour.</p>

<p>Hotels are… well, hotels. They mostly offer all expected amenities, even small gyms in some cases. Iceland also offers a wonderful option for tourists, and one I highly recommend. It is called Icelandic Farm Holidays (<a href="http://www.farmholidays.is">www.farmholidays.is</a>). These include more than 150 farmhouses, guesthouses, country hotels and cottages.</p>

<p>I found every single one of these accommodations to be excellent. They were clean and tidy and very welcoming. The big plus is that you get to meet, talk with and share laughs with the local proprietors.</p>

<p>A few cautionary notes. Bring your own shampoo. Most accommodations include a soap dispenser in the shower, but no shampoo. Bring disposable washcloths, available at online travel sites. Few accommodations offer them. And then there are breakfasts. Leave your scrambled eggs and bacon preferences at home. Here you will find an incredibly standardized breakfast throughout the country. Cold cereals, hard boiled eggs, cheese, breads, sliced meats, and some pastries. The breakfasts are plentiful and hearty, but not what most North Americans expect.</p>

<p>Finally, touring in Iceland is easy. The main roads are paved and well maintained. However, if you plan to take gravel roads (there are many of them) or go into mountainous areas, you must have  4-wheel vehicle. If you are caught driving non-4-wheel drive on these restricted roads you pay a hefty fine. Having said that, I did rent a 4-wheel drive and found exploring these side roads a heck of a lot of fun. They also offered tons of photographic opportunities.</p>

<p><strong>Hotel Keflavik</strong>. After a long flight from abroad, I suggest at least one night in Keflavik, where the international airport is located. Hotel Keflavik (<a href="http://www.hotelkeflavik.is/en">http://www.hotelkeflavik.is/en</a>) offers very comfortable rooms, an excellent, expansive  breakfast, and a gym with sauna and massage service. The staff is helpful and knowledgeable (thanks, Ella and Anna). It’s the perfect way to recover. I suggest you spend an extra night and tour the peninsula on which the hotel is located, especially the ancient fishing site of Selatangar. There are some great photographic locations there and all along the loop. You could easily spend 2 days exploring (I did!).</p>

<p><a href="http://blog.lesterpickerphoto.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/05/DSC_2381.jpg"><img class="size-medium wp-image-2211 " title="DSC_2381" src="http://blog.lesterpickerphoto.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/05/DSC_2381-300x200.jpg" alt="" width="300" height="200"></a></p>

<p><strong>Bogarnes Bed and Breakfast</strong>. I did a separate review of this precious little B&amp;B here. En route to the Snaefellsness peninsula you may want to overnight <a href="http://blog.lesterpickerphoto.com/2012/05/09/iceland-a-jewel-in-borgarnes/">here</a>.</p>

<p><strong>Langaholt</strong>. If you visit the Snaefellsnes Peninsula north of Reykjavik, it would be hard for me to imagine anyone who would not love the ambience and comforts of Langaholt <a href="http://www.langaholt.is/Langaholt/EN/Index.aspx">http://www.langaholt.is/Langaholt/EN/Index.aspx</a>). Proprietor Thorkell (“Keli”) Simonarson and his girlfriend Rúna Björg Magnúsdóttir have created a warm, welcoming, funky and completely absorbing guesthouse on a converted farm. Every day during season Keli’s father brings in fresh trout and char from a nearby lake and his mother fillets them and serves them immediately for breakfast or dinner (<a href="http://youtu.be/1bSYaSZHzu4">this video is a must watch</a>!). Their artist friend Thordis Claessen has adorned their walls with some very unusual images reflecting local mythology. Langaholt also features a small golf course located right on their oceanfront property.</p>

<p><a href="http://blog.lesterpickerphoto.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/05/A0020455.jpg"><img class="size-medium wp-image-2212" title="A0020455" src="http://blog.lesterpickerphoto.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/05/A0020455-300x225.jpg" alt="" width="300" height="225"></a></p>

<p><strong>Hotel Hellnar</strong>. For a more upscale experience, try Hotel Hellnar (<a href="http://www.hellnar.is">http://www.hellnar.is</a>/), at the foot of the Snaefellsjokull glacier and right on the ocean. One of four family owned and managed hotels on the peninsula, you’ll find fine dining and immaculate rooms. The Hotel is near to many photographic sites, including a lighthouse with attendant rocky shore, and a magnificent geological formation. Old, abandoned farmhouses can also be photographed.</p>

<p><a href="http://blog.lesterpickerphoto.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/05/A0020568.jpg"><img class="size-medium wp-image-2213 " title="A0020568" src="http://blog.lesterpickerphoto.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/05/A0020568-300x225.jpg" alt="" width="300" height="225"></a></p>

<p><strong>Guesthouse Steig</strong>. If you drive east along the spectacularly gorgeous south coast, then you’ll want to stay at Guesthouse Steig ( <a href="http://guesthousesteig.is/Home/Rooms/">http://guesthousesteig.is/Home/Rooms/</a>), a real working sheep farm. Here Ausrun Guthmundsdottir and her husband Olafur Stigsson have built a separate guesthouse with spotlessly clean and comfortable rooms. Ausrun’s marvelous Icelandic sheep dog and two house dogs are a definite plus, but I’ll always remember Asrun’s friendliness and her wonderful hugs. While you are there, remember to ask her to show you the jar of volcanic ash she has saved from the latest eruption.</p>

<p><a href="http://blog.lesterpickerphoto.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/05/A0019880.jpg"><img class="size-medium wp-image-2216" title="A0019880" src="http://blog.lesterpickerphoto.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/05/A0019880-225x300.jpg" alt="" width="225" height="300"></a></p>

<p><strong>Hali Farm</strong>. This guesthouse/farm is the hardest accommodation for me to describe. First, Hali (<a href="http://hali.is">http://hali.is</a>/) is a working farm, with more than 150 sheep and 30 milking cows. Plus, it raises more than 250,000 char in its aquaculture operation (talk about fresh fish for dinner!).  Hali is also a community of people dedicated to the ideals of its relative Thorbergur Thordarson, one of Iceland’s most famous writers, philosophers and naturalists.</p>

<p>The farm includes a wonderful museum that houses a collection of Thordarson’s writing, but also interesting educational and interactive exhibits of life in Iceland several generations ago.</p>

<p><a href="http://blog.lesterpickerphoto.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/05/photo2.jpg"><img class="size-medium wp-image-2215" title="photo" src="http://blog.lesterpickerphoto.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/05/photo2-300x225.jpg" alt="" width="300" height="225"></a></p>

<p>The guesthouse itself is a collection of separate buildings, with clean, comfortable rooms and views of the ocean and mountains. The dining room is open for breakfast and dinner. I recommend the fresh char dinner.</p>

<p>The farmhouse is close to the iceberg lagoon dear to the heart of photographers. Just make sure that you visit across the road to the ocean side, where stranded bergs are a delight to capture on sensor or film. Be sure to dress warmly.</p>

		  <div class="entry-content"><p>I have come to find out that religion is a funny sort of thing in Iceland. While most Icelanders identify themselves as Christian, a 2011 Gallup poll found that 60% of them do not feel religion is important in their lives. That&#8217;s one of the highest percentage of irreverent believers in the world.</p>

<p>Most Icelanders are of the Lutheran denomination, although few actually attend church any more on a regular basis. Paganism, or more accurately naturism, is still practiced by many. Still, Iceland is dotted with almost as many churches as waterfalls (an exaggeration, of course, since Iceland has far, far more waterfalls than churches).</p>

<p><a href="http://blog.lesterpickerphoto.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/05/A0019323.jpg"><img class="size-medium wp-image-2201 " title="A0019323" src="http://blog.lesterpickerphoto.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/05/A0019323-300x225.jpg" alt="" width="300" height="225"></a></p>

<p>Most of the churches are tiny affairs, built for yesterday&#8217;s agrarian population, where  family gathered to celebrate their faith. Today, these churches sit empty and may return to use a few times each year when family gathers again for holidays.</p>

<p><a href="http://blog.lesterpickerphoto.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/05/A0020325.jpg"><img class="size-medium wp-image-2202" title="A0020325" src="http://blog.lesterpickerphoto.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/05/A0020325-300x225.jpg" alt="" width="300" height="225"></a></p>

<p>Nearly every church is built in the same style; simple, trim, even austere. And while there are abandoned and tumble-down farm buildings throughout Iceland, I never once saw a church in a state of disrepair. Both church and its cemetery, always walled with stone or fencing, were meticulously maintained.</p>

<p>Once in a while I passed a more modern rendition of  a church, where the architect was daring enough to change just a roofline to achieve an effect without assaulting the Icelandic sensibility.</p>

<p><a href="http://blog.lesterpickerphoto.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/05/A0019652.jpg"><img class="size-medium wp-image-2203 " title="A0019652" src="http://blog.lesterpickerphoto.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/05/A0019652-300x225.jpg" alt="" width="300" height="225"></a></p>

<p>A quote from the famous Icelandic writer, naturalist and philosopher Thorbergur Thordarson I think sums it up for a large swath of Icelanders:</p>

<p>&#8220;<em>This little bowl of a valley was elongated and lay right under the sky-I often saw sheep there. How I envied these animals in the sunshine and warmth of summer. Or, if I was supposed to go out and bring in dung for fuel or harvest the hay when a great deal needed to get finished. I would pray fervently to God to turn me into a sheep up in Slettibotn, though I wanted to turn back into a human before slaughter time. But God never heeded my prayers, either about this or anything else, which is why our ways parted early in my life.</em>&#8221;</p>

<p>In all cases, I have to say, I found that the church structures complemented the natural environment, adding a point-counterpoint, human-nature effect to the landscape. In any event, they were fun to photograph and I look forward to my next visit to Iceland to spend more time exploring their photographic possibilities.</p>

		  <div class="entry-content"><p>For the past few days, I&#8217;ve been battling severe windy conditions here in Iceland. By severe I&#8217;m talking gale force to hurricane force winds. If there is anything that a photographer hates most it is wind. The skies can be blue, the clouds picturesque, the scene illuminated with golden light. But if the wind is blowing, it&#8217;s hard to stay steady enough to capture a good image. How, then, do the pros do it.</p>

<p>The following image was taken, believe it or not, on a freezing cold beach on Iceland&#8217;s south coast, with the winds blowing at hurricane force (that&#8217;s 70+ miles per hour)! Click on the image to enlarge it.</p>

<p><a href="http://blog.lesterpickerphoto.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/05/A00201851.jpg"><img class="alignnone size-medium wp-image-2192" title="A0020185" src="http://blog.lesterpickerphoto.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/05/A00201851-300x225.jpg" alt="" width="300" height="225"></a></p>

<p>My colleague and I sat in our vehicle for ten minutes, looking over the spectacular black sand beach, the icebergs in the water being buffeted by giant waves, and nature&#8217;s fury lashing at the waves head on. Should we chance it or not. We discussed the pros and cons and for a second or two I had the 4-wheel in reverse, ready to leave. But the failing light of day convinced us to at least give it a try.</p>

<p>Bundled up, we trudged the 150 yards to the shoreline, the wind lashing our backs with grains of sand. Our most immediate concern was with our gear, which we protected as best we could, helped by the fact that the wind was on our backs and not sand-blasting our lenses.</p>

<p>The secret was to stay low, tripod legs extended to provide a stable base. In winds I typically hang my backpack from the hook on the underside of my tripod to add mass and stability. In this case I wanted to use a low ISO to show movement in the water and to highlight the dark sands. For you photography nuts out there, my equipment included a Hasselblad H4D-50, 50-110mm lens set at 95mm, an aperture of f18 and a shutter speed of 1/2 second, using a cable release. I also had a polarizing filter on the front of the lens both to decrease shutter speed so I&#8217;d get movement but also, truth be told, to protect my lens just in case.</p>

<p>This is only one of a series of images I took. It is not processed at all (I am still on the road in Iceland). I just wanted to illustrate a point about photographing in wind.</p>

<p>This next image I took on a stop the very next day, with the winds still at gale force. This small waterfall beckoned from the road as I passed and so I put on my wool hat, wind parka and hood and gloves and set up next to the falls. Again, I stayed low, spread out my tripod legs, hung my pack from the center hook and shot away. I also took a panorama of this falls, which I hope to share with you in the next month or so in a blog I&#8217;ll do on panorama shooting. The equipment was the same as above, but I shot it at ISO 50, f11, 1/3 second to show water flow.</p>

<p><a href="http://blog.lesterpickerphoto.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/05/A0020289.jpg"><img class="alignnone size-medium wp-image-2193" title="A0020289" src="http://blog.lesterpickerphoto.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/05/A0020289-300x225.jpg" alt="" width="300" height="225"></a></p>

<p>Normally, in winds you want to shoot at as fast a shutter speed as possible in order to minimize shake and blurring. But I was faced with the conundrum of wanting to shoot slow to soften the water. My point here is that even this can be done if you pay attention to basics; a sturdy tripod with cable release, good technique and, most importantly, perseverance.</p>

<p>If you&#8217;d like to follow my tracks in Iceland in real time, <a href="http://share.findmespot.com/shared/faces/viewspots.jsp?glId=0Zg1LmM9KoFvIGRUsieGHuXYN1cCXNV5a">go to my personal SPOT GPS page</a>, where you will see where I am, the topography and even a satellite image of the area.</p>

		  <div class="entry-content"><p>I&#8217;m constantly in awe as I travel the Ring Road around Iceland. For one thing, I can&#8217;t drive for a mile without seeing a waterfall, whether up close and personal or in the distance. At one point I counted six waterfalls in one view.</p>

<p>Iceland has to be a geologist&#8217;s or a vulcanologist&#8217;s Valhalla. And if not seeing waterfalls, one is nearly always in sight of a glacier. Some sit atop Iceland&#8217;s many mountains. Others have accumulated enough mass to advance down valleys in their unstoppable flow to the sea.</p>

<p>Iceland&#8217;s glaciers are both magnificent and frightening. As the glaciers advance, they scour the land before them, toppling trees, grinding boulders to gravel, and pushing millions of tons of earth before them like a bulldozer. Here is a scene at the Svinafellsjokull glacier along the south coast of the island, showing the advancing edge of the glacier with some of the earth it has scoured in its path.</p>

<p><a href="http://blog.lesterpickerphoto.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/05/A0020105.jpg"><img class="size-medium wp-image-2182 " title="A0020105" src="http://blog.lesterpickerphoto.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/05/A0020105-300x225.jpg" alt="" width="300" height="225"></a></p>

<p><a href="http://www.hartmier.com">Richard Hartmier</a>, my photo buddy from Yukon, Canada, and I stopped at the glacier for a photo shoot. The wind was blowing mightily and we had been warned that a storm was approaching. Richard went off on his own to photograph the icebergs that slough off the glacier and accumulate in a deep meltwater pond in front of it. I chose to climb the ledges on the left side of the glacier that you see in this picture.</p>

<p><a href="http://blog.lesterpickerphoto.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/05/A0020125.jpg"><img class="size-medium wp-image-2183 " title="A0020125" src="http://blog.lesterpickerphoto.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/05/A0020125-300x225.jpg" alt="" width="300" height="225"></a></p>

<p>I managed to get a semblance of the shot I was looking for, but not without some drama. The winds were gale force, so I opened my tripod as wide as the narrow ledge permitted me to in order to stabilize my setup. I took off my backpack, which weighs about 30 pounds, and hooked it to the underpart of the tripod to add mass and further stabilize it. I began to shoot, but the winds suddenly picked up to hurricane force (75+ mph), nearly toppling my tripod and ripping my neutral density filters from my hand. At that time it was quits for me and I struggled to get my gear packed without being blown over the precipice. I would have liked to stay longer, even climbing higher to get rid of the rock on the left side of the image and getting a view of the entire snow-capped mountain, but I also wanted to live to tell about it, so prudence won out. In this image you can see the winds blasting snow from the glacial pack and barreling them down the valley.</p>

<p><a href="http://blog.lesterpickerphoto.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/05/A0020117.jpg"><img class="size-medium wp-image-2184" title="A0020117" src="http://blog.lesterpickerphoto.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/05/A0020117-300x225.jpg" alt="" width="300" height="225"></a></p>

<p>To give you all an idea of how strong the wind was, I did <a href="http://youtu.be/WQ8WKOsLjsA">a tiny video clip</a> of Richard when we stopped at another part of the glacier. Now Richard is not a little guy and he was almost toppled by the gusts at various points during the day.</p>

		  <div class="entry-content"><p>One of the joys of driving around Iceland is that you won’t drive far without seeing a waterfall (&#8216;foss&#8217; in Icelandic). I don’t mean piddly little falls. In Iceland, nearly every falls is a major gusher, whether in height or volume (hydropower supplies 70% of the electricity in Iceland, with geothermal the remaining 30%).</p>

<p><a href="http://blog.lesterpickerphoto.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/05/A0019866.jpg"><img class="size-medium wp-image-2174" title="A0019866" src="http://blog.lesterpickerphoto.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/05/A0019866-300x225.jpg" alt="" width="300" height="225"></a></p>

<p>Instead of ranting on about the incredible waterfalls, I’ll give you some quick examples. The short video clips were taken with my iPhone 4S.</p>

<p><a href="http://blog.lesterpickerphoto.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/05/A0019898.jpg"><img class="size-medium wp-image-2175" title="A0019898" src="http://blog.lesterpickerphoto.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/05/A0019898-225x300.jpg" alt="" width="225" height="300"></a></p>

<p><a href="http://youtu.be/wrxp8M7oSQo">This is a smaller waterfall</a> I came across while visiting a historic site. The falls was mostly hidden by a rocky berm, but as I drove I noticed a flash of light that I thought might be a falls. We ended up hiking a fair distance to reach it, but it was worth it as we photographed it for more than an hour.</p>

<p>This next falls is one of the most famous in Iceland. <a href="http://youtu.be/PwQcdioEJbs">Known as Gullfoss</a>, it has more water flowing than Niagara Falls in upstate New York in the United States. The sound as you approach it can be intimidating, but once you see its massive power and glorious structure, you can&#8217;t help but be wowed.</p>

<p>My colleague, Richard Hartmier, and I will be visiting other major falls in Iceland, so stay tuned.</p>

		  <div class="entry-content"><p>Photographing around Iceland, I&#8217;m struck by the incredible number of geysers dotting the landscape. These miracles of geology just steam out of the ground in the midst of fields and mountains.</p>

<p>Iceland is a geologically active island, as we all know from one of the more recent eruptions two years ago that made worldwide news and grounded commercial air traffic for weeks. I can remember back in the seventies when the island of Surtsey suddenly emerged from the ocean off the Icelandic coast.</p>

<p>The Icelanders have ingeniously tapped into its proliferation of geysers and uses volcanic steam and heat to provide nearly all the island&#8217;s electricity needs.</p>

<p>In Seltun, there is a wonderful self-guided tourist park that winds through an active geyser field.</p>

<p><a href="http://blog.lesterpickerphoto.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/05/CameraAwesomePhoto3.jpg"><img class="size-medium wp-image-2168" title="CameraAwesomePhoto" src="http://blog.lesterpickerphoto.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/05/CameraAwesomePhoto3-300x225.jpg" alt="" width="300" height="225"></a></p>

<p>Here is an example of <a href="http://youtu.be/VcMdq4XrkxY">a typical geyser field</a> (taken with my iPhone).</p>

<p>In some instances, due to constrictions in the gases&#8217; ability to escape, pressure builds up and the geysers erupt in spectacular fashion. Of course Americans are familiar with this phenomenon in the form of Old Faithful in Yellowstone National Park. In Iceland <a href="http://youtu.be/YPjMWxEsUX8">here is a geyser eruption</a> I recorded.</p>

<p>In any event, it is a strange and exciting phenomenon to an east coast American, like me.</p>

		  <div class="entry-content"><p>Good news! My lost luggage was returned to me, two days late but otherwise unharmed. I’m a happy camper now that I have my long johns, ScotteVest fleece and jacket, hat gloves and other necessities for photographing in Iceland.</p>

<p>After two days roaming around the Kaflavik airport area and shooting handheld because my tripod was in my misplaced luggage, we took off today for the Snaefellsnes peninsula, which is northwest of the capital city of Reykjavik (pronounced Rake-a-vik). It is a gorgeous area, dotted with immense lava fields from the many eruptions that shaped the Iceland of today (and continue to shape it). The peninsula is dominated by the impressive Snaefellsjokull glacier in the center of a huge national park.</p>

<p><a href="http://blog.lesterpickerphoto.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/05/A0019482-Panorama.jpg"><img class="size-medium wp-image-2151" title="A0019482 Panorama" src="http://blog.lesterpickerphoto.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/05/A0019482-Panorama-300x66.jpg" alt="" width="300" height="66"></a></p>

<p>The peninsula juts out into the frigid north Atlantic ocean. Here, in May, the temperatures are cold and the wind a steady presence as the landscape soaks in the precious sun that now shines for 20 hours. I captured the scene of the glacier you see above at approximately 10:30 last night. It requires several layers of clothing to be able to stay out for hours photographing the landscape, especially near the water. But the rewards are many.</p>

<p>Here is a jpeg version of a 3-photo panorama I took of an interesting phenomenon that I’ve not seen anywhere else in my travels. In many places along the southern coast and the Snaefellsnes peninsula (and perhaps elsewhere but I’ve not been there yet), the lava has been colonized by a deep carpet of moss. The moss is luxurious. Wherever I pressed down with my hand it would depress a good four to six inches. These blankets of moss go on for miles.</p>

<p>If you’d like to follow my tracks around Iceland (I use the SPOT GPS system just in case I have a mishap), <a href="http://share.findmespot.com/shared/faces/viewspots.jsp?glId=0Zg1LmM9KoFvIGRUsieGHuXYN1cCXNV5a">click on this link</a> and it will take you to my personal travel page, where you’ll see a map of Iceland with my position in real time. You can magnify the map to see the terrain, roads and a satellite view. Pretty neat technology.</p>

		  <div class="entry-content"><p>For those of you who are veteran travelers, you know the perils of finding a decent place to lodge. There are the plastic hotels, the nightmare B&amp;Bs, the $25 Internet surcharges, even bedbugs! So, when I travel and find a clean, quiet, fair-priced place to lodge, I consider it a gift.</p>

<p>The Borgarnes Bed and Breakfast in Borgarnes, Iceland is one such gift. It is nothing short of a jewel in a treasure chest of eye candy that is Iceland (at least for us photography types). Arriving exhausted after a full day&#8217;s shooting, my colleague Richard and I were more than pleasantly surprised to check in with the owner, Inger Helkadottir, a retired sheep farmer. Inger runs an immaculately clean house, that manages to radiate warmth.</p>

<p><a href="http://blog.lesterpickerphoto.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/05/photo1.jpg"><img class="size-medium wp-image-2157" title="photo" src="http://blog.lesterpickerphoto.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/05/photo1-300x225.jpg" alt="" width="300" height="225"></a></p>

<p>Outwardly unassuming, the B&amp;B sits on a ledge overlooking the harbor and the Northern Atlantic beyond. The rooms are spacious by European standards. The shared bathroom is kept spotless. Fresh towels and washcloths, as well as comfortable bathrobes are provided.</p>

<p>There is a comfortable sitting room with to-die-for views of the harbor and rocky, bird-filled islets. The house sits at the end of a quiet street, so we each had  a blissfully restful sleep.</p>

<p><a href="http://blog.lesterpickerphoto.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/05/photo-copy.jpg"><img class="size-medium wp-image-2158 " title="photo copy" src="http://blog.lesterpickerphoto.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/05/photo-copy-300x225.jpg" alt="" width="300" height="225"></a></p>

<p>Breakfast included pancakes, cereals, cheese, freshly baked whole grain bread (baked by Inger), vegetables, juice, sliced eggs, and fresh jams. In fact, despite our rigorous shooting schedule, Richard and I decided to linger to enjoy the solitude and the views.</p>

<p>If you ever find yourself in Borgarnes, Iceland, this would be a great place to stay. Inger&#8217;s email is: ingerh@internet.is</p>

		  <div class="entry-content"><p>My plane landed in Reykjavik, Iceland, just as the sun was rising, warming the wingtip of my plane and bluing up the skies for which Iceland is famous. I figured it was a wonderful omen for my upcoming 16 days of glorious Icelandic photography.</p>

<p><a href="http://blog.lesterpickerphoto.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/05/photo.jpg"><img class="size-medium wp-image-2145" title="photo" src="http://blog.lesterpickerphoto.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/05/photo-300x225.jpg" alt="" width="300" height="225"></a></p>

<p>WRONG!</p>

<p>I deplaned, went through a police check and sleepily dragged my butt onto a shuttle to the baggage claim area (prior to a customs check). At the carousel I waited and waited as my fellow happy passengers retrieved their bags and sauntered outside. As for me&#8230; no luggage! It&#8217;s a Saturday morning and while inconvenient and a blow to my photography assignment, I figured, okay, I can deal with this for a day. But, no, it turns out that the next plane from Toronto does not arrive until Monday! Major bummer.</p>

<p>My photo colleague, Richard Hartmier, and I could not do much all day because my jacket, warm clothes, tripod and several key pieces of my equipment are in my two checked bags. It is beautiful today, with clear, blue skies, but it is also cold and very windy, so I could not tolerate being outdoors for more than a few minutes at a time. And without a tripod, a shivering landscape photographer is pretty much dead in the water.</p>

<p>So, here I am, one very frustrated photographer, still waiting to tackle Iceland&#8217;s spectacular landscapes.</p>

		  <div class="entry-content"><p>I leave tomorrow for a 16-day photo exploration of Iceland. I&#8217;ll be accompanied by my good friend and fellow professional photographer, the curmudgeonly <a href="http://www.hartmier.com">Richard Hartmier</a>, of Yukon Territory, Canada. We have a 4-wheel vehicle reserved, but not even one place to lodge. Our plan is to rent some sleeping bags, a propane stove for coffee in the morning, a cooler for some food, and just take off for wherever our cameras point.  If we end up in one place for a few days we&#8217;ll book into a hotel or B&amp;B, but our mission is unadulterated photography. Sunrise photography, mid-day photography, sunset photography and star trails (and even, God willing, an errant aurora) photography at night.</p>

<p>Richard and I have together traveled the back, rutty roads up north of the Arctic Circle and <a href="http://blog.lesterpickerphoto.com/2011/08/28/the-bear-truth-and-other-musings/">hunted bears with our cameras in Alaska</a>. Once, in the Yukon, we were even <a href="http://blog.lesterpickerphoto.com/2011/09/02/close-encounters-of-the-bear-kind/">pestered by a grizzly while photographing</a>. Richard, of course, ran for the safety of his vehicle, leaving me and my camera gear to fend for ourselves. I jumped into his truck shortly after, and scrambled across his lap to safety. I&#8217;ve forgiven Richard; that&#8217;s the kind of guy I am. Richard, on the other hand, calls me a liar, since his version of the story differs just a tad from mine. I accept Richard&#8217;s delusions and his character flaws, plus Iceland has very few bears (just an occasional misguided polar bear), so I agreed to travel with him, even against my better judgment.</p>

<p><a href="http://blog.lesterpickerphoto.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/05/Hartmier.jpg"><img class="size-medium wp-image-2136 " title="Hartmier" src="http://blog.lesterpickerphoto.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/05/Hartmier-199x300.jpg" alt="" width="199" height="300"></a></p>

<p>Anyway, I look on this as an adventure. I will be using my SPOT Interactive GPS toy, so those of you who are interested can <a href="http://share.findmespot.com/shared/faces/viewspots.jsp?glId=0Zg1LmM9KoFvIGRUsieGHuXYN1cCXNV5a">follow my tracks</a> throughout the day or day to day. SPOT sends a signal to a satellite that relays them in real time to a computer. When you visit the site - beginning Saturday, May 5-  you&#8217;ll <a href="http://share.findmespot.com/shared/faces/viewspots.jsp?glId=0Zg1LmM9KoFvIGRUsieGHuXYN1cCXNV5a">see a map of the region and a dot where I am and have recently been</a>. If nothing else, it&#8217;ll be a fun geography lesson as we circle the island.</p>

<p>I&#8217;ll try to blog here and there when Internet connections permit. For now, Iceland Ho!</p>

		  <div class="entry-content"><p>It took a while, but we finally purchased a brand spanking new large format printer, the Epson 9900. Here it is, after being installed in our office today:</p>

<p><a href="http://blog.lesterpickerphoto.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/05/CameraAwesomePhoto1.jpg"><img class="size-medium wp-image-2131" title="CameraAwesomePhoto" src="http://blog.lesterpickerphoto.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/05/CameraAwesomePhoto1-300x224.jpg" alt="" width="300" height="224"></a></p>

<p>Bob Boyer, my very able assistant and master of all things tech, helped me over the past few months deciding on what printer to buy. We narrowed the choices to two excellent products, the Canon ipf8300 and the Epson 9900. Since the Epson was newer, with a tad more advanced technology, we went with it.</p>

<p>It took six men to carry it up the stairs to my office. The damn thing weighed 417 pounds coming off the truck and more than 300 pounds after we tok off all the packaging and component parts. But with the very first test print we were sold (again) and knew we made the right choice.</p>

<p>The printer is extremely user-friendly, with a  display that is easy to read and understand. After we assembled the printer, inserted the 11 ink cartridges and revved it up, our first 8.5&#8221; x 11&#8221; print was right on the money. The second was a 40&#8221; x 30&#8221; monster that was spot on. Ah, love at first sight!</p>

<p><a href="http://blog.lesterpickerphoto.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/05/CameraAwesomePhoto2.jpg"><img class="size-medium wp-image-2142" title="CameraAwesomePhoto" src="http://blog.lesterpickerphoto.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/05/CameraAwesomePhoto2-300x224.jpg" alt="" width="300" height="224"></a></p>

<p>I took the picture of the print with my iPhone. The print was made on the el cheapo paper that comes with the printer for testing purposes. In the future I&#8217;ll take pictures with a better camera of images we print on high quality paper so you can judge the quality of the 9900 for yourself.</p>

<p>Up until today we had been using an HP B9180 that only allowed us to print at 13&#8221; x 19&#8221; maximum. All our large prints were sent out for processing. I find that a real pain, since I have to make sure that the lab&#8217;s color profiles match our own. That typically means two or three back-and-forth volleys with proofs and even then I was sometimes dissatisfied. Also, the labs sometimes did not offer our preferred archival photo papers, such as the exquisite Museo Silver Rag. Suddenly we are able to print 44&#8221; wide and up to 100 feet long!!</p>

<p>The fact is that our HP was also extremely finicky, and that convinced us that we needed a better alternative. At the same time, I was selected to be the exclusive artist for Sinai Hospital&#8217;s (Baltimore) new wing, slated to open in October. We will need 75-100 large prints for that installation, so that launched us on a search for a large format printer. Having our own large format printer will also allow us to expand our Limited Edition prints and will allow me to personally guarantee that each and every print will be of the absolutely highest quality.</p>

<p>I will keep you posted as we put the Epson 9900 through its paces. Right now it is looking good.</p>

		  <div class="entry-content"><p>It’s a truism among photographers that what separates a professional from an amateur is that the pro knows when NOT to take a picture. That’s not to say that I haven’t taken some bonehead images when I knew they wouldn’t come out. But the more experience I have earned, the less often that has happened.</p>

<p>What brings this up is that I was recently on a bus tour, where there was also a very avid amateur photographer with a nice Nikon camera system and a couple of lenses. Since I always sat in the back of the bus so as not to disturb the other tourists with all my gear, I found myself watching her photographic activity with keen interest.</p>

<p>First of all, she had her camera with her at all times, even placing it on the table in front of her during all meal times. I can hardly remember what her face looks like because I rarely saw it without the camera blocking it. She must have shot thousands upon thousands of images. At one point I asked her what percentage of the images she took she would typically consider good.</p>

<p>“Oh, maybe one percent,” she told me.</p>

<p>The other thing she did was constantly take pictures from the moving bus, no matter how rutted the road and how much we shook. At times she was nearly toppling over, but still firing away. When we were stopped, with the bus idling, she would brace the camera on the seat in front of her and shoot away.</p>

<p><a href="http://blog.lesterpickerphoto.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/05/CameraAwesomePhoto.jpg"><img class="size-medium wp-image-2125" title="CameraAwesomePhoto" src="http://blog.lesterpickerphoto.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/05/CameraAwesomePhoto-300x224.jpg" alt="" width="300" height="224"></a></p>

<p>The point I’d like to make here is that a photographer should know the limits of his or her equipment. If you are shooting 100 images to get one decent one, then something is wrong. Doing more of the exact same thing and expecting different results is not rational.</p>

<p>So, one piece of advice I would give to those of you who travel by bus or train is to either forget photographing while the vehicle is moving, or else make radical changes in your camera, lenses and settings to have even a slim chance of getting something worth keeping (please see my previous blog on <a href="http://blog.lesterpickerphoto.com/2010/08/17/train-photography/">train photography</a>). First of all, photographing through dusty, dirty windows is not a recipe for success.And moving at 50 mph in a vibrating, rocking and rolling hunk of steel and expecting to get sharp images is also not realistic.</p>

<p>If you do want to try photographing from a bus/train, here is what I recommend. First, try to clean the windows before the vehicle leaves, especially on bus tours. Next, boost your ISO and open up your lens to f5.6 or so, in order to get much faster shutter speeds. That will minimize, but will probably not eliminate, blur. Of course, intentional blur might actually make a good image (again, see <a href="http://blog.lesterpickerphoto.com/2010/08/17/train-photography/">train photography</a>).</p>

<p>When the bus is stopped, but still idling, you should not rest your camera on the seat for stability. The bus is vibrating and will actually make it more difficult to get a decent image. Instead, hold your camera with your elbows at your side and shoot. That allows your body to act as a shock absorber. Not perfect, but a better alternative.</p>

<p>As far as the larger issue of shooting scads of pictures to get one decent one goes, here’s my advice, even if you did not ask for it. Try to improve your skills. Read photo books and magazines. Browse the Internet, pick a few good photo sites, visit often and pay attention. The best way to learn I have found is to take a photo workshop. But, please don’t expect your photography to improve by doing more of what hasn’t worked for you so far.</p>

		  <div class="entry-content"><p>by <strong><a href="http://www.darwinwiggett.com">Darwin Wiggett</a></strong></p>

<p><strong><em>Les&#8217; Note: I am so pleased to offer you, my regular blog readers, this guest blog by my colleague, Darwin Wiggett. Darwin is one of Canada&#8217;s top professional landscape/nature photographers and a man whose body of work I have admired for years. His creativity and passion never cease to amaze me. Enjoy!</em></strong></p>

<p>Musicians have scales, actors have lines, painters have sketches, and athletes have workouts. Photographers have what? While all other artists have a daily routine to practice their craft, most photographers only dust off the camera when they go on a planned shoot. Imagine if musicians only played whenever they had a gig and did not practice in the time in between—can you imagine the results? Why, as photographers, do we expect that we will perform wonderfully every time we go out even without practicing in between?</p>

<p>Nothing will sharpen both your technical skills and your artistic eye faster than daily practice. Visual ‘scales’ do for the photographer what musical scales do for the musician; we constantly stay ‘tuned’ up and ready to express our art.</p>

<p>I know we all have really busy lives, so who has time to shoot every day? You might think it’s easy for me as a professional photographer to shoot daily&#8211;after all that is my job isn’t it? But to make it as a pro, you need to do some heavy marketing and selling. I only get to go on photo shoots about 1/3<sup>rd</sup> of the time, the other 2/3<sup>rd</sup> is spent doing the business part of photography (yech!). In the past, I found that between shoots I was not practicing with my camera and that my art was suffering. It often took 2 or 3 days into a trip to get back into ‘seeing’. I was not practiced and ready.</p>

<p><a href="http://blog.lesterpickerphoto.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/04/NMP12726.jpg"><img class="size-medium wp-image-2119 " title="NMP.tif" src="http://blog.lesterpickerphoto.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/04/NMP12726-300x225.jpg" alt="" width="300" height="225"></a></p>

<p>For the last two or three years I have begun to carry a small point-n-shoot digital camera with me everywhere I go. I do not have to carve out special time to shoot daily; I just take a snapshot here and there in my day as I see something interesting. I might be walking the dog, or standing in line at the bank, doing dishes or visiting the washroom. But if something catches my eye, I make an image. Now I am doing a little photography almost every day and the differences I have seen in my ability to see and be creative is amazing. I no longer have any ‘photographer’s block’ and I no longer need to ‘warm up’ before going on a serious photo shoot. I see photos everywhere!</p>

<p><a href="http://blog.lesterpickerphoto.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/04/NMP12081.jpg"><img class="size-medium wp-image-2120" title="NMP.tif" src="http://blog.lesterpickerphoto.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/04/NMP12081-300x195.jpg" alt="" width="300" height="195"></a></p>

<p>Even though I am a nature photographer, anything that catches my eye can become a photo. The great thing about shooting daily is that soon you’ll begin to remove labels from subjects and just learn to see light, pattern, form and design. You’ll see beauty in the mundane, and you’ll be inspired anywhere you go from the park to the parking lot. The better you become at photography in general, the better you’ll be at outdoor photography in particular. So do not restrict yourself to pretty nature scenes.</p>

<p><a href="http://blog.lesterpickerphoto.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/04/NMP10113A.jpg"><img class="size-medium wp-image-2121" title="NMP.tif" src="http://blog.lesterpickerphoto.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/04/NMP10113A-300x228.jpg" alt="" width="300" height="228"></a></p>

<p>Although I have mentioned the wonders of a point-n-shoot camera here before, I really think anyone who is serious about becoming a better photographer should invest in one and carry and use it. You’ll really see the huge benefits of practice. Happy shooting.</p>

		  <div class="entry-content"><p>First, my apologies. I was supposed to announce the winner of our ScotteVest contest last month. Trouble is, I came back from Israel and had a 72-hour turnaround before I left for Sri Lanka for nearly a month, so in my haste I just totally forgot about the contest. An astute reader reminded me of my errant ways and so I&#8217;m writing today to announce the winner of a brand new Classic ScotteVest.</p>

<p>Meet Cate Crandell, who calls Kansas home. I&#8217;ll let her tell her own story:</p>

<p><a href="http://blog.lesterpickerphoto.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/04/photo1.jpg"><img class="size-full wp-image-2107" title="photo" src="http://blog.lesterpickerphoto.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/04/photo1.jpg" alt="" width="180" height="270"></a></p>

<p>&#8220;<em>My love for photography started when I was in high school, and it, coupled with my curiosity about teaching and experiencing cultures, eventually brought me to my current location in Moldova as a volunteer with the Peace Corps. This experience is soon coming to an end, and when it does I will be heading to India and Thailand for a month of photography. By August I hope to be in Austin or back in my hometown of Kansas City, beginning a new career in social marketing and community engagement, while of course always having my camera at my side and   jet setting as much as possible. While researching the best travel clothing for photographers, I was led to Les and his review of the ScotteVest. I cannot wait to try my own, and will of course review it on my blog (<a href="http://www.wherescate.blogspot.com/">www.wherescate.blogspot.com</a>)</em>.&#8221;</p>

<p>I wish Cate the very best and my hat is off to her for serving our country in such a positive way. I know she&#8217;ll love her ScotteVest, just as I love mine.</p>

<p>I also want to thank <a href="http://www.scottevest.com">ScotteVest</a> for sponsoring this contest for my loyal blog followers.</p>

<p>Cate&#8217;s name was chosen completely at random from those people who registered on my blog. If you want to be eligible for future product contests, please register on this blog site right now. It&#8217;s easy!</p>

<p>BTW, you can still &#8220;win&#8221; by using my discount code to save 15% on any ScotteVest product you want. Just go to the right side of the page and click on the discount code box. While I write a regular blog for ScotteVest, I do not make any money from these sales. Just thought you&#8217;d like to know.</p>

		  <div class="entry-content"><p>I’m preparing to leave the lovely country of Sri Lanka after three weeks spent here. Located off the coast of India, with a population of some 21 million, the country is a tourist’s delight. Since the signing of the peace treaty with the terrorist Tamil Tigers two years ago, the country is now focused on developing its infrastructure, which is badly in need of repair (after driving its roads, my back is howling). Sri Lanka, formerly known as Ceylon, means “Pearl of the Indian Ocean” and, believe me, it lives up to its name.</p>

<p>Here, then, are some of my favorite and not so favorite aspects of Sri Lanka for those of you fortunate enough to consider coming here.</p>

<p><strong><em>The People</em></strong>. You will absolutely never find friendlier people anywhere you travel on this planet. As a primarily Buddhist nation, when you greet a person, hands together, you will receive a warm smile. Service in restaurants is fabulous. For photographers, the country is ideal, as nearly everyone agrees to have their photo taken.</p>

<p><a href="http://blog.lesterpickerphoto.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/04/DSC_2126.jpg"><img class="size-medium wp-image-2099" title="DSC_2126" src="http://blog.lesterpickerphoto.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/04/DSC_2126-300x200.jpg" alt="" width="300" height="200"></a></p>

<p><strong><em>Food</em></strong>. Sri Lanka offers a widely diverse menu. I would definitely recommend taking advantage of local foods, such as curries with various rices, all grown in-country. Since many Buddhists are primarily vegetarians, there is an abundance of fresh, colorful, delicious veggies.</p>

<p><strong><em>Photo Opps</em></strong>. Sri Lanka has got to be one of the most photogenic countries on earth, no exaggeration. First, the geography varies from lush mountains in the north to dry desert-like conditions in the south. Second, it has some of the most photographable architecture in the way of its temples and shrines. Third, its wildlife is exceptional, from monkeys to leopards and elephants. Fourth, its people are beautiful, both in looks and spirit, and nearly always willing to allow you to take their picture.</p>

<p><a href="http://blog.lesterpickerphoto.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/04/A0018633.jpg"><img class="size-medium wp-image-2103" title="A0018633" src="http://blog.lesterpickerphoto.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/04/A0018633-232x300.jpg" alt="" width="232" height="300"></a></p>

<p><strong><em>The Geography</em></strong>. In a day’s drive you can go from lush, tropical highlands where Sri Lanka’s finest tea plantations are located, to the forest and flat scrub brush country of Yala National Park. Bring a wide and medium length lens with you (a zoom works fine) and use a polarizer.</p>

<p><strong><em>The Culture</em></strong>. As a Buddhist nation the people have a very patient, gentle attitude toward life. They help each other out. They share their meals with homeless dogs. They support beggars. They go out of their way to cater to guests and are very humbled and contrite when they get it wrong. I celebrated the Buddhist New Year in the private home of a family and was made to feel like a welcomed friend.</p>

<p><strong><em>The Tea</em></strong>. I am an ardent tea drinker, having given up coffee more than 10 years ago. I love the subtle differences between teas. Sri Lanka makes some of the best teas in the world. I had the joy of visiting a tea plantation, as well as a tea factory. (“The coffee is terrible!” was the most common refrain at breakfasts). The tea growing region is just so gorgeous and you are guaranteed to see women picking every day, as Sri Lanka’s climate is ideal for growing the plants.</p>

<p><a href="http://blog.lesterpickerphoto.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/04/A0018845.jpg"><img class="size-medium wp-image-2100" title="A0018845" src="http://blog.lesterpickerphoto.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/04/A0018845-300x225.jpg" alt="" width="300" height="225"></a></p>

<p><strong><em>The Animals</em></strong>. Sri Lanka is a gold mine for animal lovers and photographers. There are several national parks that are home to Sri Lanka’s 6,000 elephants. <a href="http://blog.lesterpickerphoto.com/2012/04/14/sri-lanka%E2%80%99s-incredible-yala-national-park/">Yala National Park</a> is considered one of the top leopard environments on Earth. Bring a telephoto lens with you and a sturdy tripod or beanbag.</p>

<p><a href="http://blog.lesterpickerphoto.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/04/DSC_0307.jpg"><img class="size-medium wp-image-2101" title="DSC_0307" src="http://blog.lesterpickerphoto.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/04/DSC_0307-300x179.jpg" alt="" width="300" height="179"></a></p>

<p><strong><em>Massages</em></strong>. How can you resist a one-hour full body massage for $20-25 USD? Every hotel has Ayurvedic masseuses who will work their magic on those sore muscles.</p>

<p><strong><em>Learning</em></strong>. Sri Lankans are open and willing to share their knowledge and traditions. In fact, they welcome questions, although you may need an interpreter with you (English is now mandatory in schools). The learning extends to the Buddhist and Hindu temples, where people worship openly and where even the monks are eager to answer whatever questions you might have. The history of the nation and its unique architecture offers many learning opportunities. I love the cultural differences that define our behaviors. For one thing, Sri Lankans shake their heads from side to side, rather than up and down, when they mean “okay,” something that takes getting used to. Instead of shaking hands, they hold their hands together and bow slightly in greeting.</p>

<p><strong><em>The Attitude</em></strong>. Perhaps most important is what we can take away form a visit to Sri Lanka. I like to think that it has taught me the value of peaceful co-existence. Buddhists are live-and-let-live kind of folks and that is contagious after a few weeks spent here, especially after leaving America last month in the midst of election season divisiveness, acrimony and polarization. Buddhists, Hindus, Muslims and Christians seem to live together peacefully, even to the point of celebrating each others’ holidays.</p>

<p><a href="http://blog.lesterpickerphoto.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/04/DSC_2124.jpg"><img class="size-medium wp-image-2102" title="DSC_2124" src="http://blog.lesterpickerphoto.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/04/DSC_2124-198x300.jpg" alt="" width="198" height="300"></a></p>

<p>… and some things I don’t like so much</p>

<p><strong><em>Sanitation</em></strong>. First, many Sri Lankans eat with their hands, using their thumb and two fingers to create a ball of rice and curry, for example. You may not see this in hotel restaurants, but in the privacy of their homes (even well-heeled homes) and in local eateries, the traditional continues. I love cultural traditions like these and this would not be so bad if everyone washed before eating, but sadly that is not the case. And most Sri Lankan men, I noted, do not wash after using public restrooms, perhaps because there is often no soap or paper towels and the cloth towels you see hanging in restrooms look like they’e been used by auto mechanics for the past two months. The moral of the story is to carry wipes and hand cleanser with you everywhere.</p>

<p><strong><em>Environment</em></strong>. Sri Lanka is a drop-dead gorgeous country, but it would be a lot more inviting to western tourists if the nascent environmental awareness movement caught hold. Litter is everywhere and there are few organized cleanups. In the south coastal region, hit hard by the 2004 tsunami, that is most noticeable in beaches that are littered with trash.</p>

<p><strong><em>Driving</em></strong>. Scary. You find yourself gripping your seat belt and praying that when the crash occurs, it won’t be too painful. See my <a href="http://blog.lesterpickerphoto.com/2012/04/13/driving-in-sri-lanka-dont/">previous post</a> on this topic.</p>

<p><strong><em>Changes Are Coming</em></strong>. With their war against terrorism behind them, Sri Lanka is ripe for development. Hotels along the beach and near parks are going up. Asian investors are salivating over Sri Lanka’s potential. My fear is that much of the culture, pace and lifestyle will change. My hope is that the Buddhist ethic will survive to create a tourist haven that dares to be different.</p>

		  <div class="entry-content"><p>Nearly every tourist who visits Sri Lanka will also visit Yala National Park. Aside from its Buddhist temples which attract millions of adherents, Yala NP is Sri Lanka’s second largest draw for visitors.</p>

<p>I personally had misgivings about visiting the park, having been on safari in Africa. However, after spending 6 game drives in the park, I’m here to tell you that Yala is a worthwhile, wonderful experience… with some caveats, especially for families with younger children. Please note that I&#8217;m posting this blog while I&#8217;m still in Sri Lanka and so did not have an opportunity to post-process my images. I&#8217;ll post the completed images to <a href="http://www.lesterpickerphoto.com">my gallery website</a> as soon as I can, given my travel schedule.</p>

<h3>Not Your Typical Park</h3>


<p>Yala is huge, with narrow, rutty roads criss-crossing the park. You must enter in an approved jeep. I suggest you make sure you hire a guide that speaks your language better than passably, as you’re bound to have many questions (one precious question I heard from a young girl in a nearby jeep at a watering hole was why that massive bull elephant had two trunks; one dangling from its head and the other between its legs. Mom and Dad had a good time explaining that one!).</p>

<p><a href="http://blog.lesterpickerphoto.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/04/DSC_1547.jpg"><img class="size-medium wp-image-2090" title="DSC_1547" src="http://blog.lesterpickerphoto.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/04/DSC_1547-194x300.jpg" alt="" width="194" height="300"></a></p>

<p>What the narrow roads and forested topography mean is that animal spotting is an active pursuit. It doesn’t just happen. You drive all morning or afternoon to earn your sightings. Most people make two safaris in a day, one in the early morning and the other starting at 3:00 PM until the park closes at six. If you can only do one, do the afternoon where leopard sightings are more common. Do not make the mistake of taking a late morning jeep ride. The animals hide and sleep most of the afternoon due to the heat. However, don’t promise the kids a leopard sighting. One couple I met did eight safaris without spotting one. Leopards are very elusive animals, so count your blessings even if you get a distant sighting.</p>

<p>As a result of the narrow roads and very limited sight lines caused by the forest and shrubs, whenever a leopard is sighted <a href="http://youtu.be/YOKjFdAnd04">masses of jeeps</a> race to the scene and from both road directions. The upshot is a nightmarish traffic jam that can take an hour to clear as jeeps vie for a good spot for their clients. No one is allowed to venture out of the jeep and the jeeps may not leave the road, so it can be terribly frustrating for photographers. Best to have your own jeep for maneuverability and to use that time instead on landscapes or other animals.</p>

<p>In fact, if you are photographer I strongly recommend you take a private jeep tour. I did both the first day and then ended up hiring a private jeep for my remaining visits. Costs are very reasonable for a private jeep (be prepared to bargain). That way you can stop wherever you like. But you will not be able to get out of the jeep anywhere within the park. That is a strict rule and a driver will lose his license if you violate that directive.</p>

<h3>Where You Stay Makes a Difference</h3>


<p>If you plan to visit Yala, make sure to choose a hotel close to the park. The closest one, Chaaya Wild Lodge, is pricey, but the accommodations and food are first rate. If you cannot stay there, I suggest you be within 30 minutes of the park. The reason is that the park opens at 6:00 AM and you want to be right at the entrance with your jeep driver by six.  As is you’ll be getting up at 5:00AM; 4:00 AM is even less fun. And do NOT rely on mileage. The roads leading to Yala are barely that. They are pockmarked, rutted and in terrible repair, so a distance of even 5 km may take 20 minutes or more. Most hotels will pack a hearty box breakfast for you, but be sure to check. Most tours will stop at a safe haven on the Indian Ocean for a 15 minute breakfast and bathroom (spelled b-u-s-h-e-s) break.</p>

<p><a href="http://blog.lesterpickerphoto.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/04/DSC_1729.jpg"><img class="size-medium wp-image-2091" title="DSC_1729" src="http://blog.lesterpickerphoto.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/04/DSC_1729-300x201.jpg" alt="" width="300" height="201"></a></p>

<h3>Wildlife Galore</h3>


<p>In Yala you will see an abundance of wildlife, but do not go with the expectations of African safaris. You’ll see no herds of animals here, other than small groups of deer or water buffalo. Also, Yala is a forest park. The roads are exceedingly rutty and narrow, meaning that passing an oncoming jeep is a negotiation that happens dozens of time in your tours. However, if you can get past that, here is a partial list of animals I saw in three days of safari. Since it is primarily a forest park, wildlife will virtually step out of the forest right in front of you, even gigantic bull elephants, but then disappear just as quickly. As in Africa, wildlife tend to congregate at waterholes, so your safari will visit many of these.</p>

<p>Mongoose</p>

<p>Toucan</p>

<p>Wild boar</p>

<p>Peacock</p>

<p>Elephant</p>

<p>Green Bee Eater and Chestnut-Headed Bee Eater</p>

<p>Water buffalo</p>

<p>Pelican</p>

<p>Leopard</p>

<p>Land monitor</p>

<p>Fish eagle</p>

<p>Changeable hawk eagle</p>

<p>Spotted deer</p>

<p>Crocodiles</p>

<p>Brown fish owl</p>

<p>Tortoise</p>

<p>Rabbit</p>

<p>Storks</p>

<p>Cranes</p>

<p>Jungle Fowl (Sri Lanka’s national bird)</p>

<p>Bear (very rare sighting)</p>

<p>Samba deer/elk</p>

<p>Silver langur monkeys</p>

<p>Jackal</p>

<p>I named only a sampling of birds, since I am not a serious birder and there were dozens of birds that true birders were ga-ga over.</p>

<p><a href="http://blog.lesterpickerphoto.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/04/DSC_1775.jpg"><img class="size-medium wp-image-2092" title="DSC_1775" src="http://blog.lesterpickerphoto.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/04/DSC_1775-300x211.jpg" alt="" width="300" height="211"></a></p>

<h3>Don’t Forget the Landscape</h3>


<p>Yala is bounded on one side by the Indian Ocean, adding a strikingly beautiful element for photographers. As well there are rocky promontories and tortuous trees waiting for your creative interpretation.</p>

<p><a href="http://blog.lesterpickerphoto.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/04/A0018976.jpg"><img class="size-medium wp-image-2093" title="A0018976" src="http://blog.lesterpickerphoto.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/04/A0018976-300x225.jpg" alt="" width="300" height="225"></a></p>

<h3>Photo Recommendations</h3>


<p>If you plan on photographing in Yalla, here a some tips:</p>

<p>First and foremost, bring lots of water as it can get hellishly hot and humid. Also bring food.</p>

<p>Tell your driver right away that when he stops for viewing to shut off the engine immediately. That will reduce shaking and result in better photos.</p>

<p>Use a good tripod or bean bag to stabilize your images, another good reason to have a jeep all to yourself or with one other person.</p>

<p>Bring a polarizer for landscape images.</p>

<p>Be patient. You can go for 2-1/2 hours without seeing a leopard and then suddenly a beautiful male or mother with a cub is right there.</p>

<p>There are plenty of elephants in the park and your nearly guaranteed to see some. But, unlike Africa, you’ll see small families, not large family groupings.</p>

<p>Absolutely essential is a dust-proof bag to completely cover your camera(s). Yala is a very dusty environment and with jeeps constantly passing by the dust problem is real. Develop a ritual to uncover your gear when you shoot, then immediately cover it again when you’re done.</p>

<p>Clean your camera after every safari segment. Do not wait. Bring a blower, brush, cleaning fluid and cloth with you and have it ready in your hotel room. On site use a blower and a LensPen brush/lens cleaner.</p>

<p><a href="http://blog.lesterpickerphoto.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/04/A0018981.jpg"><img class="size-medium wp-image-2094" title="A0018981" src="http://blog.lesterpickerphoto.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/04/A0018981-300x225.jpg" alt="" width="300" height="225"></a></p>

<p>I’ll add some more tips as I think of them, so please check back periodically.</p>

		  <div class="entry-content"><p>I am thoroughly enjoying my stay in Sri Lanka, an island off the southern coast of India. It has a very long history of self-governance, subjugation to foreign powers (think Portugal and Britain, to name just two), followed by self-governance once again. Today, some two years after it signed a peace treaty with the Tamil Tiger rebels in the north, the country is a relatively stable democracy (Is any democracy really “stable?”).</p>

<p>Seventy-five percent of its people are Buddhist, with Hindus making up 15% and Muslims and Christians together representing 7.5%. I have been struck by how incredibly seamlessly the religions coexist and respect each other, knowing each others‘ holidays, beliefs and practices.</p>

<p>Both Buddhists and Hindus have, over the centuries, built exquisite temples and monasteries, worthy of extensive photography, if only I had enough time this visit. I do intend to return, though.</p>

<p><a href="http://blog.lesterpickerphoto.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/04/A0018543.jpg"><img class="alignnone size-medium wp-image-2080" title="A0018543" src="http://blog.lesterpickerphoto.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/04/A0018543-300x229.jpg" alt="" width="300" height="229"></a></p>

<p>This is one example, a monastery built into a cliff overhang and known as the Dambulla Cave Temple. In many temple enclaves, you will find both Buddhist and Hindu places of worship, although not in Dambulla. Over the centuries the two religions have intertwined so that they share a few of the same deities.</p>

<p>Photographically, Sri Lanka is a complex place to plan a visit. You&#8217;ll want to have a tripod with you to record its architecture and landscapes, but you&#8217;ll also need a good short zoom (like the Nikon 24-70) for markets and people. Always bring a polarizing filter with you, of course, wherever you travel. And ALWAYS ask permission before you stick a camera in someone&#8217;s face or think you are smart by photographing someone surreptitiously from far away with your long zoom. As always, let common courtesy prevail.</p>

		  <div class="entry-content"><p>One thing you should know if you’re thinking of driving in Sri Lanka… don’t! Hire a local driver (very reasonable), keep your eyes closed, and bring your rosaries or whatever else might endear you to your particular God. (Click on the short mini-videos I took, below.)</p>

<p>First, as a former British colony, Sri Lankan’s drive on the left side of the road, which is disconcerting for those of us that come from right-sided countries. But the basic issue with driving in this interesting country is… well… the drivers.</p>

<p>Road markings carry little meaning here on the mostly narrow and <a href="http://youtu.be/UF8bYW7SbX8">heavily congested roads</a>. Cars cross into opposing lanes constantly. Motorcyclists weave in and out of traffic, ignoring any rules of the road (if there are any here). Tuk-tuks, tiny three wheel vehicles that carry passengers, will drive on pedestrian walkways, narrowly avoiding collisions with people.</p>

<p>Buses will lurch into opposing traffic and then swerve at the last possible millisecond to avoid a head-on collision. The group I was with got to rating these near misses as one might at an Olympic event. The closest to a near-death experience was a 9.9 with an oncoming bus, where both drivers swerved at impossibly sharp angles in a nanosecond.  Neither hesitated and rove on as if nothing had happened. Breakfast definitely did not taste as good the second time around.</p>

<p>There is also a horn etiquette, where drivers announce their intention to pass and then give two short honks either to thank the driver they just passed, or as an offering to Buddha that they lived to scare their passengers yet again… and again. There are even traffic jams on safaris!</p>

<p><a href="http://blog.lesterpickerphoto.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/04/photo.jpg"><img class="size-medium wp-image-2086" title="photo" src="http://blog.lesterpickerphoto.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/04/photo-300x225.jpg" alt="" width="300" height="225"></a></p>

<p>One final driving warning. Sri Lankans share the road very contentedly with cows and <a href="http://youtu.be/j_lj4RsQHgQ">water buffalo</a>. Since Sri Lanka is primarily rural and depends heavily on its own agricultural production to feed its people, and since the majority of Sri Lankans are Buddhist and venerate their animals, peaceful coexistence reigns supreme, even if it takes ten minutes to wait for <a href="http://youtu.be/s5KKgGSvzZ8">a herd of cows</a> to relinquish the road to their human caretakers.</p>

<p>So there you have it. Enjoy Sri Lanka, but don’t drive while there yourself!</p>

		  <div class="entry-content"><p>I&#8217;m sitting here in my nearly empty hotel, after being one of only two people in the restaurant. At 2:49 this afternoon, as I was on safari in Yala National Park in Sri Lanka, the government ordered all tourists evacuated from the area. An 8.8 magnitude earthquake of the Sumatran coast triggered fears of a tsunami. In 2004, Sri Lanka lost 30,000 people, including many tourists, as a result of a similar earthquake near Sumatra. In that tsunami, most of the damage occurred along the southern and south-western coastal areas.</p>

<p><a href="http://blog.lesterpickerphoto.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/04/map_of_sri-lanka.jpg"><img class="alignnone size-medium wp-image-2077" title="map_of_sri-lanka" src="http://blog.lesterpickerphoto.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/04/map_of_sri-lanka-300x225.jpg" alt="" width="300" height="225"></a></p>

<p>I was driven 60 miles inland to higher ground, but there was no panic among the locals, but a lot among the tourists. I waited for hours past the prime time when the tsunami was predicted to hit, then returned to my hotel near the coast along with my driver and translator, Susil, who had dinner with me. If you look at the map, you&#8217;ll find Yala on the southeastern side. I am presently staying between Yala and Tissamaharama. After my safaris, I&#8217;ll spend the Buddhist New Year&#8217;s celebration photographing at a Buddhist temple in Tissa, as locals call the town.</p>

<p>Now we&#8217;re on watch, just in case of a major aftershock, buit that is considered so unlikely we were allowed to return. I have to get up at 4:30AM to be back at the magnificent Yala NP for sunrise.</p>

		  <div class="entry-content"><p>By my second day in Sri Lanka, I began to notice the considerable number of dogs lying around next to roads or scavenging for scraps of foods. In most cases these dogs are not a pretty sight. Most are thin, many are mangy and flea-ridden. While the more fortunate animals have caring owners, by far the majority of the dogs I saw were feral.</p>

<p><a href="http://blog.lesterpickerphoto.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/04/A0018816.jpg"><img class="alignnone size-medium wp-image-2066" title="A0018816" src="http://blog.lesterpickerphoto.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/04/A0018816-225x300.jpg" alt="" width="225" height="300"></a></p>

<p>The feral dog problem is interesting. In past years the government has tried dog control programs, none of them very successful. More successful are its rabies control efforts. The reasons for these failures and successes are complex, but are rooted in the country’s Buddhist majority.</p>

<p><a href="http://blog.lesterpickerphoto.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/04/A0018773.jpg"><img class="size-medium wp-image-2067" title="A0018773" src="http://blog.lesterpickerphoto.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/04/A0018773-230x300.jpg" alt="" width="230" height="300"></a></p>

<p>Invariably, dog euthanization efforts fail because Sri Lankan Buddhists believe the dog may be a reincarnated spirit, and so when the animal control officers come around, they will say that the feral dogs belong to them. On the other hand, rabies control efforts are very successful because it benefits both dogs and people.</p>

<p>In any event, the upshot is that dogs are found everywhere in Sri Lanka, mostly sleeping on their sides in the hot Sri Lankan sun. Or in train stations, on rocks, in bazaars, in alleyways. They care not a whit that people are walking around and stepping over them. On one trip, a small macaque monkey scavenged in front of, around and over a sleeping dog who opened one eye every so often, but otherwise seemed quite content.</p>

<p><a href="http://blog.lesterpickerphoto.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/04/A0018623.jpg"><img class="size-medium wp-image-2068" title="A0018623" src="http://blog.lesterpickerphoto.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/04/A0018623-300x225.jpg" alt="" width="300" height="225"></a></p>

<p>None of the dogs I saw were aggressive in any way. Instead, they sometimes come up to you, tail between their legs, looking for scraps of food. Most will adopt a family and just hang out around their homes, if they are in a rural area. In towns and cities, the dogs will hang around parks or in front of shops. People do not seem to mind at all and never once did I see a person shooing a dog away. Peaceful coexistence ala Buddhism.</p>

The lodge is simply gorgeous and I do mean both simply and gorgeous. To minimize uninvited &#8220;guests&#8221; the individual lodge cabins are simply, but elegantly decorated. Even so, I am sharing my room with five very cute- and very fast- geckos.</p>

<p><a href="http://blog.lesterpickerphoto.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/04/DSC_1315.jpg"><img class="size-medium wp-image-2072" title="DSC_1315" src="http://blog.lesterpickerphoto.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/04/DSC_1315-300x200.jpg" alt="" width="300" height="200"></a></p>

<p>The grounds are gorgeous, with a natural lake on one end and the Indian Ocean on the other. Crocodiles and any number of birds are visible from the reception area.</p>

<p>However, the park&#8217;s leopards, elephants, monkeys, wild boars and snakes regularly roam the premises at night, requiring guests to call for an escort when walking from their cottages to the restaurant, pool or reception areas at night. This sign clinches it of rme.</p>

		  <div class="entry-content"><p>It&#8217;s one of those events that photographers crave, when we run into some rich cultural event entirely by accident. And that&#8217;s the way not came down yesterday, when I happened into a Hindu Festival to the god Murga, know to locals here as Cataragama. Murga is the god for families and for those people starting a new business venture. Its adherents are a passionate bunch, as you will see here.</p>

<p><a href="http://blog.lesterpickerphoto.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/04/DSC_10661.jpg"><img class="alignnone size-medium wp-image-2059" title="DSC_1066" src="http://blog.lesterpickerphoto.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/04/DSC_10661-300x215.jpg" alt="" width="300" height="215"></a></p>

<p>This man was one of several who put a stick through his cheek to show his devotion, or in some cases to prove their worth for blessings from the god. The festivities begin the night before and wind from the temple a few kilometers away to the town center and back. The festivities include fire walking and putting sticks through the skin of the back. The Hindus participating in the procession dance themselves into a frenzied trance. They can dance like this for 24 hours.</p>

<p>The object you will see on the back of the dancer in the video is normally kept in the temple, but is removed once a year for this festival.</p>

<p><a href="http://youtu.be/PJCO1VoMtnU">Here is a 1-minute video</a> of the street scene I came upon.</p>

		  <div class="entry-content"><p>Rope making has a long and storied history in Sri Lanka. Known formerly as the British colony of Ceylon, Sri Lankans have been making rope from coconut husks for centuries. The ropes were used in Her Majesty&#8217;s navy, as well as hundreds of other uses.</p>

<p>I had the opportunity to visit with a family business that still makes coconut ropes the old fashioned way. I thought I&#8217;d share this fascinating peek into a rural business with you. I have two videos to go along with it.</p>

<p>It all starts with the coconut, from which all manner of products are made, including shampoos, cooking oils, liquor, soap&#8230; the list goes on. Once the fruit and meat are removed, what is left is the husk.</p>

<p><a href="http://blog.lesterpickerphoto.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/04/images.jpeg"><img class="size-full wp-image-2055" title="images" src="http://blog.lesterpickerphoto.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/04/images.jpeg" alt="" width="259" height="194"></a></p>

<p>Now the women (yes, it is primarily a women&#8217;s occupation), take these husk sections and put it through a machine that combs the fibers and orients them in the same direction. <a href="http://youtu.be/i16SnuxFpNs">Here is what that process looks like.</a></p>

<p>Once the husk sections are completed, the worker has a huge pile of fibers from which to make the rope. In this next video, you can see how they use simple machines to <a href="http://youtu.be/A33xcEYkjec">spin the fibers into continuous rope</a>. They then combine individual ropes to make double, quadruple and even thicker ropes. It&#8217;s truly a time-intensive process, which is one of the reasons that coconut rope is valued by many to this day.</p>

		  <div class="entry-content"><p>Just a quick travel vignette. While touring Sri Lanka, I visited a temple complex. Often these temples are located in rural or suburban areas and have an endemic monkey population. Since the country is primarily Buddhist, people and our near relatives coexist very peacefully.</p>

<p><a href="http://blog.lesterpickerphoto.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/04/A0018443.jpg"><img class="size-medium wp-image-2050" title="A0018443" src="http://blog.lesterpickerphoto.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/04/A0018443-300x209.jpg" alt="" width="300" height="209"></a></p>

<p>That peace and harmony was broken by a women who went to retrieve her wandering toddler, mistakenly leaving her pocketbook behind. In the blink of an eye, a silver langur swung down and snatched the purse. When the woman ran after it, the offending primate jumped into a tree and sat on a branch. As we watched, he rummaged through her purse, dropping all manner of items to the ground, some of them, shall I say, of a personal nature. The poor woman was embarrassed, but also laughing. When the critter was left with an empty bag, he sniffed it to see if any vestige of food escaped his TSA-like hand check. When he found none, he simply dropped the pocketbook on the ground and scanned the tide of humans for his next victim.</p>

		  <div class="entry-content"><p>I&#8217;ve been asked what a typical Sri Lankan town is like, so I&#8217;m including <a href="http://youtu.be/8TED1BbGqZU">this short video</a> taken as we drove through a modest one in the central region.</p>

<p>A typical village would be much smaller, with perhaps one or two tiny retail stores offering basic essentials. However, every town and village appears to be bursting at the seems with fresh vegetables and fruits, rice and other staples.</p>

<p><a href="http://blog.lesterpickerphoto.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/04/A0018626.jpg"><img class="size-medium wp-image-2062 " title="A0018626" src="http://blog.lesterpickerphoto.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/04/A0018626-300x225.jpg" alt="" width="300" height="225"></a></p>

<p>Note that many women walk with umbrellas in the scorching heat. Also note the multi-colored tuk-tuks in the video. Tuk-tuks are a primary form of transportation in poor towns and villages and in large cities with lots of traffic congestion. These highly maneuverable 3-wheeled vehicles can carry up to 5 or 6 passengers, although the usual is 1 or 2. The fares are generally very modest, but even so most Sri Lankans walk great distances to purchase basic items.</p>

		  <div class="entry-content"><p>I&#8217;m traveling through Sri Lanka (literal translation: Jewel of the Indian Ocean), where Internet access is spotty at best, so this will be the first of several short blogs.</p>

<p>Driving through the countryside in the central area of Sri Lanka, there is much agriculture, especially rice paddies. Often you will see these structures in the fields.</p>

<p><a href="http://blog.lesterpickerphoto.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/04/watchtower.jpg"><img class="size-medium wp-image-2042" title="watchtower" src="http://blog.lesterpickerphoto.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/04/watchtower-300x225.jpg" alt="" width="300" height="225"></a></p>

<p>Any idea what it is you are looking at? <strong>Hint</strong>: There are usually four of them, one in each corner of a field.</p>

<p>ANSWER: This is a watchtower. At night hired workers will mouth these towers, protecting the fields from wild elephants and wild boars, both of which can devastate a crop in a couple of hours. The men will sing all night long, chant Buddhist prayers and otherwise keep themselves awake.  With approximately 6,000 wild elephants, Sri Lankans appear to live in peaceful co-existence with their wild animal brethren.</p>

		  <div class="entry-content"><p>And what a journey it&#8217;s been! From the time I left BWI airport until I checked into my hotel in Sri Lanka, 31 hours had elapsed; 34 hours bed to bed. That is one l-o-n-g trip. The only saving grace was that Emirate Airlines was wonderful, with attentive service even in economy. My longest flight segment, 12-1/2 hours, was only 1/2 full, so I was able to sleep on and off, something I’m rarely able to accomplish in the air unless I get lucky and land a business class upgrade.</p>

<p><a href="http://blog.lesterpickerphoto.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/03/CameraAwesome-bwi.jpg"><img class="size-medium wp-image-2039" title="CameraAwesome-bwi" src="http://blog.lesterpickerphoto.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/03/CameraAwesome-bwi-300x224.jpg" alt="" width="300" height="224"></a></p>

<p>I left Baltimore just four days after returning from Israel with a very bad cough and congestion. In retrospect, I probably should have cancelled the Sri Lanka trip because I was absolutely miserable on the trip. Understandably, two people in nearby seats asked to have their seats changed due to my incessant coughing.</p>

<p>My flight included a layover in Dubai, but the desert sands gave us only a brown-fog view of its immense structures. The airport in Dubai is state-of-the-art modern, with the stores crowded so close together it gives one the feeling of a souk.</p>

<p>I arrived in Columbo, Sri Lanka exhausted. The temperature today was 88F and very humid, with the sun so strong I could hardly stay under it for more than a few minutes at a time. Hopefully, it will do wonders for my cough. In any event, the adventure begins.</p>

		  <div class="entry-content"><p>On my recent Israel trip I have been in Tel Aviv, Jaffa and several locations in the Golan Heights in northern Israel, as well as Jerusalem and its surrounds. I visited so many archaeological sites, I’m suffering from overload (and also from a wicked cough and cold, so please accept my apologies for not blogging in a week!).</p>

<p>Since Israel is such an iconic destination and since so much has already been written about it, I’ll only add my two cents in the form of observations and impressions. I’ll leave political discussions for the experts who, by the way, have not managed to solve one big issue regarding Israel and the Palestinians in 50 years!</p>

<h3>You’ve Been Where?</h3>


<p>It’s true that you can drive from the most northerly point in Israel to its southern border in just six hours. Across its widest point it is no more than a 90 minute drive.</p>

<p>What that means is that you can cover a lot of territory in a fairly short amount of time. If your friends express skepticism that you could visit so many places in week or two, take out a map (or your iPhone) and show them just how tiny Israel really is. In fact, Israel is only the size of New Jersey, except in Israel’s case somehow it got squeezed in the center (not so good for its security).</p>

<p>My point is that Israel is much smaller than I ever imagined, a view shared by many other tourists with whom I chatted.</p>

<h3>Be Prepared to be Amazed</h3>


<p>Israel is at the crossroads of cultures. and civilizations. The Jewish people, who have been here for thousands of years, have seen Greeks and Romans, Babylonians and Turks, Macedonians and British conquer and then lose their hold on this land. As each new master came and went, they left their mark in the form of buildings, ideas, culture and people. You’re constantly sampling from a historical smorgasbord as you visit sites here.</p>

<p><a href="http://blog.lesterpickerphoto.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/03/A0018222.jpg"><img class="size-medium wp-image-2035" title="A0018222" src="http://blog.lesterpickerphoto.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/03/A0018222-223x300.jpg" alt="" width="223" height="300"></a></p>

<h3>Contrast Central</h3>


<p>If there is any nation on earth that has more contrasts than Israel, I dare you to show it to me. Nowhere else that I have been has such massive amounts of antiquity been situated next door to such modernity. Doubt it? Just visit Caesarea where the ancient Roman fortress sits next door to a power plant, or Safed, where modern shops are seamlessly woven through ancient Roman aqueducts and restored architecture. Or Jerusalem, where it’s hard to take a decent picture in the Old City without including a satellite dish, electrical wires or a sign.</p>

<p>There is more. Where else can the Ultra-religious survive comfortably within such a modern and secular society? Where else in the Middle East can you find Arabs living peacefully with Jews and Christians in a democracy (and with equal citizenship rights)? Yet squalor sometimes sits next to modern, high rise hotels. Go figure.</p>

<p>Finally, Israel is mostly desert, yet its per capita agricultural production and efficiency are among the highest of any nation on earth. They have perfected the drip irrigation system and export that technology worldwide. Everywhere I traveled, whether city or rural, drip lines extend through commercial plantings, private gardens and huge fields.</p>

<h3>Graffiti</h3>


<p>I simply was not prepared for the profusion of graffiti scrawled on clean walls and streets throughout Tel Aviv and Jerusalem. Not artistic graffiti, which I detest anyway because of the way it affronts one’s sensibilities and ruins the architecture. No, the graffiti I saw in Israel was nothing short of vandalism, plain and simple.</p>

<h3>Leave Your Biblical Impressions At Home</h3>


<p>I’m amazed at how my biblical references were turned upside down during my visit. The mighty Sea of Galilee that we read about in the Bible is nothing more than a fairly small lake. In fact, the Romans called it Lake Tiberias. Ancient synagogues of note would easily fit into the living rooms of many respectably-sized American houses. Judging from the living areas and low archways, the heroes of the Bible were rather short. And, most disappointing of all was the mighty and wide Jordan River. In reality it is a narrow, muddy creek.</p>

<h3>A Vibrant Economy</h3>


<p>During my visit you’d hardly know that the world is in recession. Building is going on everywhere, with huge cranes dominating the city skylines. High tech is huge in Israel, with many of the patents for the gadgets we love originating in this tiny country. As a result, Microsoft, Intel, Apple and other high-tech giants maintain research campuses in Israel. Their highly educated workforce propels their economy.</p>

<p><a href="http://blog.lesterpickerphoto.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/03/A0018139-Edit.jpg"><img class="size-medium wp-image-2034" title="A0018139-Edit" src="http://blog.lesterpickerphoto.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/03/A0018139-Edit-300x225.jpg" alt="" width="300" height="225"></a></p>

<h3>Diversity Rules</h3>


<p>Israel appears to my eyes to be as diverse a democracy as I could imagine. First, of course, is the diversity within the Jewish community. The Ultra-Orthodox live side by side with secular Jews who embrace their culture but do not put a lot of emphasis on their faith. On  the Jewish Sabbath I saw every sect racing past each other on the way to their respective houses of worship.</p>

<p>Then, on Sunday, Old Jerusalem was packed with Christian worshippers of every persuasion rushing to services. Greek Orthodox, Roman Catholic, Armenian Orthodox, and every Protestant denomination you can think of, all with free and unfettered access to their holy places.</p>

<p>Every day, five times a day, the city’s minarets blare out their call to prayer over ramped-up loudspeakers. Here, Israeli Arabs enjoy freedoms unimagined in the rest of the Arab world. Of course there are still issues of equity, as there are in every democracy on earth, but in Israel there are forums in which to address them.</p>

<h3>A Half-Dozen Tips for visiting Israel</h3>


<p>1.Hire a good guide. Get recommendations. Search the web. Do your due diligence. Whether on a tour or one-on-one, a good guide will make a world of difference. Plus, there is so much history, only a good guide will be able to tie it all together.</p>

<p>2. Try the falafel. Even if you have tried falafel and hated it in the U.S., try it again here. Falafel reigns supreme in Israel and it is very, very good; fresh ingredients, deeply fried, and nestled in a pita covered with sauce and salad.</p>

<p>3. Avoid driving. The traffic jams and narrow streets in Jerusalem are a challenge, as they are in Tel Aviv. If possible, use Jerusalem’s light rail or extensive bus system. Trains run between major cities. Road signage is in Hebrew, with only a percentage including English translations.</p>

<ol>
<li><p>Know the exchange rate. When I was there the rate is was roughly 4 shekels to 1 USD (actually 3.75:1). Since most merchants will accept either currency, be wary of glib exchange quotes. I wanted to hire a taxi and my Arabic driver quoted me 60 shekels. I had been quoted 40 earlier in the day and I told him so. “Okay, for you my American friend” he said, “I’ll make it half, just 30 US dollars.” Huh??</p></li>
<li><p>Bring adapters with you. I recommend 2-3 if you’re packing lots of electronic gear. As a photographer I carry battery chargers, iPhone, laptop, and more.</p></li>
<li><p>Be open-minded. The mid-East, and Israel in particular, is in the news constantly. I saw with my own eyes that much of what we hear is distorted. Ask questions. Talk to ordinary citizens. Israel is a nation surrounded by enemies, which has served to frame its collective psyche. Try to understand their point of view. Substitute your own country for Israel, put it in Israel’s circumstances, and try to imagine what your country might do.</p></li>
</ol>

		  <div class="entry-content"><p>It’s one of those experiences few travelers get to have nowadays. I was aboard an El Al flight to Israel, when suddenly a group of bearded men, all Ultra-Orthodox Jews, stood and walked to the rear of the plane. Strange, I thought, and immediately thought of the rapture. Ooops, that could never happen on El Al!.</p>

<p>We had been on the flight for nearly eight hours, and the sun was just peeking over the horizon, reluctantly lighting up the plane for we sleepy travelers. The men were congregating to perform their morning prayers. Jewish ritual requires at least ten men to be present for the service to carry even more significance in their communion with God.</p>

<p>Here is an iPhone image I took of one of the men, who apparently had overslept and was praying alone. It was extraordinary to see how easily the flight attendants accommodated the gathering, staying out of their way for the 15 minutes they required. They then quietly returned to their seats as if nothing unusual had happened.</p>

<p><a href="http://blog.lesterpickerphoto.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/03/photo1.jpg"><img class="alignnone size-medium wp-image-2023" title="photo" src="http://blog.lesterpickerphoto.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/03/photo1-e1332009191540-225x300.jpg" alt="" width="225" height="300"></a></p>

<p>Earlier in the flight, some of those same Ultra-Orthodox men walked around the plane asking male passengers if they were Jewish and, if they were, would they like to join them in putting on the Tfillin. Tfillin are a pair of ritualistic leather straps, known in English as phylacteries, that have a box attached to each set. The boxes contain hand inscribed prayers. One set is placed on the head and one on the left arm, next to the heart. These phylacteries are described in the Old Testament and are a way that pious Jews “bind” themselves to God, by wrapping the leather straps around their arm and placing the second box on their forehead, held in place by the straps. With the heart and brain now connected, the person is supposed to feel a personal connection with their Supreme Being.</p>

<p>Be that as it may, the non-Jewish passengers were alternately amused or curious regarding the ritual and lively discussions broke out throughout the plane, or at least in the cattle section, which is where I was stanchioned. Groups of men and women watched as the Rabbis helped the Jewish volunteers with the ritual. Imagine that happening on a Southwest Airlines flight between Dallas and Little Rock!</p>

<p>Only one thing could possibly have interrupted such an essential spiritual act. DINNER! Jews, like Italians, ascribe to eating certain spiritual dimensions that trump virtually any God-given commandment including, apparently, Thou Shalt Not Kill. I know this because many were the times I heard my Aunts and Uncles say to me: “Oy, I’d kill for a piece of your mother’s gefilte fish!” Which is also probably why I never ate gefilte fish in front of my relatives.</p>

<p>Anyway, with the announcement that dinner was about to be served, Tfillin were hurriedly packed into their embroidered pouches and the Rabbis led the charge back to our respective six inches of real estate.</p>

<p>Which brings me to my final point in all this, that being that if cattle were actually packed into spaces that were proportionally as tight as El-Al’s economy seats, how long do you think it would be before the ASPCA, ACLU, PETA, ADA, and every other dyed-in-the-wool (make that non-toxic dye, of course… kosher, too) animal loving organization sued for inhumane treatment?</p>

		  <div class="entry-content"><p>I could really use some help here. Bob (my assistant) and I recently decided to buy a new printer to support our ever growing fine art print business. We need to be able to produce very large prints, so we&#8217;re opting for a printer that can produce 44&#8221; prints.</p>

<p>We&#8217;ve narrowed the field to the Canon ipf 8300 and the Epson 9900, both seemingly very capable machines.</p>

<p><a href="http://blog.lesterpickerphoto.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/03/images1.jpeg"><img class="size-full wp-image-2016" title="images" src="http://blog.lesterpickerphoto.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/03/images1.jpeg" alt="" width="282" height="178"></a></p>

<p>However, this is a scary move for me. First, these machines are monsters, weighing around 400 lbs and occupying lots of real estate. They are costly to buy and I don&#8217;t even want to think about paper and ink costs!</p>

<p>I&#8217;d love to know if any of you have either of these printers and, if so, what you think of them. Please give me nuts and bolts. What do you love and hate about them? How expensive are they to upkeep? Did you buy the extended warranty? What do you think of the print quality? Any tips, tricks or suggestions? Any comments would be greatly appreciated.</p>

<p><a href="http://blog.lesterpickerphoto.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/03/images-1.jpeg"><img class="size-full wp-image-2017" title="images-1" src="http://blog.lesterpickerphoto.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/03/images-1.jpeg" alt="" width="234" height="216"></a></p>

<p>Thanks. I look forward to hearing from you. I&#8217;ll certainly keep you posted as I go through this process.</p>

<p>In a few days I&#8217;m bound for Israel, spending ten days on a tour, which is kind of a first for me. Frankly, I&#8217;m not the tour group type. Not that there is anything wrong with tours. It&#8217;s just that people tend to take a distinct dislike to me when I&#8217;m just setting up my tripod and camera for a shot while they&#8217;re already piling back on the bus to move to the next spot. The frustration on both sides after only a couple of days is almost electric.</p>

<p>That&#8217;s the big problem with tours for me. Being a photographer I like to spend as much time as I like in interesting places and no time in places I consider photographically less than interesting (to me). However, I promised my wife that I would be good, and I plan to stick by that.</p>

<p>Except&#8230;  I do plan to bring some camera gear with me (&#8220;Define &#8216;some,&#8217; honey!), mostly for market images, shots of people, as well as iconic architectural images. Since I have to be efficient and grab shots on the run, so to speak, I was wondering if you folks could help me out?</p>

<p>What images would you suggest? Any &#8220;secret&#8221; vantage points at monuments or other locales? What would you say are the &#8220;not to be missed&#8221; images?</p>

<p>Thanks in advance. I&#8217;m looking forward to your responses.</p>

<p>Les</p>

<p><strong>UPDATE</strong>:  I decided to take two camera systems with me. Don&#8217;t ask. I know I&#8217;m nuts, but what if I&#8217;m at some iconic location and the sun is setting over a perfect pastoral scene and&#8230; yadda yadda. I&#8217;m hoping to get at least a few good keepers, so I figure it&#8217;s worth shlepping my Hassy and Nikon systems, just in case. Just wish me luck getting through El Al airline security!</p>

		  <div class="entry-content"><h3>My Newest E-Book Is Here!</h3>


<p>I’m really excited to announce that the newest eBook in <strong><em>The Photographer’s Eye</em></strong> series is now available. Titled <strong><em>Wildlife</em></strong>, the eBook takes you behind the scenes as I explain the how, why and technical challenges I faced for ten selected images I have taken of wildlife over the years.</p>

<p>Following on the heels of my first two eBooks, <strong><em>Landscapes 1 </em></strong>&amp;<strong><em> People</em></strong>, the newest addition describes in detail the process I went through to take images of wildlife that my editors and clients have loved. You’ll learn the dos and don’ts of great wildlife photography by following what I did right- and what went wrong- as I captured these images.</p>

<p><a href="http://blog.lesterpickerphoto.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/02/LAP0582.jpg"><img class="alignnone size-medium wp-image-1997" title="_LAP0582" src="http://blog.lesterpickerphoto.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/02/LAP0582-300x200.jpg" alt="" width="300" height="200"></a></p>

<p>In <strong><em>Wildlife</em></strong> I’ve also intentionally broadened the definition of wildlife to include small, as well as large animals, and urban critters as well as those found in remote locales.</p>

<p>Each two-page spread includes an ultra high-quality 300dpi image and a page of background and explanation. Included with each image are the precise camera settings I used. Unlike other eBooks, all my eBook images are color managed for the absolutely highest quality possible.</p>

<p><a href="http://blog.lesterpickerphoto.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/02/2006-11-ecuador1566.jpg"><img class="alignnone size-medium wp-image-1998" title="Amazon tree boa" src="http://blog.lesterpickerphoto.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/02/2006-11-ecuador1566-300x200.jpg" alt="" width="300" height="200"></a></p>

<p>As in all issues of my <strong><em>The Photographer’s Eye</em></strong> eBooks, <strong><em>Wildlife</em></strong> concludes with a section of detailed tips and suggestions. Titled “Photographing Wildlife: Ten Tips for Images With Impact,” you will get point-by-point recommendations for animal photographs that will add drama and punch to your images, recommendations that are gleaned from my forty years behind the camera.</p>

<p>Priced at just $4.99, each eBook can be kept on your iPod Touch, iPhone, iPad, laptop or other electronic device, so it’s always handy.</p>

<p><a href="http://blog.lesterpickerphoto.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/02/LAP6601-20x30.jpg"><img class="alignnone size-medium wp-image-1999" title="Sally Lightfoot crab, Galapagos" src="http://blog.lesterpickerphoto.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/02/LAP6601-20x30-300x200.jpg" alt="" width="300" height="200"></a></p>

<p>Try one by clicking <a href="http://shop.lesterpickerphoto.com/page/103">here</a> and you’ll be taken to a descriptive page where you’ll be able to place your order. Once again, I warn you. These eBooks are addictive!</p>

		  <div class="entry-content"><p>(Part of a series on Finland)</p>

<p>One of the activities I looked forward to the most while in Finland was a two-day dog-sledding adventure, taking off from the Harriniva Holiday Centre, about 45 minutes out of Kittela. In turn, Kittela is a 90-minute plane ride from Helsinki, so it’s a fair bit of effort to get to this region, located well inside the Arctic Circle.</p>

<h3>Harraniva</h3>


<p>Harraniva is a multi-purpose, multi-season resort run by the grandchildren of the family that founded it in 1973. As such, it boasts a true home-style atmosphere. At any point you might be approached by one of the brothers or sisters that currently run this jewel of a resort and asked about how your stay is going.</p>

<p>If you love cold weather activities, Harraniva is one of the top places to go in Finland, offering cross-country skiing, snowmobiling, snowshoeing, dog-sledding, reindeer sledding and more. While I was there, it was filled with families, mostly Finns and Swedes. Harraniva is located on the Muonio River that borders Sweden and is one of several vacation properties the family owns.</p>

<p><strong>The Adventure Begins</strong></p>

<p>Just as soon as I arrived, I was escorted to the equipment building, where a group of other mushers was already being outfitted. Since I frequent extreme cold weather places, I already had all the gear I needed with me. Had I known what Harraniva offered, I would gladly have left my extra bag at home. As is, I decided to try their outer gear, which proved to be excellent.</p>

<p>As part of their tours, Harraniva supplies woolen socks, insulated boots, insulated overalls and parka, gloves, mittens, scarves, hats and balaclavas (sort of like a high-tech sock that fits over your head, protecting everything but your eyes). Outfitting the group of us took a while, but the staff insisted on everything fitting properly. If there is one thing I’ve learned in my cold weather jaunts, it’s to have the right equipment, properly fitted.</p>

<p>Outfitted, we then walked a few hundred yards to the kennels where 430 sled dogs are born, bred and maintained for the sledding tours. The dogs are divided into eight packs, each one supervised by a master musher and his assistants.</p>

<p>Basically, there are two types of sled dogs. One is, of course, the purebred Siberian husky. The other is the Alaskan husky, which is the term applied to any sled dog of mixed husky breed. If you’ve never heard the eagerness of sled dogs ready to run, you’re in for a surprise. These dogs are happiest when they are on the trail, doing what it is they were bred for. <a href="http://youtu.be/DgxPo4uYJUk">Here, for example, is a short video of them waiting to pull the sled during one of our stops.</a></p>

<p>After some preliminary instructions, we were off, divided into two groups, each with its own professional guide. My group was guided by Raikka (pronounced “Reekee” with a rolling R). The other was guided by Markko. Each turned out to be a unique and colorful character.</p>

<h3>On the Trail</h3>


<p>No sooner had we left Harraniva lodge, then we ran into a snowstorm. Fortunately, the terrain was flat for the first few kilometers, allowing the novice mushers a chance to get a feel for maneuvering their sleds. These dogs didn’t change their pace by voice command. They simply run, either quickly while going downhill, or slowly while pulling their sleds uphill. The trick is learning to maneuver the sled. That involves leaning one way or the other into turns, deftly applying the brakes as needed and jumping off the sled and walking behind it while going up steep grades.</p>

<p>With the snow coming down heavily and the temperatures dropping, we entered the snowy woods. There is nothing that can quite compare with the flat, <a href="http://youtu.be/i3hWGuPZB0s">crystal fairyland forests of Lapland</a> (watch this short video I took on the back of my sled)). They are strikingly gorgeous, the trees covered as they are with thick layers of snow and ice. When the dogs are running, the only sounds you hear are their panting and the swoosh of the sled over the snow.</p>

<p>Our goal that first day was to run an easy 25 km (15 miles), although the going was made more difficult by the sometimes blinding snow. The added wind from traveling lowered the chill factor and nearly everyone was battened down, with only eyes exposed. It’s virtually impossible to wear goggles under these conditions because they fog up and are covered in melting snowflakes.</p>

<p>In the far north (we were about 200 km above the Arctic Circle), the sun- when it is out- hangs low in the sky the entire day, providing a soft, warm glow to the snow. Sunglasses are rarely needed.</p>

<p>In about two hours, Raikka stopped our group next to a wooden teepee. There were outhouses available and while we staked our teams to prevent them from running off, Raikka and Markko started a roaring log fire in the middle of the large teepee and prepared us a hot meal of pan-fried salmon served on potato bread, hot tea or coffee and cookies. Refreshed, we were back on the trail an hour later.</p>

<p>So the rest of the day went, with Raikka using hand signals indicating when we needed to slow down, stop or just plain be cautious due to trail conditions. In another few hours, as dusk fell, we arrived at our cabin for the night.</p>

<h3>The Cabin Experience</h3>


<p>In dogsledding, the adventure includes dog care, so as soon as we reached camp we unhitched the dogs, tied them to stakes for the night, fed and watered them, while Raikka and Markko made sure they were in good health. Only when that was done did we move our gear into the cabins.</p>

<p>Some of the cabins along the five-day safaris have no electricity. Ours did, allowing the guides to cook us a scrumptious dinner, with a large wood stove keeping us very warm. Cabin time is a chance to get to know everyone, and our geographic diversity was amazing, including Italy, Germany, Holland, Finland, Spain, Russia and the U.S.A. Fortunately for me, everyone spoke at least some English. Since Finnish is only spoken in Finland, Finns learn at least two other languages in school. Most everyone chooses English as one of those languages, so travel in Finland is easy for English speakers.</p>

<p>Immediately after dinner, we went separately as groups of men and women to the sauna that was a few yards from the cabin. When the men were done, we came out just as the Northern lights were making a feeble attempt to appear. Within minutes the skies clouded over. Another photographer and I stayed up until 3:00AM hoping in vain for their return.</p>

<p>The women bedded down in one room, while the men went upstairs to the loft to sleep. In about five minutes, everyone was asleep in the sleeping bags we were issued. It probably took me all of a minute to doze off once I crawled into my sleeping bag at 3:00.</p>

<p><strong>The Final Clicks</strong></p>

<p>After a hearty breakfast, and dog care, we were off again.</p>

<p><a href="http://blog.lesterpickerphoto.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/02/A0017831.jpg"><img class="size-medium wp-image-1992" title="A0017831" src="http://blog.lesterpickerphoto.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/02/A0017831-300x225.jpg" alt="" width="300" height="225"></a></p>

<p>The route back covered 35 km (22 miles). Given that the group had gained experience, we made better time coming back. But, confidence sometimes breeds carelessness. On a steep downhill run, a slightly built, 61-year old woman in our group lost control of her sled and it crashed into a tree. She had the wind knocked out of her, but after 30 minutes she was back on her sled, a real trooper in our collective opinion.</p>

<p>Our sledding ended back at Harriniva just as the sun was setting. What we did not know then is that <a href="http://blog.lesterpickerphoto.com/2012/02/19/northern-lights/">a real aurora light show would greet us</a> once we washed up and did the obligatory sauna.</p>

		  <div class="entry-content"><p>Visit Finland in winter and you&#8217;ll get an idea of why Finns are rated amongst the healthiest people on the planet. No, it has nothing to do with their admittedly excellent health care system, in my opinion. Here are my top reasons, in order of&#8230; nothing.</p>

<p><strong>Clothing</strong>. If you wore 17 layers of clothes every day just to go from your house to Helsinki&#8217;s wonderful bus or trolley system, you&#8217;d burn calories faster than a mouse on a treadmill. In Lapland, it&#8217;s 26 layers and waddling is a proven calorie-burner.</p>

<p><strong>Walking</strong>. Finns walk everywhere. If they don&#8217;t walk they ski. Or snowshoe. Or, in Lapland, maybe hitch up a dog team and run it 50 kilometers to the grocery store. Apparently, those activities are good for the heart.</p>

<p><strong>Walking on Helsinki sidewalks</strong>. If New Yorkers had to put up with walking on snow-covered sidewalks like Helsinkians do, there would be a major revolution from my friends in Brooklyn. Fuggedaboudit. I spent three days in Helsinki and during that time it snowed twice. Amazingly, very, very few storekeepers bothered to shovel, even in major shopping districts. Since it is so cold, the snow does not turn to wet slush. Instead it pulverizes into a grungy, sand-like quality. Ever try walking on a sandy beach? This alone makes Finns strong like bulls. This is just a small example of what I mean, two days after a snowfall.</p>

<p><a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WGxU5_mGnLs&amp;feature=youtube_gdata_player">http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WGxU5_mGnLs&amp;feature=youtube_gdata_player</a></p>

<p><strong>Sauna</strong>. Finns will sauna at the drop of a hat&#8230; or clothes. Trust me on this one.</p>

<p><strong>Fish</strong>. Finns eat fish. Lots of fish. I had steamed salmon, grilled salmon, smoked salmon, broiled salmon, salmon salad, even poached salmon. Having gills must take a load off one&#8217;s lungs.</p>

<p><a href="http://blog.lesterpickerphoto.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/02/photo.jpg"><img class="size-medium wp-image-1982" title="photo" src="http://blog.lesterpickerphoto.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/02/photo-300x225.jpg" alt="" width="300" height="225"></a></p>

<p><strong>Reindeer</strong>. Finns also eat a lot of reindeer, so there must be something healthy about it, too. I wonder if they abstain around Christmas time?</p>

<p><strong>Cold Air</strong>. When it&#8217;s -35C outside in winter, it tends to weed out the weaker members of the species. Those left standing are called Finns.</p>

<p>So, that&#8217;s my health report from Finland. And, please pass the tartar sauce.</p>

		  <div class="entry-content"><p>During my stay here in Finland, the weather has been, shall I say, uncooperative&#8230; photographically, that is. The skiers are in heaven, since a lot of snow has fallen. However, for me the weather has been mostly overcast and snowy, limiting my photographic possibilities.</p>

<p>I&#8217;ve only had two days of decent or partially decent weather, but oh, were they grand! One evening the skies put on a show-of-shows. Right before dinner, starting at around 5:30 PM, a colleague and I rushed outside as the Aurora Borealis began to form. Here is a an image I took at dusk.</p>

<p><a href="http://blog.lesterpickerphoto.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/02/LAP4486.jpg"><img class="alignnone size-medium wp-image-1972" title="_LAP4486" src="http://blog.lesterpickerphoto.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/02/LAP4486-300x199.jpg" alt="" width="300" height="199"></a></p>

<p>Now I don&#8217;t know how many of you have experienced The Lights, but all I can say is that there is no other such experience on earth. It is awesome and humbling at the same time. The first time I witnessed them, in Dawson City, Yukon Territory, I wept. They are that incredible.</p>

<p>But every time I have been privileged to see them since, I feel the same degree of awe. They are science&#8217;s portal to the spiritual. I can see how indigenous cultures deified this phenomenon.</p>

<p>Anyway, back to Kittila, Finland, where these images were taken. As I stood on the banks of the Muonio River that separates Finland from Sweden, the skies quickly darkened and the lights came out in full glory. Here is another image, taken from the identical spot on the property of the Harriniva Hotel, just 30 minutes later.</p>

<p><a href="http://blog.lesterpickerphoto.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/02/LAP4502.jpg"><img class="alignnone size-medium wp-image-1974" title="_LAP4502" src="http://blog.lesterpickerphoto.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/02/LAP4502-199x300.jpg" alt="" width="199" height="300"></a></p>

<p>I promised more information on my images this year and in this case the best way I know how to provide that is to refer you to a <a href="http://blog.lesterpickerphoto.com/2011/02/15/how-to-photograph-the-northern-lights/">previous blog I wrote</a> on taking Aurora images.</p>

<p>In eight days I only had one night of good aurora photography, and then it only lasted about 90 minutes, before it became overcast again. Still, how can anyone complain? I&#8217;d easily wait a week again for an hour&#8217;s worth of pure magic.</p>

		  <div class="entry-content"><p>I figure this is something you do once, just to get it out of your system. If you think about coming back again, I’ll recommend my step-son, who is a terrific psychoanalyst.</p>

<p>Here’s the concept. You get to sleep in an unheated building carved from pure ice and resurrected every year anew, so that in no way is the hotel the same every year. You sleep on a bed made of ice. Simple, eh? Think sleeping in your freezer. And I’ll bet you thought travel journalism is all fun and games.</p>

<h3>The Snow Village</h3>


<p>Last night I slept in The Snow Village Hotel located in Lainio, Finland (<a href="http://www.snowvillage.fi">www.snowvillage.fi</a>). It’s nuttier than all get-out, but it’s something I’ve wanted to do for at least 20 years, ever since I first heard of it. You all know that I’m partial to cold weather environments. Since I was going to Finland anyway to do some photography, I figured I’d finally get my chance. And so I booked into the hotel, sometimes known as the ice palace.</p>

<p>The scoop is that every November, here in Finalnd’s north which is known as Lapland, a group of local workers cut blocks of crystal clear ice from the local river situated about 150 meters from the Snow Village. With these blocks, each of which weighs anywhere from 200 to 500 pounds, they lay a foundation and begin to build using some ingenious techniques.</p>

<p>For example, they build a large, domed “chapel” with a ceiling that is at least 25 feet high. They do this by blowing up a huge balloon, then spraying a chemical-free, secret mixture of snow and water over the balloon. It’s so cold in Lapland in November, the structure freezes solid in three hours. They deflate the balloon and continue adding ice until the walls are 18-32 inches thick.</p>

<p><a href="http://blog.lesterpickerphoto.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/02/LAP45252.jpg"><img class="size-medium wp-image-1963" title="_LAP4525" src="http://blog.lesterpickerphoto.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/02/LAP45252-199x300.jpg" alt="" width="199" height="300"></a></p>

<p>Using prefabbed molds they then build the arched walkways of the hotel, from which radiate the 25 individual guest rooms. When the walls are thickened and hardened, they bring in the folks who work long days and nights to carve the various ice statues and wall carvings that are unique to each room.</p>

<p>Amazingly, they do all this within four weeks. This past year it was slightly above zero well into November. Delayed to the last minute, the owners brought in carvers from China to finish the hotel in record time- 2-1/2 weeks!</p>

<p><a href="http://blog.lesterpickerphoto.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/02/LAP45201.jpg"><img class="size-medium wp-image-1964" title="_LAP4520" src="http://blog.lesterpickerphoto.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/02/LAP45201-300x199.jpg" alt="" width="300" height="199"></a></p>

<h3>Settling In</h3>


<p>Guests are given an orientation to the Village, which is an active tourist’s paradise. The Hotel runs snowmobile tours, dogsledding tours, reindeer tours, snowshoeing and cross-country skiing tours. It does have heated cabins on the property, but I wouldn’t be writing this if that’s all they had.</p>

<p>The hotel offers an ice bar and restaurant. Seriously folks, you can order drinks or an entire meal, served to you by waitresses wearing down jackets, woolen caps and mittens. At least I think they were waitresses. Could’ve been waiters, now that I think of it.</p>

<p><a href="http://blog.lesterpickerphoto.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/02/B00178871.jpg"><img class="size-medium wp-image-1965" title="B0017887" src="http://blog.lesterpickerphoto.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/02/B00178871-300x225.jpg" alt="" width="300" height="225"></a></p>

<p>There is also a normal, heated restaurant on the property.  But, you’re probably wondering what it’s like sleeping in a room naturally at -5 Celsius (that’s about 23F), on a bed made of a solid block of ice. Well, it’s…</p>

<h3>The Big Prep</h3>


<p>First a bit of prep. You are given a well made mummy sleeping bag guaranteed to -30F. You also have a freshly washed liner and a pillow. Then follows the advice. Wear your long johns, maybe two pairs if you get cold easily while you sleep. Wear a stocking cap, even though the sleeping bag has a tight drawstring for the head area and all that is exposed are your eyes.</p>

<p>Oh, and bring your gloves, just in case. Wow, this is getting better and better by the minute.</p>

<p>Oh, obviously you can’t have a heated bathroom or dressing area in an ice hotel. Can you? No, you cannot, so the heated changing area is down the arched corridor and then you open two heavy wooden doors and then you run outside about 100 yards to the dressing, bathroom and shower building. Hmmm, interesting.</p>

<p>Oh, and it might not be a good idea to drink before going to bed - actually anytime near bedtime, because, well, you know. It was forecast to be minus 30C (-22F) that night. I decided not to drink after noon.</p>

<p>Oh, and your shoes. I forgot about those. Obviously you’ll leave them next to your “bed,” so on the odd chance that you do get up during the night to pee, you’ll find them a tad bit cold.</p>

<p><a href="http://blog.lesterpickerphoto.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/02/B00178861.jpg"><img class="size-medium wp-image-1969" title="B0017886" src="http://blog.lesterpickerphoto.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/02/B00178861-300x225.jpg" alt="" width="300" height="225"></a></p>

<h3>The Verdict</h3>


<p>So, how was it, you ask? Before the penultimate answer, I’ll quickly describe the process of going to sleep&#8230; in an ice hotel, that is.</p>

<p>I went to the warm dressing building fully clothed, with my polar down jacket on, hat and gloves, as it was -24C (-11F) and falling rapidly. I washed up and changed into two pairs of long johns, socks and my wool cap. I donned a pair of slippers, grabbed my sleeping bag and dashed across the 100 longest meters/yards of my life to the ice hotel guest rooms, where it was a balmy -5C (+23F). In a scene from an old-time movie, in double time I spread my sleeping bag, crawled into the liner, zipped up and pulled the head covering cord tightly, so that only my eyes and nose showed. I closed my eyes and realized… I was too hot! I mean way too hot.</p>

<p>I waited about 30 minutes and shed my extra long johns, closed my eyes, and&#8230; woke up in the morning feeling terrific! I remember a few times during the night breathing the delightfully crisp, cold air. The insulated mattress under me was comfortable, too.</p>

<h3>A Hearty Breakfast</h3>


<p>Finlanders know a thing or two about breakfasts. Healthy, hearty breakfasts. They know how cold demands calories. Breakfasts are a lavish affair. Breakfast smorgasbords are the rule, filled with yogurt, berries, citrus, oatmeal and other porridges, dark breads (as well as light), and the usual assortment of eggs and breakfast meats.</p>

<p>The Snow Hotel is fortunate to have Ella Kurtakko in the kitchen. Each summer she gathers 150 quarts of blueberries and another blue berry native to Scandinavia and makes the most incredible dark blue juice you can imagine. That’s served hot and the feel of it in your mouth is indescribable.</p>

<p>The Snow Hotel is not luxurious by any means, but it is up to European expectations. For example, it has but one tiny bathroom serving the entire reception, restaurant and bar area. The entranceway to the hotel is so unadorned, it looks like a Soviet-era clinic. There is no Internet service but, really, why would you want it in such exquisite surroundings?</p>

<p><a href="http://blog.lesterpickerphoto.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/02/B00178661.jpg"><img class="size-medium wp-image-1966" title="B0017866" src="http://blog.lesterpickerphoto.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/02/B00178661-225x300.jpg" alt="" width="225" height="300"></a></p>

<p>So, if you’re in Finland, you might want to try The Snow Village. Once.</p>

<p>As for me, I do plan to return with some friends. As soon as I post this story, I’ll call my therapist stepson to see if he’ll give me a family discount.</p>

		  <div class="entry-content"><p>Just today I received a wonderful email from a man I just happened to run into a few months back in Valley of Fire State Park in Nevada. I was busily photographing the glorious rock formations in this jewel of a park, when a man approached me and told me I looked remarkably like Ansel Adams, hunched over my camera as I was.</p>

<p>How to take that comment? I was flattered beyond words, hoping that he did not mean that I looked half-dead. But this man, Bob Stowe, was in town for a conference and he seemed like a nice guy. We chatted a while about photography. Bob was sporting a nice camera and looked like he was having a grand time during his afternoon off.</p>

<p>After he left, I went back to my photography, unaware that Bob took a photo of me taking photos. Well, Bob wrote to me today and here&#8217;s what he said:</p>

<p><em>&#8220;I met you at the Nevada Valley of Fire state park in mid November.  I saw you patiently waiting to take a picture through a circular hole in the sandstone.  I thought at a distance you looked remarkably like Ansel Adams resurrected, to which you replied that you well might be! I have a picture of you that I would like to share with you.&#8221;</em></p>

<p>Bob, I&#8217;d like to publicly thank you. What a nice thing to do!</p>

<p>Now, even nice gestures sometimes create conundrums. and this one created a B-I-G one for me. Bob sent three versions of the image and told me to choose whichever one I wanted. Fair enough. One was the original color shot. The second image Bob rendered in B&amp;W. And the third&#8230; well here is where it gets sticky.</p>

<p>The third image Bob processed in sepia tone, conveying the old-timey feel of Ansel Adam&#8217;s time. This, Bob confided in me, was his wife&#8217;s favorite rendition. Ah, and now I&#8217;m supposed to pick one, eh Bob? So, in the interests of marital harmony and the higher purposes of life, I decided on&#8230; the sepia one, naturally (click on the image to enlarge).</p>

<p><a href="http://blog.lesterpickerphoto.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/02/LesterAnselAdamsSepia-2.jpg"><img class="size-medium wp-image-1950" title="LesterAnselAdamsSepia-2" src="http://blog.lesterpickerphoto.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/02/LesterAnselAdamsSepia-2-300x200.jpg" alt="" width="300" height="200"></a></p>

<p>Teasing aside, thanks to Bob (and Ruth) for the gift. Have a great week!</p>

		  <div class="entry-content"><p>This weekend I leave for a week-long assignment in Finland. I’ll mostly be in Lapland, but I’ll also have a couple of days in Helsinki, too. Despite winter temps around -15F in Lapland, I’m really looking forward to this trip. Crazy as it is, I love the frigid far north in winter. Its ethereal beauty is hard to explain and if you’re not into extreme cold it’s even harder to understand.</p>

<p>One of the things I have planned is a two-day dogsled safari. For those of you who have followed my Yukon adventures, you know I love dogsledding, and I’m particularly eager to experience it in Lapland.</p>

<p>I’m also going to do something corny that I’ve wanted to try for at least 20 years now. I booked myself into the weird and whacky Snow Hotel. Believe it or not, the Finns build this snow village every winter and actually carve out rooms and suites, a restaurant, an Ice Bar, slides and tons of ice sculptures. I’ll actually get to sleep on an ice bed, which is covered with specially insulated material so that people report it is actually toasty warm. Okay, forget the toasty part.</p>

<p>My guess is that I won’t get to sleep in it much, though, because my intention is to be out every night trying to photograph the Northern Lights, which are reported to be putting on quite a show this year.</p>

<p><a href="http://blog.lesterpickerphoto.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/02/LAP1127.jpg"><img class="size-medium wp-image-1946" title="_LAP1127" src="http://blog.lesterpickerphoto.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/02/LAP1127-300x199.jpg" alt="" width="300" height="199"></a></p>

<p>In any event, you’ll be able to follow me again in real time on my travels. I’ll have my SPOT GPS with me and, as usual, I’ll blog from the frozen northlands. While I’m gone, please do me a favor. Stay warm!</p>

		  <div class="entry-content"><p>If you’re a photographer, listen up! Do I have a deal for you!!</p>

<p>To help celebrate Photographers’ Month at my favorite outdoor clothing website— <a href="http://www.scottevest.com">ScotteVest</a> — I’m giving away a brand new Classic ScotteVest to one of our blog visitors! Just be sure to enter <strong>by February 29</strong>. Winners will be announced on March 1.</p>

<p><strong>UPDATE</strong>: The contest is ending soon, folks, so enter your best few images ASAP! There are two main prizes (and who knows what else might be in store for you brave entrants?).</p>

<h3>The Classic ScotteVest</h3>


<p>Why should you want to win this contest? Simply because, in my opinion (humble or otherwise), the Classic ScotteVest is… well, a classic. It has 22 pockets—  count ‘em— with features that never cease to amaze me. There are pockets for my iPhone, point-and-shoot camera, water bottle, sunglasses, pens and passport, even an iPad!</p>

<p><img src="http://www.scottevest.com/media/img/p_tvestm-desert-sand_ndx.jpg" alt="Classic Vest for Men" width="200" height="200"><a href="http://blog.lesterpickerphoto.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/02/pr_scott.jpg"><img class="size-full wp-image-1937" title="pr_scott" src="http://blog.lesterpickerphoto.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/02/pr_scott.jpg" alt="" width="200" height="200"></a></p>

<p>I’ve owned one of these puppies for years and it allows me to breeze through airport security. And here is a little secret; I get to shed about five pounds of technology from my suitcase so I don’t get charged $100 extra (round trip, of course… what a bargain!). The vest is so well balanced I hardly feel it and ScotteVest’s “No Bulge” system keeps everything out of site. Plus, I get to have all my essentials with me.</p>

<p><img src="http://www.scottevest.com/media/img/p_tvestw-desert-sand_ndx.jpg" alt="Travel Vest for Women" width="200" height="200"></p>

<p>The vest sells for $100 online. The winner of my contest will have his or her choice of color and size. Check out the<a href="http://www.scottevest.com/v3_store/New_Travel_Vest.shtml"> men’s vest</a> and the <a href="http://www.scottevest.com/v3_store/New_Travel_Vest_Women.shtml">women’s vest</a>.</p>

<h3>Disclaimer</h3>


<p>I make no bones about, I&#8217;m proud to be the ScotteVest photography columnist on their website. I make no money on anything sold by ScotteVest. I collaborate with them simply because I believe in their products and use their clothing every time I take a photo trip (actually, I also wear their Hoodie at home on chilly days). I was a customer of theirs long before I agreed to do a photography column for them. I do get to test out some of their gear. It’s not only some of the best made outdoor clothing I have ever used, but it’s THE most thoughtfully made. ‘Nuf said.</p>

		  <div class="entry-content"><p>I am so tired of seeing very capable people produce b-o-r-i-n-g photos. The same tourist locations, the same angles, the same composition, the same, same, same!</p>

<p>So, several years ago I got to wondering if there was a better way to help people get beyond boring and into more dynamic expressions of their photographic creativity. I do think I’ve found one path, but first bear me a little slack.</p>

<p>Admittedly, I’m schizophrenic. I’m frequently forced to witness disturbing battles that rage between my left and right brains.</p>

<p><em>Les, you’ve got to be more organized and develop a system to do this. </em></p>

<p><em>No, I need to be more free-flowing, more daringly creative.</em></p>

<p><em>Les, back off and rethink whether getting that shot out on that ledge is a good idea. </em></p>

<p><em>Oooh, that sunset from that ledge would be so gorgeous</em>… you get my point.</p>

<p>From an early age the two things that have always lighted my passion have been writing and photography. As a 5<sup>th</sup>-grader I won a writing competition and at age 11, my father, an accomplished amateur photographer, gave me my first 35mm camera. Since then, my two passions have caused me endless grief, but also too many sublime moments to count. I have written and photographed for some of the top magazines in the country and in each case I believe that the one creative outlet has helped the other.</p>

<p><a href="http://blog.lesterpickerphoto.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/01/luxorwestbank1-21.jpg"><img class="size-medium wp-image-1926" src="http://blog.lesterpickerphoto.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/01/luxorwestbank1-21-200x300.jpg" alt="" width="200" height="300"></a></p>

<p>So, here is my proposed solution to improve your photography. Write a story, and then tell it through your lens. No, I mean it. Cultivate the written side of your creative brain and it might just do wonders for your photography. Let’s see how.</p>

<p>As you travel here and there, take a little notebook and write down your impressions. What captivated you? Was it the people you met, the scenery you saw, the wildlife roaming free in the distance? Use lots of adjectives and adverbs to describe those things. Photography is still primarily a two-dimensional endeavor. Writing puts flesh on the bones, and adds depth and dimensionality to your experience.</p>

<p>The more experience you gain with this process, in other words the more you write, the more you will see the world around you in many hues, in different tonalities, in multiple textures. You will become sensitized to light and movement. You will observe the nuances of wildlife as you have never done before. It’s then the magic begins, perhaps slowly at first, imperceptibly, but it’s there, all right. Your images will stretch to capture the subtleties. You will crave to put on ‘film’ what your senses are recording and in your frustration, you will improve your photographic story-telling or develop new and creative ways to express it.</p>

<p>Suddenly, your images will achieve greater depth. Your color palette will expand or, perhaps even better, shrink to capture the subtle monochromatic tones of a dreary London alleyway. You will selectively blur that animal’s movement to tell your story of its grace. You will wait that extra second for that smudge-faced little girl on a Calcutta street to smile so that you reveal your vision of a more hopeful future.</p>

<p><a href="http://blog.lesterpickerphoto.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/01/LAP0531-1-Edit2.jpg"><img class="size-medium wp-image-1928" src="http://blog.lesterpickerphoto.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/01/LAP0531-1-Edit2-199x300.jpg" alt="" width="199" height="300"></a></p>

<p>Writing and photography are like two parts of the whole. The best images I have ever seen somehow speak their truth to me. A picture, after all, if we are lucky, really can be worth a thousand words. The key here is to always ask yourself this question: What is the story you are trying to tell with your image?</p>

		  <div class="entry-content"><p>I woke up this morning, poured my tea and started reading the paper. It wasn&#8217;t exactly unexpected, but the headline jumped out and grabbed my heart. Kodak was filing for bankruptcy.</p>

<p>I&#8217;ll try to explain what this means to me. I was brought up on Kodak film. My father, a wonderful photographer (and genuinely nice guy) gave me my first camera and rolls of Kodachrome 25 when I was 11. He was a periodic beta-tester for Kodak film, although he rarely used anything other than K25. His photography around New York City was well known. In fact, a few years ago my sister and I agreed to donate some of his work to the Museum of the City of New York.</p>

<p>I remember my first assignments for National Geographic Society publications were shot on K25 and that newfangled film called Kodachrome 64 (good, but never as good as the legendary K25). Once in a while maybe an Ektachrome here and there, although I never liked its bluish cast and grain.</p>

<p><a href="http://blog.lesterpickerphoto.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/01/4204587687_69578f4798.jpg"><img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-1907" title="4204587687_69578f4798" src="http://blog.lesterpickerphoto.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/01/4204587687_69578f4798.jpg" alt="" width="500" height="366"></a></p>

<p>Once, when I was shooting an assignment on sea turtles, the National Park Service called me while I was at a conference and told me that a Loggerhead Turtle nest had washed out on the Shackleford Banks off the coast of North Carolina. If the eggs were not reburied within hours, the amnion might separate from the shell, killing the young. If I didn&#8217;t get there within two hours, I&#8217;d lose the opportunity to shoot the scene. The problem was that I was on the mainland and would never reach the site in time by boat.</p>

<p>A quick call to my editor in Washington, DC and he gave me the go-ahead to charter a helicopter. Unfortunately, I only had one roll of film with me. In my mad dash to the airport, I ran into a tiny drugstore on the Outer Banks.</p>

<p>&#8220;Do you sell film?&#8221; I asked, breathless.</p>

<p>&#8220;Yep,&#8221; the store owner, pharmacist, shelf stocker, soda fountain jerk, and cashier answered. With that he turned around and took out a fresh pack of film from what we used to call a &#8220;brick&#8221; (20 rolls wrapped in cellophane).</p>

<p>&#8220;No, I&#8217;ll take them all!&#8221; I said, grabbed the brick, tossed down a few $20s and ran out of the store. The guy thought I was nuts. Of course, the only film he sold was good ole Kodachrome  (albeit K64). Thats the kind of standard the Kodak brand was in those days (1978). Boy, how the mighty have fallen.</p>

<p>Kodak was an icon for me. A trusted name in American business for generations. Quality all the way. And now this.</p>

<p>I know I&#8217;m as guilty as anyone. I made the switch to digital 7 or 8 years ago. As expensive as digital is today, I remember my last film assignment I shot cost me $1,600 in developing costs alone!</p>

<p>For the past decade I have watched Kodak&#8217;s steady decline. They just did not anticipate the speed with which digital would eventually dominate. They made some dicey moves, such as getting into the printer business. What hair brained consultant, I wonder, convinced them this was wise? Printers are one of the most competitive businesses in photography, with the likes of  HP, Epson, Canon, and Brother barely holding on. Printers are nearly loss leaders nowadays, giveaways, with the business model depending on us constantly filling the pricey ink tanks to generate profits.</p>

<p>Well, there&#8217;s still hope. Perhaps Kodak will recover from their self-inflicted wounds and emerge healthier. I, for one, will be rooting for them.</p>

		  <div class="entry-content"><p>2011 was a pretty good year… photographically, that is. I was able to fulfill a decades-old desire and delve deep into large format photography, only to find that it does not suit my travel style. Bummer. But I had fun finally tackling that beast and putting it to rest.</p>

<p>It was also the year that I added medium format to my repertoire, and I am enjoying my Hasselblad H4D-50 very, very much. With its 50-megapixel files and extraordinary sensor, I get luscious, film-like images that exceed my expectations.</p>

<p>I was also able to travel to some wonderful places for photography this past year- including Canada’s Yukon Territory, Alaska, Zion National Park and New Mexico. I was able to write about these travels and illustrate them with my images both <a href="http://blog.lesterpickerphoto.com/category/travelogue/">here</a> and for a wide range of commercial newspapers and magazines.</p>

<p>And, as it has been for the past three years, I have enjoyed my interactions with my associate, Bob Boyer, who is truly a very talented guy. He is constantly challenging me on a profession level and making things happen for our business.</p>

<h3>Onward to 2012!</h3>


<p>I look forward to 2012 with excitement and a sense of humility. For one thing, my travels will range far and wide, from U.S. locations to Finland (not finalized yet), Israel, Sri Lanka, Iceland, Norway (also not yet finalized), and Maine. Sadly, a planned photo shoot in Africa in January did not pan out due to unrest in Kenya.</p>

<p>I’m also looking forward to more fully incorporating my <a href="http://blog.lesterpickerphoto.com/2011/11/29/review-of-the-hasselblad-h4d-50/">Hasselblad equipment</a> into my workflow. My <a href="http://blog.lesterpickerphoto.com/2010/07/23/canadian-rockies-deciding-what-photo-equipment-to-take/">Nikon system</a>, which I have been using since 1970, is second nature to me and it’s a blessing when your equipment does not get in the way of your creative vision.</p>

<p>This year we will be upgrading my gallery website and adding very exciting new products, so stay tuned.</p>

<p>I have a <a href="http://www.nikoniansacademy.com/all/viewWorkshop.html?workshop_id=107">terrific photography workshop</a> scheduled for October in Maine’s Acadia National Park under the auspices of Nikonians, where I am a member of their Academy faculty. This 4-day event promises to be full of spectacular fall photo opps in my very favorite National Park.</p>

<p><a href="http://blog.lesterpickerphoto.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/01/LAP2300.jpg"><img class="size-full wp-image-1903" title="_LAP2300" src="http://blog.lesterpickerphoto.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/01/LAP2300.jpg" alt="" width="1024" height="680"></a></p>

<p>However, what I’m most excited about for 2012 is having been chosen the creative artist for a major teaching hospital’s newest wing. Opening in September, this will mean choosing, post-processing and mounting nearly 100 of my images, most of them at 36 x 30 and some much larger. One image, in particular, will run 28 feet in length!</p>

<p>What gives me the most pleasure with this project is working with some of the finest hospital construction experts and interior designers I have ever met, along with some very dedicated and compassionate health care workers. Each image must be chosen with care, since this unit is dedicated to traumatic brain injury patients and their families. It’s a challenge that I relish. Of course, I’ll keep you posted as the project progresses.</p>

<p>I spent the time between Christmas and New Year writing down my photography (and business) goals for the year. The question I have for you is: What are your photographic goals? Are you bold enough to share them with us here?</p>

		  <div class="entry-content"><p><strong>O</strong>ne man’s sorrow is another man’s joy, or so the saying goes (I assume it applies equally to women). And so it is in the Yukon Territory, where oil, gas and precious metal interests have discovered that the Canadian province may hold vast, untapped resources. That’s good news for the economy and perhaps bad news for the environment. We’ll soon see.</p>

<p>In winter I usually review some of my past year’s work and, lo and behold!, I found some images that I had forgotten about. Without taking a stand on Yukon’s oil and gas exploration, on my trip there last summer, I happened to pass an oil exploration camp that is on hiatus right now, while the corporate execs seek additional investors. We needed a break from driving anyway, so my fellow photographer Richard Hartmier (<a href="http://www.hartmier.com">www.hartmier.com</a>) and I stopped for maybe 30 very rushed minutes to make some photo impressions of the drilling equipment lying in wait. I attached some photo info, but I can’t attach comments to these images since I have no idea what each piece of equipment is or does. But, here is a photo essay, uninformed as it is. All images here were taken hand-held on a Nikon D700, then post-processed into B&amp;W using Lightroom 3 and, in a few cases, Nik Silver Effects.</p>

		  <div class="entry-content"><p>A friend, Morgan Melekos, just sent me this image he took while I was photographing a Vermont stream scene. It was around 1 degree Fahrenheit that day. Although I sometimes have to get into a stream to photograph, I don&#8217;t do so lightly. I advise my readers to always take proper precautions (see the ScotteVest column I did entitled &#8220;Don&#8217;t Take The Plunge!&#8221;: <a href="http://www.scottevest.com/company/photography.shtml">http://www.scottevest.com/company/photography.shtml</a>).</p>

<p>If you are curious, the camera is a Hasselblad H4D-50 with a 28mm lens and a Hasselblad tilt-shift mechanism between the lens and camera. Clothing includes my ScotteVest hoodie sweatshirt (and two layers underneath). My waders are from Orvis (I use soft-soled waders so I can feel the rocks, which I believe helps me from slipping). My tripod is a Gitzo 3541 with a Really Right Stuff BH-55 ballhead.</p>

		  <div class="entry-content"><p>I was visiting my daughter and 3 grandchildren in Vermont&#8217;s Northern Kingdom this past week. The weather was atrocious, not for the cold, but for the fact that an unusually warm couple of days produced rain instead of snow and washed all the snow from the trees. Man, was I bummed! There went my pre-visualization of a snowy stream.</p>

<p>On my last day I had aborted a trek to a beaver pond when I stepped into a marsh and broke through the ice, filling my boot with ice-cold water and marsh muck (hey, it happens!). One thing I learned from teaching winter survival in Maine is not to play loose with winter conditions. I hiked back to my car, thankful for my ScotteVest alpaca wool socks, which kept me warm.</p>

<p>On the drive out of the preservation area I passed this creek and stopped to take a shot. It was late in the day, the sun was fading fast, so I took a few snaps and left. In 2012, at your requests, I will be including more shooting info, as appropriate. Here goes:</p>

		  <div class="entry-content"><p>Boredom is good! The interstitial seasonitis doldrums have started, that dreadful time for photographers where we are still blinded by Fall’s colors and the snows of winter have yet to fly. Oh, the boredom, the insatiable itchy trigger finger!</p>

<p>Well, you can relieve that boredom with Les Picker’s tried-and-true doldrums destroyer. It’s called an aquarium. Not just any aquarium, but a dry aquarium, aka a terrarium. Here’s what I mean.</p>

<p>Buy a used aquarium (5-10 gallons should suffice) at a yard sale. If one side or other is cracked, so much the better; it’ll cost you less. Go home and clean the glass sides thoroughly… and I mean thoroughly, so that not a speck of dirt or a smudge remains.</p>

<p>Now, carefully fill it with earth, clumps of grass, dried weeds, for whatever scene you’d like to create. Put a fine mesh cover on top of the terrarium. Stick your camera on a tripod right next to a glass side. Add a macro lens or some inexpensive extension rings. Now, add some creepy-crawly things and, voila!, you have a made-to-order boredom reliever.</p>

<p><strong><em>[Warning</em></strong><em>: bringing cold or frozen soil from outside into your warm house will probably cause lots of little critters to hatch and emerge. Hey, that’s good. You’ll never know what new photographic subjects will suddenly be crawling in your aquarium.]</em></p>

<p>Case in point: last year my wife’s tomato plants were bugged by bugs. Not your garden variety (pardon the puns). These bugs were huge. They are called Tomato Hornworms and, while colorful… in fact gorgeous… I hate competition for my wife’s prized tomatoes. These “worms” metamorphose into the spectacular caterpillars you see here.</p>

<p><a href="http://blog.lesterpickerphoto.com/wp-content/uploads/2011/12/LAP3274.jpg" class="lightview" data-lightview-options="skin: 'mac'">
<figure><img src="http://blog.lesterpickerphoto.com/wp-content/uploads/2011/12/LAP3274.jpg">
</figure></a></p>

<p>So, I picked off a few and plunked them into my terrarium. I started to photograph them. Lots of fun. Then, to my amazement, something extraordinary began to happen right before my eyes. While photographing one afternoon, I saw something live emerging from the skin of the worm! Soon, other wiggly things began to emerge. Within hours the poor Hornworm was covered with these translucent worms.</p>

<p><a href="http://blog.lesterpickerphoto.com/wp-content/uploads/2011/12/LAP3549.jpg" class="lightview" data-lightview-options="skin: 'mac'">
<figure><img src="http://blog.lesterpickerphoto.com/wp-content/uploads/2011/12/LAP3549.jpg">
</figure></a></p>

<p>Within minutes of emerging, these tiny creatures spun a cocoon around themselves, all the while attached to the Hornworm. After two weeks of enduring what must be a painful demise, the Hornworm caterpillar died and the cocoons dropped off into the soil.</p>

<p><a href="http://blog.lesterpickerphoto.com/wp-content/uploads/2011/12/LAP3591.jpg" class="lightview" data-lightview-options="skin: 'mac'">
<figure><img src="http://blog.lesterpickerphoto.com/wp-content/uploads/2011/12/LAP3591.jpg">
</figure></a></p>

<p>What I learned after some research is that the tiny wigglies are the larvae of a miniature and harmless (to humans, that is) wasp. On a nice summer’s day the wasp lands on the Hornworm caterpillar and injects its eggs under its victim’s skin, along with a virus that is thought to delay the maturation of the eggs into the larvae (so as to give the caterpillar a chance to fatten up). Over the next few weeks the eggs transform into a larva. At the end of the season the larvae emerge, take sustenance from the caterpillar’s body, form cocoons that drop into the soil, go through another metamorphosis into wasps and emerge again in the spring. Is that neat, or what? I’d never have learned about this parasitic lifecycle if not for boredom.</p>

<figure><img src="http://blog.lesterpickerphoto.com/wp-content/uploads/2011/12/LAP3429.jpg">
</figure></a></p>

<p>So, what will you do with your photo doldrums this year? Complain? Whine? Be short-tempered with your wife and kids? Not any more. Boredom is good!</p>

		  <div class="entry-content"><p>I’ve been visiting global cold weather spots for many years and there is no question in my mind that climate change is occurring. From melting permafrost to retreating glaciers, I see this every time I venture north.</p>

<p>I am not taking sides on how much is human-induced and how much is naturally occurring. From the data I have seen so far, I am convinced that human activity has accelerated this process. But I also believe that more research is needed on this vital issue that will affect humanity and our natural world for perhaps thousands of years.</p>

<p>An article on melting permafrost in today’s <a href="http://www.nytimes.com/2011/12/17/science/earth/warming-arctic-permafrost-fuels-climate-change-worries.html?_r=1&amp;hp">New York Times</a> triggered a memory for me of my most recent visit to the Yukon Territory in Canada’s northern regions. Driving on the famed Dempster Highway I noticed for the first time immense tree slides occurring on mountainsides.</p>

<p>In fact, I stopped at one point to take a quick snapshot of a relatively small one.</p>

<p><a href="http://blog.lesterpickerphoto.com/wp-content/uploads/2011/12/LAP_57101.jpg" class="lightview" data-lightview-options="skin: 'mac'">
<figure><img src="http://blog.lesterpickerphoto.com/wp-content/uploads/2011/12/LAP_57101.jpg">
</figure></a></p>

<p>These slides are occurring with increasing frequency throughout the polar region, as the permafrost melts and shallow-rooted trees on hillsides give way, especially after summer rains. It’s a real pity to see such devastation and scarring happening in such pristine and fragile environments.</p>

		  <div class="entry-content"><p>I guess it was bound to happen. After years of pounding the trails with a 30-lb camera pack on my back, several months ago I developed Plantar fasciitis. It&#8217;s now been 4 months of treatment including two rounds of cortisone injections, icing the affected area, anti-inflammatory meds and $550 worth of orthotics and I&#8217;m still in pain. I just left the podiatrist&#8217;s office today and will now begin a 6-week try at physical therapy before we go to DEFCON 6, which I understand to be a radical therapy involving beating the bottoms of my feet with electrical shock waves. Ooowie! Sounds like fun.</p>

<p>Anyway, on the extremely remote chance that you might be interested, the plantar fascia, to quote PubMed, is &#8220;&#8230;a very thick band of tissue that covers the bones on the bottom of the foot. It extends from the heel to the bones of the ball of the foot and acts like a rubber band to create tension which maintains the arch of the foot. If the band is long it allows the arch of the foot to be low, which is most commonly known as having a flat foot. A short band of tissue causes a high arch. This fascia can become inflamed and painful in some people, making walking more difficult.&#8221;</p>

</figure></a></div>


<div></div>


<div>The problem for me is that I still have to bring back the goods, so I end up re-injuring the foot (now both feet). Makes no difference if I&#8217;m hiking in Zion National Park with my 30+ pounds of camera gear or walking the streets of NYC as I did a few weeks ago. By the end of the day I&#8217;m in pain.</div>


<div></div>


<div>If any of you have experience with Plantar fasciitis, please let me know how you cured it. In the meantime, please send your good wishes into the ether that the physical therapy works. I&#8217;d like to avoid DEFCON 6 if at all possible.</div>

		  <div class="entry-content"><p>I continue to test out my Hasselblad H4D-50 as I prepare for a major installation of my work in a Baltimore teaching hospital. Part of that installation will involve taking images of iconic Baltimore scenes, a process that Bob (my associate) and I have already begun. Whenever the weather is nice we run down to Baltimore and grab some shots, each time hopefully ticking off another site from our lengthy list.</p>

<p>Here are a few images taken with the Hassy, along with some background info for those of you who might be interested. The images have not been seriously post-processed, but they have been tweaked as part of our experimentation. All images were taken tripod-mounted.</p>

</figure></a></p>

<p>As always, your comments, positive or negative, are welcome.</p>

<p>This image of the iconic Domino Sugars sign in Baltimore&#8217;s Inner Harbor was taken at twilight. ISO 200, f8, 1/8 sec, 50-110 lens @ 110mm. No post-processing used.</p>

<p><a href="http://blog.lesterpickerphoto.com/wp-content/uploads/2011/12/B0017446-Edit.jpg"><img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-1816" title="B0017446-Edit" src="http://blog.lesterpickerphoto.com/wp-content/uploads/2011/12/B0017446-Edit.jpg" alt="" width="1024" height="768"></a></p>

<p>Another shot of the sign and factory after dark. ISO 200, f5.6, .3 sec, 50-110 lens @ 70mm. No post-processing with exception of neon sign itself, which Bob had to restore to its original color &amp; illumination in PhotoShop.</p>

<p><a href="http://blog.lesterpickerphoto.com/wp-content/uploads/2011/12/A0017573-Edit.jpg"><img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-1817" title="A0017573-Edit" src="http://blog.lesterpickerphoto.com/wp-content/uploads/2011/12/A0017573-Edit.jpg" alt="" width="768" height="1024"></a></p>

<p>This shot of The Peabody Institute&#8217;s library (part of The Johns Hopkins University) was taken with existing light only. The Peabody library is one of my favorite locations in Baltimore. Due to its Harry Potter-esque imagery, I tweaked it a bit with tonal adjustment in Nik software. ISO 100, f32, 32 sec, 28mm. I cannot believe that the people in the image stood/sat in one place long enough to register on the image!</p>

<p><a href="http://blog.lesterpickerphoto.com/wp-content/uploads/2011/12/A0017553-Edit.jpg"><img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-1818" title="A0017553-Edit" src="http://blog.lesterpickerphoto.com/wp-content/uploads/2011/12/A0017553-Edit.jpg" alt="" width="1024" height="768"></a></p>

<p>This shot was also taken with existing light only. I shot this with my Hassy 28mm lens, which is the 35mm equivalent of 22mm (wow, that does sound confusing; I&#8217;ll explain it in a future blog). I did not use my tilt-shift mechanism, which explains the walls leaning backwards. I plan to reshoot it next week. Still, I kind of like the image. What do you think?</p>

<p>Again, I tweaked this with tonal adjustments in Nik software. ISO 200, f11, 1 sec, 28mm lens. I shot at ISO 200 so I&#8217;d have a chance at capturing the students studying in the cubicles.</p>

		  <div class="entry-content"><p>My recent addition of a Hasselblad H4D-50 camera system to my trusty Nikon system may have been a good move photographically (see my Hassy review:  <a href="http://blog.lesterpickerphoto.com/2011/11/29/review-of-the-hasselblad-h4d-50/">http://blog.lesterpickerphoto.com/2011/11/29/review-of-the-hasselblad-h4d-50/</a>), but as far as my back goes, not so much.</p>

<p>I realized that trying to cart around a full Hassy system, or a few Hassy components in addition to my Nikon equipment, would be a chiropractic nightmare using my existing backpacks, none of which has the profusion of modern high tech design elements. Plus, neither my ThinkTank Rotation 360, nor any of my other LowePro packs were roomy enough to squeeze in all my field gear, which I suspect engage in illicit acts at night when my supply closet is closed and hence multiply logarithmically.</p>

<p>At a recent PhotoPlus convention in the Big Apple, I came across the LowePro Trekker AW 400. Truthfully, I had already narrowed my search to it and two other packs, all three of which I got a chance to examine on the convention floor. But with the AW400, it was love at first sight. And, once I tried it on and felt its glove-tight custom fit, I was sold.</p>

<p><a href="http://blog.lesterpickerphoto.com/wp-content/uploads/2011/12/lowepro_pro_trekker_aw_400_20100721_135609_image.jpg"><img class="size-full wp-image-1801 " title="lowepro_pro_trekker_aw_400_20100721_135609_image" src="http://blog.lesterpickerphoto.com/wp-content/uploads/2011/12/lowepro_pro_trekker_aw_400_20100721_135609_image.jpg" alt="" width="172" height="200"></a></p>

<h3>Fitting</h3>


<p>When it was delivered to my home, I immediately tried it on and spent the next 30 minutes fine-tuning it to my body. Believe me, there are tons of adjustments available on the pack so that a tweak here and there enhance the comfort level enormously. One nifty feature that I have never seen on a photo backpack before is an adjustment allowing you to raise the pack up or down while keeping the suspension system in place. That adjustment made a world of difference to me during my one-week trip to Zion National Park.</p>

<p><a href="http://blog.lesterpickerphoto.com/wp-content/uploads/2011/12/LAP4224.jpg"><img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-1802" title="_LAP4224" src="http://blog.lesterpickerphoto.com/wp-content/uploads/2011/12/LAP4224.jpg" alt="" width="1024" height="681"></a></p>

<h3>Innovative Features</h3>


<p>I was blown away by how much I could squeeze into the AW400. It has big pockets, little pockets, front pockets and side pockets, even pockets inside pockets. The exterior shell is water resistant, which I can readily attest to after hiking in a constant rain. There is unlimited flexibility in arranging dividers and it easily fits my Nikon 200-400. Of course the trick is to not load a pack so much that it makes it impossible to hike long distances with it. That’s especially true for my 60-year old body. But, while the AW400 is indeed a large pack, it is not unwieldy. It slid onto my shoulders easily and with two quick strap adjustments I was off. And the way the AW 400 distributes the weight allowed me to cart an extra 10 pounds with me without feeling it.</p>

<p><a href="http://blog.lesterpickerphoto.com/wp-content/uploads/2011/12/LAP4220.jpg"><img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-1803" title="_LAP4220" src="http://blog.lesterpickerphoto.com/wp-content/uploads/2011/12/LAP4220.jpg" alt="" width="1024" height="681"></a></p>

<p>Another innovative feature that I enjoy is the top section of the bag. It contains two pockets that I use to store snack foods, hat, gloves and other extras.</p>

<p><a href="http://blog.lesterpickerphoto.com/wp-content/uploads/2011/12/LAP4225.jpg"><img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-1804" title="_LAP4225" src="http://blog.lesterpickerphoto.com/wp-content/uploads/2011/12/LAP4225.jpg" alt="" width="1024" height="681"></a></p>

<p>The neat thing is that the entire section is removable and morphs into a fully functional fanny pack for those days when you want to roam around town without all your photo gear. In the field what I do is wear the bag as a fanny pack even when I use the AW400. That way I can get to my extras without taking off the pack. Very convenient!</p>

<p><a href="http://blog.lesterpickerphoto.com/wp-content/uploads/2011/12/LAP4230.jpg"><img class="size-full wp-image-1805" title="_LAP4230" src="http://blog.lesterpickerphoto.com/wp-content/uploads/2011/12/LAP4230.jpg" alt="" width="1024" height="681"></a></p>

<p>There are also lots of places to which you can attach carabiners or other hardware. I use one shoulder ring to attach my SPOT GPS and the other for my filter holder.</p>

<p>Another item I enjoyed was the tiny, but well constructed, organizer bag that comes with the AW400. It’s one more thoughtful nod to the pro or advanced amateur photographer from LowePro. I find it perfect for all my adapter rings and one of my filter holders. Now they’re not clattering all over my bag.</p>

<p>The main waist belt on the AW400 includes lots of attachment points for extra pouches, a can of bear spray or to whatever else you might want quick access.</p>

<h3>Water</h3>


<p>I’ve never had a Camelback water system in a backpack before. The designers at LowePro include a side pocket that allows one to slip in a Camelback that neatly threads through the pocket and onto one of the shoulder straps. What a pleasure it was to be able to draw water whenever I needed it without having to stop and fish out my water bottle!</p>

<h3>Tripod Holder</h3>


<p>I’m not sure if it’s me, or the design of photo backpacks in general, but I have never liked the tripod carrying mechanisms they offer, and I’ve owned literally dozens of packs in my career. The tripod carry significantly shifts the center of gravity backwards and pulls the pack away from my body, making the pack feel awkward and heavier. The AW400 is no exception and I quickly shifted to my regular routine of carrying my tripod in my hand or slung over my shoulder with camera mounted.</p>

<h3>Laptop</h3>


<p>As if all these features weren’t enough, the AW400 includes a laptop sleeve and comes equipped with a thin, padded laptop bag. For me that meant that the AW400 was all I needed for an airplane carry-on. Worked like a charm.</p>

<p><a href="http://blog.lesterpickerphoto.com/wp-content/uploads/2011/12/LAP4231.jpg"><img class="size-full wp-image-1806" title="_LAP4231" src="http://blog.lesterpickerphoto.com/wp-content/uploads/2011/12/LAP4231.jpg" alt="" width="681" height="1024"></a></p>

<h3>Final Thoughts</h3>


<p>I would award the AW400 4.5 stars based on its plethora of features and its rugged construction (I suspect I would only award a backpack 5 stars if it came with a porter). The Pro Trekker AW series includes a smaller (AW300) and larger (AW600) version and I anticipate getting the AW300 for times when I am hiking light.</p>

<p>The AW400 is not cheap, at around $250. If you do a Google search, you’ll find some videos available showing the features of the Pro Trekker AW series.</p>

		  <div class="entry-content"><p>I promised you a field report on my new Hasselblad H4D-50 system after I returned from a trip to Zion National Park where I used it exclusively and extensively. Here it is. One small caution, though; all the scenic images here I shot with my Hassy. However, they have been compressed to ridiculous small sizes in order to accommodate WordPress’ requirements (see file size descriptions, below). So don’t expect to see marked differences between the Hassy images and my Nikon images in this venue. Enlarged for wall displays, the differences are huge. <strong>You may need to click on each image to see the entire image as they may be cropped to fit the WordPress template. </strong>Anyway, here goes&#8230;</p>

<p><a href="http://blog.lesterpickerphoto.com/wp-content/uploads/2011/11/United_Kingdom_Hasselblad_H3DII_50_Multi_Shot_System_Digital_SLR_Camera722009114456PM5.jpg"><img class="size-full wp-image-1785" title="United_Kingdom_Hasselblad_H3DII_50_Multi_Shot_System_Digital_SLR_Camera722009114456PM5" src="http://blog.lesterpickerphoto.com/wp-content/uploads/2011/11/United_Kingdom_Hasselblad_H3DII_50_Multi_Shot_System_Digital_SLR_Camera722009114456PM5.jpg" alt="" width="345" height="345"></a></p>

<p>Hasselblad is what is known as a medium format system, meaning that it records an image much larger than does a 35mm camera. My Nikon D700, for example, produces an image with 12 megapixels (MP) of information packed into its file. A Nikon D3X produces 25-MP images. My Hasselblad cranks out full 16-bit images with 50 MP of information.</p>

<p><a href="http://blog.lesterpickerphoto.com/wp-content/uploads/2011/11/2011-11-Zion_0283-Edit.jpg"><img class="size-full wp-image-1780" title="2011-11-Zion_0283-Edit" src="http://blog.lesterpickerphoto.com/wp-content/uploads/2011/11/2011-11-Zion_0283-Edit.jpg" alt="" width="1024" height="768"></a></p>

<p>Most people will never need files that large if they post their images on the Web or make enlargements up to 16 x 24, for example. As a professional, I frequently have to blow up my images to insane sizes for my clients. We recently produced a 5-feet by nine-feet image for a restaurant! Stretching a 12-MP Nikon file to that high a magnification is not ideal. A Hasselblad file is better suited to the enlargements that I do, typically 24” x 36” up to 40” x 50”.</p>

<p><a href="http://blog.lesterpickerphoto.com/wp-content/uploads/2011/11/2011-11-Zion_0323-Edit.jpg"><img class="size-full wp-image-1781" title="2011-11-Zion_0323-Edit" src="http://blog.lesterpickerphoto.com/wp-content/uploads/2011/11/2011-11-Zion_0323-Edit.jpg" alt="" width="768" height="1024"></a></p>

<p>For my visit to Zion National Park in Utah I decided to take ONLY my Hassy system so that I would not fall back on my trusty Nikons if I felt frustrated by unfamiliar Hassy controls. It turns out that was a good decision, because I had many frustrations during the week-long adventure. Of course I’ve been shooting Nikon for 40 years, so I naturally had some readjusting to do.</p>

<p><a href="http://blog.lesterpickerphoto.com/wp-content/uploads/2011/11/2011-11-Zion_B_16822-Edit-Edit-Edit.jpg"><img class="size-full wp-image-1782" title="2011-11-Zion_B_16822-Edit-Edit-Edit" src="http://blog.lesterpickerphoto.com/wp-content/uploads/2011/11/2011-11-Zion_B_16822-Edit-Edit-Edit.jpg" alt="" width="1024" height="768"></a></p>

<p>I took along my Hassy body, along with the following Hassy lenses: 50-110mm, 120mm macro, 80mm, and 28mm. In medium format the lenses produce an image equivalent to 25% shorter in 35mm format, so that the 28mm, for example, equals a 22mm field of coverage. I packed all this gear into a LowePro Trekker 400AW backpack, which is one workhorse of a backpack (see my review on the LowePro in an upcoming blog).</p>

<p>Here’s what I learned from my experience. First, the Hassy equipment is heavy to trek, mostly due to two of my lenses. In the future I will most definitely leave my 120mm macro home unless I plan to spend the day emphasizing macro shots, in which case I’ll probably leave the 50-110 home. Both lenses weigh in at a whopping 4.5 pounds.</p>

<p><a href="http://blog.lesterpickerphoto.com/wp-content/uploads/2011/11/images.jpeg"><img class="size-full wp-image-1784 " title="images" src="http://blog.lesterpickerphoto.com/wp-content/uploads/2011/11/images.jpeg" alt="" width="303" height="166"></a></p>

<p>Jumping ahead, the bottom line is that I absolutely love the images the Hassy produced on this trip. The dynamic range is tremendous, far broader than what I’m used to on my Nikons, and the tonality (actually, the tonal gradation) is nothing short of sweet. The files have an almost film-like quality to them. And, they are huge. Given that I love the results, I’m willing to put up with what I see as its flaws for a landscape/travel photographer.</p>

<p><a href="http://blog.lesterpickerphoto.com/wp-content/uploads/2011/11/2011-11-Zion_A_16893-Edit.jpg"><img class="size-full wp-image-1786" title="2011-11-Zion_A_16893-Edit" src="http://blog.lesterpickerphoto.com/wp-content/uploads/2011/11/2011-11-Zion_A_16893-Edit.jpg" alt="" width="1024" height="768"></a></p>

<h3>Pluses and Minuses</h3>


<p>First, some additional pluses. The camera-lens combo, while heavy, has a solid, organic feel in my hand. The handle also serves as the battery and its rubbery grip is secure and comfortable. I do most of my work on a tripod, so this was a secondary benefit to me.</p>

<p>A more immediate plus is the bright, large viewfinder that gave me clear views even in low light situations. The shutter gives a resounding, positive response. Mirror lock-up is easy, once I programmed one of the buttons for that function.</p>

<p>On the other hand, the rechargeable batteries do not come close to Nikon’s batteries in terms of usage. I used to be able to go an entire day on a Nikon battery. With my Hassy, I went through 3 batteries on a couple of days and two batteries on others. I’ll have to buy another battery just to play safe, but at $200+ each that’s painful.</p>

<p>The H4D-50 only offers Live View (what they call Live Video) while tethered to a computer. That’s obviously of no use to a landscape photographer. Hassy needs to up its game and offer us untethered live view to allow for critical focusing, especially while using its tilt-shift mechanism with closeups or when placing foreground elements into a scenic.</p>

<p><a href="http://blog.lesterpickerphoto.com/wp-content/uploads/2011/11/2011-11-Zion_0317-Edit.jpg"><img class="size-full wp-image-1787" title="2011-11-Zion_0317-Edit" src="http://blog.lesterpickerphoto.com/wp-content/uploads/2011/11/2011-11-Zion_0317-Edit.jpg" alt="" width="768" height="1024"></a></p>

<p>Probably the biggest issue I had with my Hassy in the field is that it only has one auto-focus point, dead center in the frame. That’s no problem for fashion shooters, because most of them shoot hand-held. You aim, focus and recompose. Simple. Hassy does offer an innovative feature called True Focus. You focus on your subject and hold the True Focus button. Then, as you recompose, the camera uses its built-in gyroscopes to compensate for the change in angle, resulting in ultra-precise focusing capability. Very cool.</p>

<p>Most of my landscapes are shot on a tripod, where it’s inconvenient to focus, hold the button, fiddle with the tripod ball head controls, retighten, and shoot. Hassy needs to add focus points to its features list if they want to capture more of the outdoor market.</p>

<p><a href="http://blog.lesterpickerphoto.com/wp-content/uploads/2011/11/2011-11-Zion_A_17103-Edit-Edit.jpg"><img class="size-full wp-image-1788" title="2011-11-Zion_A_17103-Edit-Edit" src="http://blog.lesterpickerphoto.com/wp-content/uploads/2011/11/2011-11-Zion_A_17103-Edit-Edit.jpg" alt="" width="768" height="1024"></a></p>

<p>One quirk that I should mention is that the Hassy does not offer noise reduction in camera. That’s good in the sense that your image pops up in the viewfinder immediately after the mirror flips back. The bad news is that images shot in very low light or with long exposures show up with red, green and blue dots on the LCD screen after the shot is taken. Not to worry, though. When imported into Phocus (or Lightroom) the dots disappear due to the software’s inherent noise reduction.</p>

<p><a href="http://blog.lesterpickerphoto.com/wp-content/uploads/2011/11/2011-11-Zion_A_17370-Edit.jpg"><img class="size-full wp-image-1789" title="2011-11-Zion_A_17370-Edit" src="http://blog.lesterpickerphoto.com/wp-content/uploads/2011/11/2011-11-Zion_A_17370-Edit.jpg" alt="" width="1024" height="768"></a></p>

<p>So, all in all, I’m very satisfied with my Hasselblad and the stunning images it produces. After all, isn’t that what photography is about? I can put up with some inconvenience if the end result is an image I can take pride in.</p>

<p>As always, I welcome comments and critiques of my images.</p>

		  <div class="entry-content"><p>I’ve been a bit spotty blogging lately, but lots has been happening on my side of the screen. Perhaps even too much. Managing a photography business isn’t easy in today’s world, especially with the high degree of travel that landscape/nature/travel photography entails. While I’m away things tend to pile up.</p>

<p>I guess the biggest thing to report is that due to the addition of a Hasselblad system, in addition to my Nikon system, I have had to make major changes to my workflow. The biggest news is that I am in the midst of converting from Aperture 3 to Lightroom 3 for my post-processing.</p>

<p><a href="http://blog.lesterpickerphoto.com/wp-content/uploads/2011/11/lightroom3.jpg"><img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-1777" title="lightroom3" src="http://blog.lesterpickerphoto.com/wp-content/uploads/2011/11/lightroom3.jpg" alt="" width="500" height="500"></a></p>

<p>This comes as a shock to some of my followers, since I’ve been an Aperture advocate for years. It’s an exemplary post-processing program and has served me well. Hasselblad has its own processing system, called Phocus, and it is a good program for certain tasks. It interprets the Hassy raw files particularly well, much as NX2 does for Nikon’s raw files. But Lightroom is more sophisticated and handles a broad range of post-processing tasks. My associate, Bob Boyer, and I have tested Lightroom 3 and find it handles the Hassy and Nikon files excellently.</p>

<p>Aperture distinguishes itself in its organizational abilities. Frankly, I have never used its highly sophisticated organization to its fullest. Lightroom 3 seems to follow my workflow a bit more organically. So far I like it.</p>

<p>Frankly, I don’t do a whole lot of post-processing work. I intentionally shoot with the most neutral settings possible, as I do not want the camera to make decisions for me. That usually means that I have to tweak saturation, contrast and, of course, add sharpening, depending on my output. I always seem to have dust on my sensor or water vapor on my lens, so I all too often have to clear them up. I might crop here or there, but that’s about it. I have never bothered to learn PhotoShop, so I can’t even envision all the manipulations I could do to an image.</p>

<p>Unfortunately, the switch to Lightroom also entails a change in my backup routine, and Bob and I are in the midst of that process right now. As always, I’ll keep you posted on my post-processing software changes. In the meantime, if any of you have had experience changing from Aperture to Lightroom, I appreciate you sharing your story with us.</p>

<p>Thanks and happy shooting!</p>

		  <div class="entry-content"><p>Let&#8217;s admit it, we&#8217;re now in one of photography&#8217;s seasonal doldrums. Fall foliage is over, the trees are bare and snow has not hit much of the area, at least not in the mid-Atlantic, USA, region. This is the perfect time for checking out new equipment, innovative techniques, even changes in attitude toward whatever area of photography you have up to now avoided. In my sporadic &#8220;Homework&#8221; series (use the search box to find others), I&#8217;d like to add the perfect assignment for that rainy Saturday morning.</p>

<h3>Depth of Field</h3>


<p>Manipulating depth of field is an important tool in your photographic toolbox. Some photographers have a hard time visioning its effects when they are actually in the field photographing. Most photographers, if they use bracketing at all, will bracket up and down a stop to get the correct exposure, but how many of you also bracket to experiment with depth of field?</p>

<p>Again, on a snowy or rainy day, take out your camera and mount it on a tripod. You can do this with a hand-held camera, but it works better using a tripod. Get a yardstick or a tape measure and lay it out on a table. Now stand up a folded playing card (actually, almost any object will do) at the zero point and a couple of inches left or right of the ruler. Take 4 or 5 other cards and place them at 3-inch intervals behind the first card, staggering them closer and closer to the ruler.</p>

<p>Set up your camera-tripod at eye level to the cards. Switch to Aperture-Priority. Focus on the very first card. Starting with f2.8, and without moving your setup, take a photo at each successive f-stop (i.e.: 2.8, 4, 5.6, 8, 11, 16, 22). You may need a cable release to prevent camera shake. Now enlarge the images in-camera or transfer them to your computer to learn from them.</p>

<p>This is also the perfect time of year to conduct this experiment outdoors, since trees are bare of leaves. In a forested area, set up near a tree that has lots of other trees in the background. Shoot as explained above and note the results. This will give you a good idea of how depth of field affects an image&#8217;s mood and presentation. Do you want to blur the background to achieve your desired effect of isolating your subject? Or, do you want a rich, detailed image that shows clear focus from front to back. The more you experiment with depth of field, the better you will become at pre-visualzing its effects on your photography.</p>

<p>In the following image, I was attracted to this tree that somehow managed to flourish in such a precarious environment, growing from cracks in the rock poised near the edge of the Grand Canyon. I pre-visualized the image I wanted and knew that if I shot wide open, meaning at f/2.8, 4 or 5.6, the background would render blurry and unrecognizable. So I shot at f/11 and 16, as shown here. I like the effect of placing the gnarled tree in the context of its magnificent setting.</p>

<p>In order to see the practical applications of this, go to my blog post on shooting in aperture priority: <a href="http://blog.lesterpickerphoto.com/2009/11/02/best-way-to-improve-your-images-try-shooting-in-aperture-priority/">http://blog.lesterpickerphoto.com/2009/11/02/best-way-to-improve-your-images-try-shooting-in-aperture-priority/</a>.</p>

		  <div class="entry-content"><p>First the good news. My thumb surgery appears as if it is heading for success. My cast came off, my Physical Therapy in Sue&#8217;s capable hands is going well. While in Zion National Park I was able to use my left hand to support my heavy Hasselblad camera-zoom lens combinations with just a little soreness by day&#8217;s end. So, there&#8217;s much to be grateful for in that arena.</p>

<p>The bad news is that I ran into some viral bug on Monday and by Tuesday it had me laid low. Apparently this has been making the rounds in my part of the country, according to my internist. Severe sore throat, coughing, headache, chills, but no fever. My throat was painfully sore for 4 days. Today is my first day back on the job, but subpar is still the operative word.</p>

<p>This week I will post my first review of my Hasselblad H4D-50, so any of you medium format folks may want to check in for that.</p>

<p><a href="http://blog.lesterpickerphoto.com/wp-content/uploads/2011/11/671884.jpg"><img class="size-full wp-image-1767" title="671884" src="http://blog.lesterpickerphoto.com/wp-content/uploads/2011/11/671884.jpg" alt="" width="345" height="345"></a></p>

		  <div class="entry-content"><p>I’m sitting on the deck of my motel room in Zion National Park. Thankfully, I was able to recover from my back spasm within 48 hours and so rebooked my flight and arrived two days late, just grateful to be here. After a day of photographing the gorgeous scenery, I fell ill to altitude sickness and dehydration, two maladies to which I have always been susceptible. Headache, vertigo, yuckiness. So my morning was spent in bed, trying to make believe that there is an alternative reality somewhere in space and time, one where I was happily traipsing through the fall leaves.</p>

<p>I recovered enough in late afternoon to venture out for some sunset images, but by time we got organized we had missed the opportunity. So we had dinner, reconnoitered and went for a nighttime shoot at Canyon Overlook. The moon is nearly full tonight, so we thought it would be a great place. The hike was invigorating, but downright dangerous in places. Most drop-offs were protected by rails, but not all. But the night was still and crisp and the moon cast an ethereal glow over the entire valley. Here is a short video clip of my photo buddy, Daniel Stainer, at one of the overlook bridges.</p>

<p><a title="Canyon Overlook at Night" href="http://youtu.be/9QJuRYGYaig">http://youtu.be/9QJuRYGYaig </a></p>

<p>Since I’ve not been to Zion National Park before, I was really looking forward to this visit. I’m using this visit to field test my new Hasselblad H4D-50. In fact, I left all my Nikon equipment at home so this was a cold turkey test. No alternate reality option available.</p>

<p><a href="http://blog.lesterpickerphoto.com/wp-content/uploads/2011/11/Job_0142-1.jpg"><img class="size-full wp-image-1758" title="Job_0142 (1)" src="http://blog.lesterpickerphoto.com/wp-content/uploads/2011/11/Job_0142-1.jpg" alt="" width="480" height="640"></a></p>

<p>I also bought a new backpack for the trip, a LowePro Trekker 400 AW, as my Hassy equipment is bulkier than my Nikon gear. I’ll review the backpack and explain more about this Hassy test in a coming blog, where I’ll summarize what I see as strengths and weaknesses of the Hassy system for landscape and nature photographers. Very briefly, the files the Hassy system produces seem incredible to my eyes, but there are definite “issues” with using it in the field. Some of them are undoubtedly due to my stubbornness and to my intricate knowledge of Nikon products. It’s hard to teach an old dog new tricks.</p>

<p>For now, here are some impressions of Zion NP. Keep in mind that I am visiting after the high summer season, so I did not experience the legendary crowds and forced shuttle bus system that prevails in summer. Instead, every manner of photographic workshop seems to be in progress right now. Few of the iconic sites were free of photographers. That meant that Dan Stainer and I had to hike to locations where we would have fewer crowds, although according to the locals, “crowds” is a highly subjective word.</p>

<p>Zion NP is drop-dead gorgeous at this time of year. At the far northern end of the park, near Colob Canyon, the leaves have already changed, so we were presented with snow-flecked mountains amidst golden sunsets. Farther south, in Springdale, near the main entrance to the park, the yellows and reds of autumn are just now putting on their show.</p>

<p>I spent an afternoon hiking in the Checkerboard Mesa section of the park. Here is a short video of the area I was in. The rock formations here are wonderful to behold, eye candy wherever you look.</p>

<p><a title="Checkerboard Mesa area" href="http://youtu.be/aO7PcIoN3IY">http://youtu.be/aO7PcIoN3IY</a></p>

<p>Hope you all have a wonderful weekend!</p>

		  <div class="entry-content"><p>What a bummer! Instead of leaving for Zion National Park for a glorious week of photography, I&#8217;m on the couch, alternating between a heating pad and ice packs, along with doses of muscle relaxants and pain killers. Yesterday evening I pulled my back out, but thought it was minor. When I woke up, ready to go to the airport, I couldn&#8217;t even walk. My back had spasmed and I was in pretty extreme pain.</p>

<p><a href="http://blog.lesterpickerphoto.com/wp-content/uploads/2011/11/photo.jpg"><img class="size-full wp-image-1754" title="photo" src="http://blog.lesterpickerphoto.com/wp-content/uploads/2011/11/photo.jpg" alt="" width="640" height="480"></a></p>

<p>Tonight I feel considerably better, so I&#8217;m in hopes that I&#8217;ll just be delayed a couple of days and will be able to join my buddy, Dan Stainer, by Tuesday. I&#8217;ve been looking forward to this trip and the chance to truly field test my Hasselblad system. But that entails me carting around a 30-lb backpack, so I guess I&#8217;ll just have to heal first.</p>

		  <div class="entry-content"><p>If you wonder what the state of photography is and where it is headed, PhotoPlus was the place to be last week. The annual show was held at the Jacob Javits convention center in New York City. It was not just huge, it was mammoth. Vendors of every major camera brand had large, walk-through display booths. Accessory makers had tables or even, in some cases, display booths themselves. Thousands of people streamed through the show.</p>

<p><a href="http://blog.lesterpickerphoto.com/wp-content/uploads/2011/11/Unknown.jpeg"><img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-1744" title="Unknown" src="http://blog.lesterpickerphoto.com/wp-content/uploads/2011/11/Unknown.jpeg" alt="" width="160" height="64"></a></p>

<p><a href="http://blog.lesterpickerphoto.com/wp-content/uploads/2011/11/Unknown.jpeg"></a>There were several developments that impressed me. Of course, digital photography will continue to evolve, much to the consternation of pros, myself included, who see these cameras as supplanting some (but thankfully not all) of our work. What has happened is that our experience, with matters like controlling dynamic range, focus control and others, are now being reduced to masterful algorithms that are handled by the camera’s onboard computers. When people complain to me about the cost of these new engineering marvels I have to smile.</p>

<p>What impressed me the most was how the accessory market has evolved. I spent most of my convention floor time handling the new, sensuous print papers that have come on market. Classic names like Ilford, Museo, Hahnemuhle are producing incredible papers that bring out the best of inkjet printers. But newer names like Canson and Awagami Factory have luscious products that wowed me. Needless to say my associate Bob and I will be doing a lot of experimenting this year.</p>

<p>We also spent lots of time at Hasselblad’s offsite facility, where I was again wowed by customer service and value-added workshops and discussions that continue to help me climb the learning curve for using my new H4D-50 camera and lenses in creative ways. So far I have to tell you that I am so impressed with Hasselblad’s ability to handle dynamic range and interpret it in almost a film-like manner. I’ll be blogging a lot about that in the future as I share successes and failures.</p>

<p>A few “wins” from PhotoPlus. I was able to connect in person with a Nikon technician named Jim Crawley who has worked for Nikon for 46 years! Jim knew my Uncle Morris, who was an independent, but legendary Nikon repairman himself. My uncle has been dead for many years now, so it was a real treat for me to make the connection. A funny story is that I had a colleague who I taught with at the University of Delaware in the eighties. His old mechanical Nikon broke and he sent it in for repair. They sent him a message saying that they could not repair it, but there was a man in New York City who could. You bet; it was my Uncle Morris!</p>

<p>I also got to connect with people who I deal with regularly, but who up to now were email addresses or an anonymous phone voice. I’m the kind of person who appreciates face-to-face, having grown up in the pre-Internet world.</p>

<p>Final observation is about equipment versus technique. Throughout the convention hall, exhibitors set up mini-theaters for their guest lecturers. Nikon had live models for people to try out their equipment. I was impressed by how well attended these demonstrations, lectures, workshops and live shoots were. Here is a video clip of the Nikon exhibit showing people watching a live demonstration.</p>

<p>http://youtu.be/YxYUZTrlJDI</p>

<p>People are obviously eager for ways to improve their photography, to better express themselves creatively in a world that stresses uniformity. My hat is off to all those who were there to learn.</p>

<p>If you are a photo enthusiast, think about attending one of these shows. I know you will get a lot out of it.</p>

		  <div class="entry-content"><p>I leave tomorrow for a week photographing in Zion National Park, a location I have long been wanting to visit. No, I’ve never been before. So many choices, so little time.</p>

<p>I’ll be traveling with my friend and colleague Daniel Stainer, a very advanced amateur (I consider him a pro and have featured him before in my blog: <a href="http://blog.lesterpickerphoto.com/2011/04/25/through-the-eyes-of-daniel-stainer/">http://blog.lesterpickerphoto.com/2011/04/25/through-the-eyes-of-daniel-stainer/</a>).</p>

<p>What makes this trip different for me, aside from the location, is that I will be carrying only my new Hasselblad equipment with me. For the first time since 1969 I am using a second camera system. By no means am I giving up my trusty Nikons. That camera system is still a dream with all its advanced technologies and capabilities and it still rules for wildlife imagery and most landscapes.</p>

<p>It’s just that nowadays my clients are requesting larger images for display purposes, which necessitates a much larger sensor and higher pixel count. I tried experimenting with large format film cameras earlier in the year, but my 4x5 Arca Swiss camera, lenses, film and extras were just too heavy and bulky to shlep around comfortably. I stepped up to Hassy just a month ago and so far am most pleased with the results, which I hope to share with you over the next few weeks. Here is one of my first images with the Hassy, taken at a local stream. I used my H4D-50 with a 120mm lens, ISO 50, f32, 2.5 seconds, -0.3 exposure compensation. This is the RAW file, processed as a jpeg for posting here, so it will lose lots of tonality in translation.</p>

<p><a href="http://blog.lesterpickerphoto.com/wp-content/uploads/2011/11/Job_0133.jpg"><img class="size-full wp-image-1749 " title="Job_0133" src="http://blog.lesterpickerphoto.com/wp-content/uploads/2011/11/Job_0133.jpg" alt="" width="614" height="461"></a></p>

<p>As always I’ll blog from on site and you can follow my trails in real time through my SPOT GPS transmitter. Just go to this URL:</p>

<p>I’ll start going live on Sunday, November 6 when we begin hiking to our photo locations.</p>

<p>Hope you are all enjoying the last bits of Fall. It was a pretty disappointing color show here in the mid-Atlantic, at least compared to other years. Now it’s time to ready equipment and clothing for the winter shooting season.</p>

		  <div class="entry-content"><p>Tomorrow Bob (my assistant) and I are off to NYC for PhotoPlus, a 2-day photography convention. The Jacob Javits Conference Center will feature camera and equipment exhibitors from around the world.</p>

<p><a href="http://blog.lesterpickerphoto.com/wp-content/uploads/2011/10/logo.jpg"><img class="alignnone size-medium wp-image-1741" title="logo" src="http://blog.lesterpickerphoto.com/wp-content/uploads/2011/10/logo-300x75.jpg" alt="" width="300" height="75"></a></p>

<p>Our main purpose for going is to spend time interacting with the Hasselblad people, since I&#8217;m still on the learning curve with my new H4D-50 camera and lenses. I have so far found the technicians and the sales people to be incredibly helpful and highly knowledgeable. I&#8217;m looking forward to some workshops and discussions with staff and hope to learn a few tips and techniques myself. I&#8217;ll also soon be highlighting some images I have taken with my new Hassy. All I can say is that I&#8217;m loving its capabilities and results.</p>

<p>I&#8217;ll also be visiting my old workhorse, Nikon. I&#8217;ve used Nikon equipment exclusively since 1969, when I bought my first Nikon F while I was a cub newspaper reporter/photographer/coffee boy. I&#8217;m now a proud member of Nikon Photographic Services, which qualifies me for a free sensor cleaning at tomorrow&#8217;s show (whoopee!). I&#8217;m also eager to see what Nikon has in store for us professionals in the coming year, but I suspect that, as always, they will be mum on that issue. A high end Nikon to replace the industry-leading D3x is long overdue and the subject of daily rumors regarding its replacement. I&#8217;m eager to get that new little toy before my trip to Africa in January.</p>

<p>We&#8217;ll also visit some of the accessory suppliers that we use that will be exhibiting at the show, as well as sitting in on workshops where we&#8217;ll hopefully get some ideas to enhance our business.</p>

<p>I&#8217;ll report anything interesting I find at the PhotoPlus convention, so stay tuned.</p>

		  <div class="entry-content"><p>It’s been a week since I’ve posted a blog, but what an event-filled week it’s been!  So, here’s my excuse. I spent part of the week in the hospital, admitted through the Emergency Room. I’ll explain, embarrassing though it may be.</p>

<p>Those of you who read my blog know that recently, in a moment of pure madness, I splurged on a new camera system, the incredible Hasselblad H4D-50 with a series of lenses. My clients are demanding larger and larger prints and at times my Nikon 12 mega-pixel D700 just doesn’t cut it. I love my Nikon equipment, especially for wildlife action, but my landscape work seems to be trending toward the larger 50 mega-pixel Hasselblad size.</p>

<p>Over the past two weeks since I got the camera system I have been trying to learn its intricacies prior to my traveling to Zion National Park in November, where I intend to get it to earn back some of its absurd cost. Therein lies the rub… or catch, as you’ll see.</p>

<p>As I was fiddling with the Hassy grip, which doubles as the battery, at one point I got my thumb wedged in the space between the grip and the body. For a moment I couldn’t release it. It hurt for a few seconds, but I thought nothing of it.</p>

<p><a href="http://blog.lesterpickerphoto.com/wp-content/uploads/2011/10/LAP4066.jpg"><img class="size-medium wp-image-1737" title="_LAP4066" src="http://blog.lesterpickerphoto.com/wp-content/uploads/2011/10/LAP4066-199x300.jpg" alt="" width="199" height="300"></a></p>

<p>The next day, my assistant, Bob, and I drove to the Hasselblad repair facility in northern New Jersey to get a quirky lens checked out. All of a sudden, my thumb swelled up and turned a very ugly shade of black-and-blue. Since I once had a blood clot in my leg following surgery, I called my vascular surgeon, who suggested I get my butt to a hospital right away.</p>

<p>Of course given my history of a prior clot, the admitting Resident figured it had to be a clot. In any event, he wasn’t buying my story about the camera wedgie. So, I was admitted to the absolutely wonderful Robert Wood Johnson University Hospital where, for the next 24 hours I was pricked, prodded, stuck, taped, tested, retested and asked the same questions over and over by a truly terrific, friendly staff.</p>

<p>Finally, late in the afternoon the head vascular surgeon came into my room, took one look at my thumb and told me to get the hell out of there! Whew! What a relief.</p>

<p>So, who ever said that photography wasn’t a contact sport?</p>

		  <div class="entry-content"><p>Let&#8217;s face it, we all get a lot of junk in our email box every day. Ninety percent I delete without ever opening them. I especially hate it when someone sends me time-wasting videos. Eight minutes into some stupid video I still don&#8217;t know what the point of the damned thing is.</p>

<p>That&#8217;s why I was dubious when I received a video from one of my colleagues with a note urging me to watch it. But I trust this guy, so I clicked on the link. I was immediately enthralled. That&#8217;s why I urge you to do the same. Spend 3 minutes and 30 seconds for a real treat.</p>

<p><a href="http://blog.lesterpickerphoto.com/wp-content/uploads/2011/10/200885447_1001.jpg"><img class="size-full wp-image-1733" title="200885447_100" src="http://blog.lesterpickerphoto.com/wp-content/uploads/2011/10/200885447_1001.jpg" alt="" width="100" height="75"></a></p>

<p>Without giving this away, what you will be watching is a video of a string of time lapse images of various iconic landscapes, some spanning the night, others the daylight. What first caught my eye were the images themselves, all of them expertly captured. Halfway into the video, though, I  began to appreciate the absolutely Herculean task the photographer, Dustin Farrell, had accomplished. There have got to be at least 10,000 images that comprise this video!</p>

<p>After you watch it, take a moment to read his brief description of how he managed to capture them. Incredible!</p>

<p>Enjoy!</p>

		  <div class="entry-content"><p>After a year of researching, testing, talking to colleagues and trying out various cameras, I finally made the plunge. Just last week I purchased a digital medium format system, after researching both the brand new Pentax 645D and the relatively new Hasselblad H4D system. The hammer came down on the Hasselblad (oh, God, please not literally!!).</p>

<p><a href="http://blog.lesterpickerphoto.com/wp-content/uploads/2011/10/LAP39131.jpg"><img class="size-medium wp-image-1707 " title="_LAP3913" src="http://blog.lesterpickerphoto.com/wp-content/uploads/2011/10/LAP39131-300x199.jpg" alt="" width="300" height="199"></a></p>

<p>If you’re a regular reader of my blog you know that I tried a large format (LF) system for nearly a year. I finally decided it was too cumbersome for my needs, of which mobility is paramount. I am fortunate to get to travel to iconic locations, but that often involves strenuous hiking or situations where I have to limit my luggage. My wonderful Arca Swiss LF system with many lenses is now up for sale (interested?).</p>

<p>So, after going back to the drawing board, I realized that a medium format (MF) system was my next option. My present Nikon cameras shoot at 12 megapixels to as high as 25. My Hasselblad H4D-50 creates digital files that are 50MP! My clients are increasingly requesting very large images to hang on the walls of hospitals, offices and private homes and these large MF files will allow us to create very large prints, indeed.</p>

<p><a href="http://blog.lesterpickerphoto.com/wp-content/uploads/2011/10/LAP39181.jpg"><img class="size-medium wp-image-1708" title="_LAP3918" src="http://blog.lesterpickerphoto.com/wp-content/uploads/2011/10/LAP39181-199x300.jpg" alt="" width="199" height="300"></a></p>

<p>So far I’ve had the camera and lenses for only a few days, but from what I see so far, I’m thrilled. You may also know that I’m still recovering from hand surgery, so my assistant, Bob, has had to hoist the hefty Hasselblad onto the tripod for me so I can start getting used to it. I’m looking forward to exploring its capabilities.</p>

<p>Over the next few weeks I’ll be reporting on my experience with the Hasselblad. So, if you’re interested in this aspect of photography, stay tuned. In the meantime, happy shooting!</p>

		  <div class="entry-content"><p>I was in the midst of writing a blog when I learned of the death of Steve Jobs just a few minutes ago. I am truly saddened by the loss of this icon of our generation.</p>

<p><a href="http://blog.lesterpickerphoto.com/wp-content/uploads/2011/10/images.jpeg"><img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-1711" title="images" src="http://blog.lesterpickerphoto.com/wp-content/uploads/2011/10/images.jpeg" alt="" width="194" height="259"></a></p>

<p>As a disclaimer, our business is a wholly Apple technology enterprise. We have Apple desktop computers, laptops, iPods, iPads and soon to be the newest iPhone 4S. My incredibly talented associate, Bob, is nothing short of an Apple expert and I know he will particularly mourn the passing of this man.</p>

<p>Steve Jobs was a visionary responsible for creating a business from scratch that employed tens of thousands of people. His techno products fueled an entire industry of businesses that sold his wares so that, by extension, he indirectly created tens of thousands of additional jobs and new wealth. Above all, his inventions were fun to use and made us more productive.</p>

<p>But, what I think distinguished Jobs was his vision of what technology could be. His products were elegant. They worked. His meticulous attention to detail gave us time savers like the iPod Touch, a device I simply could not be without. Now with the advent of the new iPhone 4S, we are standing on the doorstep of StarTrek’s communicator and HAL 9000 rolled into one.</p>

<p>I hope that others will take up Jobs’ mantle and continue his legacy. I, for one, am depending on it. In any case, we’ll miss you, Steve.</p>

		  <div class="entry-content"><p>I’ve been photographing for several decades now, and to this day I am mystified by the lengths some people will go to get a photo. Oh, I’m not talking about the well-trained pro who carefully weighs the risks and operates on the edge to bring home the goods (more on that later). No, I’m talking about regular people who take insane risks in the name of a photograph.</p>

<p>For one thing, I’m thinking about that moron at the Grand Canyon who leaped across a chasm- <strong>in flip-flops!-</strong> onto a tiny ledge- <strong>carrying his equipment!!-</strong> to take a stupid picture. If you haven’t seen it yet, here it is: <a href="http://www.snopes.com/photos/natural/canyonleap.asp">http://www.snopes.com/photos/natural/canyonleap.asp</a></p>

<p>I know full well the arguments about whether or not there is a ledge just out of view of the camera, but even if there is, it’s about 15 feet lower. I have been to the Grand Canyon many times and know that ledge well. Assuming it is ‘only’ 15 feet below, it is very, very narrow and to slip from that ledge would mean a 2,500-foot fall. My point here is that attempting that crazy maneuver is a very, very dumb thing to do. A man died in 2007 from attempting a similar stupid photography maneuver at the Canyon. Photo injuries happen there every year.</p>

<p><a href="http://blog.lesterpickerphoto.com/wp-content/uploads/2011/10/image309.jpg"><img class="size-full wp-image-1691" title="image309" src="http://blog.lesterpickerphoto.com/wp-content/uploads/2011/10/image309.jpg" alt="" width="683" height="1024"></a></p>

<p>I’m prompted to write this by my visit to Haines, Alaska last month. Hundreds of tourists were there to photograph bears feasting on the annual salmon run. You would not believe the chances some people took, allowing bears to virtually come right up to them. These were ordinary people with no bear spray or other protection. Obviously they also had no education about bears (or higher mental functions for that matter). Ninety-nine people will get away with bad behavior regarding animals and then the 100<sup>th</sup> will get mauled and then people are shocked. Shocked? The animal is doing what comes naturally. If you are in its path, or waving a camera in its face, or running from it at the last moment, then what on earth do you expect?</p>

<p><a href="http://blog.lesterpickerphoto.com/wp-content/uploads/2011/10/LAP1975.jpg"><img class="size-medium wp-image-1692" title="_LAP1975" src="http://blog.lesterpickerphoto.com/wp-content/uploads/2011/10/LAP1975-200x300.jpg" alt="" width="200" height="300"></a></p>

<p>People also need to realize that taking chances with animals endangers the rest of us photographers, as well as the bears themselves. Shortly after my visit, a woman was, in fact, mauled there, according to local reports. BTW, do you know what happened to that sow after she mauled that tourist? Her cubs were deemed old enough and she was euthanized. Getting too close to wildlife, feeding them, helping them lose their healthy fear of humans is bad for all involved.</p>

<p>What I’d like to emphasize here is responsible photography. Responsible photography respects the animals we photograph. It forces us to read about them, search the Internet about their behaviors, ask experts, hire a guide, as we steadily gain experience.</p>

<p><a href="http://blog.lesterpickerphoto.com/wp-content/uploads/2011/10/LAP_4997.jpg"><img class="aligncenter size-medium wp-image-1693" title="LAP_4997" src="http://blog.lesterpickerphoto.com/wp-content/uploads/2011/10/LAP_4997-300x199.jpg" alt="" width="300" height="199"></a></p>

<p>Responsible photography also means safe photography. It requires that we take every safety precaution possible, including avoiding direct contact with animals. It means wearing clothing that protects against falls, stings, poisonous plants and the sun. It means wearing appropriate footwear at all times. It means understanding the terrain, the weather and the environmental conditions and then outfitting yourself to manage those conditions.</p>

<p>Due to the Internet, people are more exposed to places that before were left (and I believe best left) to professionals. That has brought tourists far beyond their experience level. In most cases there’s nothing wrong with that, but then it’s incumbent on the person to know his or her limits and act responsibly. Nowhere is that truer than photography, where we tend to be very focused (no pun intended) on the image and may not pay attention to safety issues around us. Last year, for example, a man died from a fall in the Grand Canyon while backing up to take a shot.</p>

<p>I’m not saying everyone should do this, but here is what I did before my Yukon trip. Although I’ve been to the Yukon six times, I still did my research. I also scoured the Internet for Yukon information. I downloaded sunrise and sunset times and topographical information at every site I planned to visit. I called friends to ask about bear sightings. I took along a local expert photographer with years of bear photographing experience. I brought along appropriate clothes, bear spray, and a good first aid kit… the list goes on. I wanted to be confident enough to be able to concentrate on my photography.</p>

<p>So, please, be careful when you are out there. Have fun, but first and foremost, be safe.</p>

		  <div class="entry-content"><p>As you can see, I had a bit of surgery two days ago.</p>

<p><a href="http://blog.lesterpickerphoto.com/wp-content/uploads/2011/09/photo.jpg"><img class="aligncenter size-medium wp-image-1614" title="photo" src="http://blog.lesterpickerphoto.com/wp-content/uploads/2011/09/photo-300x225.jpg" alt="" width="300" height="225"></a></p>

<p>This is the second time I had to undergo this repair of the arthritic base of my left thumb. The first time, about 5 years ago, the repair did not work and it&#8217;s been getting steadily more painful as I balance my camera in my left hand. So I felt I had little choice. So I&#8217;m typing this with one finger, just to let you know that my communications this week will be a bit sparse.</p>

<p>I&#8217;ll have this cast and wrap on for 10 days, then move to a light-weight cast for another month. The first week in November I&#8217;m heading to Zion National Park with my photo buddy <a href="http://www.danielstainer.com">Daniel Stainer</a>, so it&#8217;s either got to be ready by then or else Daniel will have to put up with some good whine the whole trip. Sorry, Daniel!</p>

		  <div class="entry-content"><p>Perhaps you’ve noticed in the past several days that we have changed the look of my blog a bit. For one thing the color scheme is slightly different. But the larger change is in our logo, which is now Les Picker Fine Art Photography (a big thanks to my able assistant, Bob Boyer, who designed the new logo).</p>

<p><a href="http://blog.lesterpickerphoto.com/wp-content/uploads/2011/09/logo.png"><img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-1608" title="logo" src="http://blog.lesterpickerphoto.com/wp-content/uploads/2011/09/logo.png" alt="" width="177" height="39"></a></p>

<p>The reason for the change is far more than marketing, and its implications run deep for me (and, as you will see, will be costly, too). My clients, from individuals to hospitals and offices, are using my images as wall art. At the same time, our very discriminating clients are looking for large images that make a statement. They choose my work for many reasons, some of which I’ll probably never know. But many tell me it is for the serenity they get from my naturescapes, the dynamic visual statement they make, or perhaps just the splashes of color or the emotional depth of a classic black and white print.</p>

<p>The decision to change our logo to be in sync with our evolving business was not made casually. We debated this for months. In the end, we decided to also pony up to the bar and upgrade our equipment to meet these marketplace demands.</p>

<p>Earlier this year I attempted to get into large format view camera photography since the huge film sheets allow for big enlargements. After eight months of effort, I decided to abandon large format because it did not suit my work style, which involves lots of fieldwork, flying and hiking to remote places; a shame really, because I love large format film images.</p>

<p>Now I’m actively researching and trying out various medium format (MF) camera system alternatives. This should give me a large enough digital image and pixel count to create very large prints that will meet my exacting demands. I’m currently focusing (excuse the pun) on the new Hasselblad H4D line (between 30 and 200 megapixels!) and the brand-spanking new Pentax 645D (weighing in at a respectable 40 MP). Compare that with 12 MP or 24MP for the best Nikon cameras currently on the market. Unfortunately, these medium format cameras also cost a bundle.</p>

<p><a href="http://blog.lesterpickerphoto.com/wp-content/uploads/2011/09/images.jpeg"><img class="size-full wp-image-1609" title="images" src="http://blog.lesterpickerphoto.com/wp-content/uploads/2011/09/images.jpeg" alt="" width="267" height="189"></a></p>

<p><a href="http://blog.lesterpickerphoto.com/wp-content/uploads/2011/09/images-1.jpeg"><img class="size-full wp-image-1610" title="images-1" src="http://blog.lesterpickerphoto.com/wp-content/uploads/2011/09/images-1.jpeg" alt="" width="271" height="186"></a></p>

<p>Don’t get me wrong. I love my Nikon equipment and will continue to rely on it for wildlife imagery and some landscapes. But the MF sensors are considerably larger and will offer me several advantages which I’ll get into in depth in future blogs.</p>

<p>I’m having some hand surgery this week for a bad thumb joint. But as soon as that heals I’ll be taking out these cameras for a field test. I’ll keep you informed as I go through the selection process. Hasselblad has been kind enough to offer me a camera to test at the beginning of November. If any of you have experience with these Hasselblad or Pentax cameras, please let me know.</p>

		  <div class="entry-content"><p>I just received word about an interesting contest from my colleague, Scott Jordan, the CEO of <a href="http://www.scottevest.com">ScotteVest</a>, an outdoor clothing company based in Colorado. If you are a regular reader of my blog you know that I am the photography columnist for the ScotteVest website (you can find my columns <a href="http://www.scottevest.com/company/photography.shtml">here</a>), although I’d been using their fine clothing long before I began writing/photography for them. I find their clothing line to be perfect for photographers, with scads of pockets to store virtually every gadget we typically use. In fact, in my recent blog on my <a href="http://blog.lesterpickerphoto.com/2011/09/02/close-encounters-of-the-bear-kind/">bear encounter in the Yukon</a>, you can see that I was wearing my &#8220;uniform,&#8221; a ScotteVest Fleece 5.0 jacket.</p>

		  <div class="entry-content"><p>The time is upon us; the quintessential season when photographers of every stripe dust off their lenses, check their camera batteries and hit the road to capture those radiant fall colors.</p>

<h2>Shooting Tips</h2>


<p>Here is a small sampling of my favorite tips for capturing fall colors, borrowed from my upcoming e-Book on fall photography and condensed for this blog.</p>

<h3>Look for Yucky Days</h3>


<p>Contrary to popular opinion, you can capture some of the best fall images on overcast days, particularly after a rainy spell. You just have to leave out the gray sky and instead focus on the forest canopy itself or on a tight shot of the forest floor.</p>

<p><a href="http://blog.lesterpickerphoto.com/wp-content/uploads/2011/09/dawsoncity1-1-of-1.jpg"><img class="size-medium wp-image-1592" title="dawsoncity" src="http://blog.lesterpickerphoto.com/wp-content/uploads/2011/09/dawsoncity1-1-of-1-300x199.jpg" alt="" width="300" height="199"></a></p>

<h3>Use a Polarizing Filter</h3>


<p>Polarizing filters cut glare, haziness and accentuate colors, making them pop off the printed page (or your iPod or iPad screen).</p>

<p><a href="http://blog.lesterpickerphoto.com/wp-content/uploads/2011/09/Hillsdale-Meadows-Banff-NP.jpg"><img class="size-medium wp-image-1593" title="Hillsdale Meadows, Banff NP" src="http://blog.lesterpickerphoto.com/wp-content/uploads/2011/09/Hillsdale-Meadows-Banff-NP-300x199.jpg" alt="" width="300" height="199"></a></p>

<p style="text-align: center;"></p>




<h3>Try a Neutral Density Filter</h3>


<p>For moving water, using a neutral density filter will help immensely. ND filters, as they are called, cut the amount of light reaching the sensor <em>without</em> affecting color. That means you will have to keep the shutter open longer to let in enough light, exactly what you want to do to make that water appear “soft.” However, you’ll also have to use a tripod to make this work.</p>

<p><a href="http://blog.lesterpickerphoto.com/wp-content/uploads/2011/09/SSP-RockRunStream-Version-2.jpg"><img class="size-medium wp-image-1594" title="SSP-RockRunStream - Version 2" src="http://blog.lesterpickerphoto.com/wp-content/uploads/2011/09/SSP-RockRunStream-Version-2-199x300.jpg" alt="" width="199" height="300"></a></p>

<p style="text-align: center;"></p>




<h3>Bring Along a Tripod</h3>


<p>Using a tripod allows you to take longer exposures, which may help you with images that show moving water, assuming you want a “softer” look to the water. It will also help on overcast days, as you’ll want to keep your ISO as low as possible to minimize grain.</p>

<p><a href="http://blog.lesterpickerphoto.com/wp-content/uploads/2011/09/Maryland-Harford-county-Falling-Branch_2009-10-22_1591%C2%A9LesterPicker.jpg"><img class="size-medium wp-image-1595" title="Maryland-Harford county-Falling Branch_2009-10-22_1591©LesterPicker" src="http://blog.lesterpickerphoto.com/wp-content/uploads/2011/09/Maryland-Harford-county-Falling-Branch_2009-10-22_1591%C2%A9LesterPicker-300x199.jpg" alt="" width="300" height="199"></a></p>

<h3>Go Often and Stay Long</h3>


<p>The key to good fall images is to be there. That means repeat visits to your local park at different times of day and during varied weather conditions. Staying rooted in one spot often helps.  A couple walking down a leaf-strewn park lane makes for a dynamic photo. Deer, squirrels, fox and other critters may get used to your presence and perform for you&#8230; maybe even a bear.</p>

<h3>Double the Pleasure</h3>


<p>Fall is the perfect time to catch reflections in a pond or lake, thereby doubling the impact of the image.</p>

<h3>Be Abstract</h3>


<p>Fall colors themselves are so outrageous you can rely on them alone to carry the image.</p>

<p><a href="http://blog.lesterpickerphoto.com/wp-content/uploads/2011/09/Fall-Foliage-13-Version-2.jpg"><img class="aligncenter size-medium wp-image-1598" title="Fall Foliage 13 - Version 2" src="http://blog.lesterpickerphoto.com/wp-content/uploads/2011/09/Fall-Foliage-13-Version-2-300x195.jpg" alt="" width="300" height="195"></a></p>

<p>Even in late fall, tight images of things like frozen leaves can be compelling.</p>

<p>No matter what tips you read about, nothing beats actually getting out there and shooting. Like I said, now is the time to dust off those cameras and lenses…</p>

		  <div class="entry-content"><p>Finally, I made a decision. It wasn’t easy to do, but after investing much more money than I had originally budgeted,  and lots of time, I’ve decided to give up on 4x5 large format (LF) film photography. In fact, if you’re looking for a great deal on my equipment, all in great condition, just write me… <a href="mailto:les@lesterpickerphoto.com">les@lesterpickerphoto.com</a>.</p>

<h3>Why I Went for Large Format</h3>


<p>I told you I’d keep you posted on this as the year - and my experiment- developed. I first got into large format because my clients often request large prints. No, I’m not referring to 20 x 30 inches here. I’m talking really big, like 5 FEET by 9 FEET! No 12 megapixel or even 24 megapixel camera is going to measure up to my standards when blown up to that degree.</p>

<p>A 4 x 5 view camera offers tons more real estate on which to place an image, making enlargements a breeze. Film still has some attractive properties that digital can’t quite match. Plus, I often like to slow down my photography and will spend hours capturing one image. So it seemed like LF would be a good match for me. Besides, I had my very capable assistant, <a href="http://photo.rwboyer.com/">Bob Boyer</a>, eager to help me make the transition. Bob has a good deal of experience in LF.</p>

<h3>The Barriers</h3>


<p>But, there were barriers I had to overcome to use LF proficiently. First there were the several films, each one of which one has to be intimately familiar with to make the proper choice for the circumstance. I was juggling Velvia 50, Ektar 100, Portra 160, Portra 400… I’m sure you get the point.</p>

<p>Then there were the various camera movements to learn, which it turns out I really enjoyed. After the first trial and error results, I started to really enjoy the final products as they came back from the lab.</p>

<p>Finally there were the myriad metering issues involved. LF is not like a point-and-shoot, or even a good DSLR like my Nikon equipment, in that the camera itself does the metering, and usually quite well. With LF I had to go back to my roots and use a hand-held meter. Then I had to decide in every circumstance whether I needed to use incident or reflected light readings, depending on my subject, how the scene was lit and the effect I wanted. Once the reading was obtained, I had to translate it into the correct f-stop and shutter speed.</p>

<p>Of course, we have all become spoiled by digital with its instant results, viewable on the LCD screen in a fraction of a second. With LF film photography it’s back to waiting until the film is packaged, mailed, processed and sent back to me. I also have to keep accurate records of each shot taken, so I can compare it to the final results. With digital, all that info is automatically available in the EXIF file information.</p>

<p>However, the biggest obstacle it turned out was the extra weight and bulk of lugging around the LF equipment. There was the camera itself, a wonderful piece of machinery by Arca-Swiss. Unfortunately, a LF camera takes up lots of room. Then there were the lenses, film, film holders, film changing tent, etc. Because I also had to take my 35mm equipment with me, I felt like a mid-Eastern caravan when I left the house for a shoot.</p>

<h3>The Final Decision</h3>


<p>Still, I kept giving it my best shot, so to speak, spending weekends and evenings trying to master the art. If nothing else you LF photographers have earned my undying admiration.</p>

<p>It was when I went to the Yukon on my most recent assignment that I made my decision. First, I had to take my normal 35mm equipment with me. That gets packed into a 45-50 lb suitcase, barely under the airline weight requirement. Plus, I carry my 200-400 lens as carry-on, and I still have accessories in my checked luggage!</p>

<p>Now, add to that a Pelican suitcase with 40 more pounds of 4x5 gear! Aside from an extra $50 in baggage fees each way, I had to lug that around the airport and into rental cars. I was still willing to make that sacrifice, but then this happened…</p>

<p>I was setting up on my LF equipment on a ridge at the Yukon border with North West Territory, overlooking a scenic valley and the ribbon of Dempster Highway below me. Big vista, a perfect opportunity for LF. It was cold, the winds were blowing, and so I had to move fast to get everything in before conditions shifted, which they do with alarming frequency above the Arctic Circle.</p>

<p><a href="http://blog.lesterpickerphoto.com/wp-content/uploads/2011/09/LAP2912.jpg"><img class="size-medium wp-image-1587" title="_LAP2912" src="http://blog.lesterpickerphoto.com/wp-content/uploads/2011/09/LAP2912-200x300.jpg" alt="" width="200" height="300"></a></p>

<p>So, set up camera on tripod, level it, open lens so I can compose and focus, duck my head under the focusing cloth, tilt, shift, swing, focus, tilt, focus again, fine tune, focus again, check with the magnifying loupe against the screen, focus more, take a meter reading, double check it, close the lens, cock the shutter, put in the film, take out the slider, press shutter release, put slider back in, take out film holder. Whew! One image taken. Oh, crap, that cloud covered the sun!</p>

<p><a href="http://blog.lesterpickerphoto.com/wp-content/uploads/2011/09/LAP2919.jpg"><img class="size-medium wp-image-1588" title="_LAP2919" src="http://blog.lesterpickerphoto.com/wp-content/uploads/2011/09/LAP2919-300x199.jpg" alt="" width="300" height="199"></a></p>

<h3>Looking Forward</h3>


<p>Now I’m back where I started, a bit wiser, but no further along in terms of gaining pixels. Now I have to sell my LF equipment. I’m already exploring some medium format options, which I now realize is probably a reasonable compromise. Instead of 12-25 megapixels, I’ll be able to get 40-80. I’m looking at the Hasselblad H4D-40 and the new Pentax 645D. Your opinion? As always, I’ll keep you informed.</p>

		  <div class="entry-content"><p>Today my 5th visit to the Yukon is over. After 24 days in this majestic land, I’m heading home on Air Canada on a route that has by now become familiar to me. I’ll process some photos, write a bit, read a good novel (right now I’m reading <em>Eventide</em>, the sequel to the acclaimed <em>Plainsong</em> by Kent Haruf)), and begin thinking about my next visit.</p>

<h3>Take Our Workshop!</h3>


<p>Which brings up an interesting point. Richard Hartmier (<a href="http://www.hartmier.com">www.hartmier.com</a>)  and I are planning a photo tour of the Yukon next summer, stretching over the Labor Day weekend, when the Fall colors should be at their prime. If any of you have an interest in seeing some of the most spectacular vistas on Earth, tune in as I provide you with more details as the year progresses. The trip will be offered through <a href="http://www.Nikonians.org">Nikonians.org</a>, the largest Nikon organization in the world, with more than 300,000 members. I am a faculty member for <a href="http://www.nikoniansacademy.com">Nikonians Academy</a>, but you can use any camera system, or even a plain point-and-shoot, to join us for eight glorious, albeit rugged, days. If you are interested, please write me and I’ll put you on a special list for periodic updates: <a href="mailto:les@lesterpickerphoto.com">les@lesterpickerphoto.com</a>.</p>

<h3>Some Impressions</h3>


<p>Getting back to my latest Yukon visit, I’ll try here to recall some of the highlights of the photography part of my visit.</p>

<p>First, there’s the infamous bear spray issue. I had two occasions to use my can of bear spray this visit, once on a too curious bear and once on… well that’s a story for another blog. All I can tell you is that bear spray works. I gave only the tiniest spritz to a large grizzly only 7 or 8 feet from me and he took one sniff and backed up.</p>

<p><a href="http://blog.lesterpickerphoto.com/wp-content/uploads/2011/09/LAP_5576.jpg"><img class="size-medium wp-image-1579" title="LAP_5576" src="http://blog.lesterpickerphoto.com/wp-content/uploads/2011/09/LAP_5576-200x300.jpg" alt="" width="200" height="300"></a></p>

<p>The next highlight is a small wildlife moment, but one that makes nature photography so interesting. We saw lots of ptarmigans on our travels up the Dempster Highway. Ptarmigans are small chicken-sized birds that are endemic to the polar regions. In the southern part of the Yukon they were their typical gray and brown colors. Once we were up near the Arctic Circle they were beginning to turn into their winter color of pure white, an amazing transformation.</p>

<p>Another thing I recall is the waiting. As photographers we tend to forget all the time it takes to land that shot. This one of a grizzly, for example, took three hours of waiting, plus another hour of photographing, plus eight hours of driving up the washboarded Dempster, plus eight more hours from Whitehorse, plus a cross-country flight from Maryland and then the return trip. Does that give you an inkling into the cost of buying a signed fine-art landscape, wildlife or nature image?</p>

<p>Then there was the day we waited 45 minutes in a cold wind for a cloud to move so the sun would light up a hill properly for the image we envisioned. And the time we waited an hour for the wind to die down so we could capture reflections in a pond. Best of all was the three-day wait in cold and rain for a few decent images of <a href="http://blog.lesterpickerphoto.com/2011/08/28/the-bear-truth-and-other-musings/">grizzlies fishing for salmon</a> in Haines, Alaska. These are just some of the waits that photographers endure. But, how could I complain about waiting in some of the most pristine environments on the planet?</p>

<p><a href="http://blog.lesterpickerphoto.com/wp-content/uploads/2011/09/LAP2336.jpg"><img class="size-medium wp-image-1580" title="_LAP2336" src="http://blog.lesterpickerphoto.com/wp-content/uploads/2011/09/LAP2336-300x200.jpg" alt="" width="300" height="200"></a></p>

<p>At one point I stood on a rise, photographing the awesome Tombstone Valley. The weather was overcast, cold and windy, but there were breaks in the clouds that gave us hope the sun would punch through and light the far mountains. They never did, but no matter. Instead the clouds moved over us, temporarily obscuring our view. We took refuge in the truck. When the clouds blew away the mountains were coated with a cap of white. What a thrill!</p>

<p><a href="http://blog.lesterpickerphoto.com/wp-content/uploads/2011/09/LAP1559-Panorama-Tombstone-1.jpg"><img class="size-medium wp-image-1581" title="_LAP1559 Panorama-Tombstone-1" src="http://blog.lesterpickerphoto.com/wp-content/uploads/2011/09/LAP1559-Panorama-Tombstone-1-300x283.jpg" alt="" width="300" height="283"></a></p>

		  <div class="entry-content"><p>Klondike Gold Rush fever spread through the world in 1898, bringing tens of thousands of dreamers, mostly Americans, into the harsh and frigid reality of the Yukon. Dawson City was its epicenter, but to get there those Klondikers had to endure a months-long journey against Mother Nature that was brutal beyond imagination. During its peak year, almost 90,000 people lived in and around Dawson City, where before there had been a tiny outpost and First Nations dwellers.</p>

<p>When the gold rush ended, gold mining by larger corporations continued until the early sixties. But what is little known by the outside world is that small claim gold mining has continually existed. It lives on in the spirit of a hardy bunch of dreamers even today.</p>

<h3>Yukon Mining Today</h3>


<p>I had a rare chance to visit the normally secretive world of the small claim gold miner, to learn about how these men and women etch out a living from the Yukon’s very soil. It’s fascinating tale for those of you interested in the nexus of history, geology and mineralogy.</p>

<p>Even today, anyone can stake a claim to mine gold in this incredibly beautiful country. The fees are modest and once registered the lone miner usually second mortgages his home or begs and borrows from friends and relatives to buy the equipment needed to extract these metals and minerals from the earth. Few miners today pan for gold, although some still do. Most miners here do what is known as placer mining, derived from the Spanish, meaning “a place where gold can be extracted from gravel.” Placer mining involves using massive amounts of high pressure water to forcibly remove equally massive amounts of soil and gravel from a hillside in order to expose and recover the gold.</p>

<h3>One Miner’s Story</h3>


<p>I visited the claim of Ralph Troberg, who has been mining his patch of ground near Bonanza Creek for the past 40 years.</p>

<p><a href="http://blog.lesterpickerphoto.com/wp-content/uploads/2011/09/LAP3233.jpg"><img class="size-medium wp-image-1567" title="_LAP3233" src="http://blog.lesterpickerphoto.com/wp-content/uploads/2011/09/LAP3233-199x300.jpg" alt="" width="199" height="300"></a></p>

<p>Ralph mined full time until 1991, when the price of gold dipped so low it was not economical to mine anymore. For 15 years he depended on his training as a heating mechanic in his own business. With the rise of gold to new historic highs in recent years, Ralph is back to full time mining, a calling that he loves dearly. Mining nowadays is often a family operation.</p>

<p>“My son would join me if he could,” Ralph told me. “But his job and family situation in Edmonton prevents him from leaving right now.” In the same way, many women were brought up in mining families and have their own claims.</p>

<p>On a typical day, Ralph will draw water from the creek along a piping system with a series of check valves.</p>

<p><a href="http://blog.lesterpickerphoto.com/wp-content/uploads/2011/09/LAP3265.jpg"><img class="size-medium wp-image-1568" title="_LAP3265" src="http://blog.lesterpickerphoto.com/wp-content/uploads/2011/09/LAP3265-199x300.jpg" alt="" width="199" height="300"></a></p>

<p>These pipes run water to what is known as a monitor, or a hose setup that blasts high speed water towards the exposed soil.</p>

<p><a href="http://blog.lesterpickerphoto.com/wp-content/uploads/2011/09/LAP3257.jpg"><img class="size-medium wp-image-1569" title="_LAP3257" src="http://blog.lesterpickerphoto.com/wp-content/uploads/2011/09/LAP3257-199x300.jpg" alt="" width="199" height="300"></a></p>

<h3>A Miner’s Workday</h3>


<p>Ralph will operate this monitor for 12-16 hours a day during the 100-day period that the Yukon does not experience winter.  The high pressure water Slams against the cliff face, exposing the permafrost to the warmer air. As the soil melts, Ralph will spray it over and over, blasting away the hillside inches a day. The shallow-rooted trees on the top of the hillside will eventually fall into the excavation site, to be bulldozed away later.</p>

<p><a href="http://blog.lesterpickerphoto.com/wp-content/uploads/2011/09/LAP3287.jpg"><img class="size-medium wp-image-1570" title="_LAP3287" src="http://blog.lesterpickerphoto.com/wp-content/uploads/2011/09/LAP3287-199x300.jpg" alt="" width="199" height="300"></a></p>

<p>The monitor is counterbalanced by a bucket of discarded mining equipment, proof that a miner can run his operation on chewing gum and rubber bands.</p>

<p><a href="http://blog.lesterpickerphoto.com/wp-content/uploads/2011/09/LAP3204.jpg"><img class="size-medium wp-image-1571" title="_LAP3204" src="http://blog.lesterpickerphoto.com/wp-content/uploads/2011/09/LAP3204-199x300.jpg" alt="" width="199" height="300"></a></p>

<p>Even though he seriously undercuts the hillside, the soil will not collapse in chunks because of its high clay content and frozen state.</p>

<p><a href="http://blog.lesterpickerphoto.com/wp-content/uploads/2011/09/LAP3296.jpg"><img class="size-medium wp-image-1574" title="_LAP3296" src="http://blog.lesterpickerphoto.com/wp-content/uploads/2011/09/LAP3296-199x300.jpg" alt="" width="199" height="300"></a></p>

<p>A gold mining operation it is a dangerous place to work. As soon as I entered his claim, Ralph warned us: “I don’t have no insurance, so if you get hurt I’ll have to bury you right here.” I think that was a joke.</p>

<p>Throughout the mining camp old discards are used in practical ways, as you can see from the used barrels being used as supports. The monitor itself dates back to the period right after World War I.</p>

<p><a href="http://blog.lesterpickerphoto.com/wp-content/uploads/2011/09/LAP3280.jpg"><img class="size-medium wp-image-1572" title="_LAP3280" src="http://blog.lesterpickerphoto.com/wp-content/uploads/2011/09/LAP3280-300x199.jpg" alt="" width="300" height="199"></a></p>

<p>The muddy water runs downhill to a series of holding ponds that allow the silt to settle out before being returned to the watershed. Environmental studies conflict on whether and how much this deteriorates water quality, but there is little dispute about its effects on the land. Since the late 1980s, miners have to implement a land reclamation process to ensure that the land is returned to prior use standards. This next image shows an unrestored mining area from the early 20th century that is nonetheless restoring itself. The piles of stone are called tailings, and they were left in giant heaps as immense  dredges scoured the creeks for gold. These tailings snake through the landscape for miles. But the dredging was necessary to remove the top-layer of soil and gravel to get to the layer where gold particles could be found.</p>

<p><a href="http://blog.lesterpickerphoto.com/wp-content/uploads/2011/09/LAP3188.jpg"><img class="size-medium wp-image-1573" title="_LAP3188" src="http://blog.lesterpickerphoto.com/wp-content/uploads/2011/09/LAP3188-199x300.jpg" alt="" width="199" height="300"></a></p>

<p>Gold, being some 19 times denser than water, will sink as the water runs downhill and Ralph later dredges it up and brings it to a sluice, where he rinses it again to remove the gold from the silt.</p>

<p>How profitable is Yukon gold mining today? No reputable miner will ever tell you. But Ralph, for example, is able to fly to Mexico for the winter and also managed to take a cruise through the Panama Canal last year, something he has wanted to do for decades.</p>

<p>So, if you’re willing to endure long hours, tedium, hard work and loneliness, come to the Yukon and stake a claim. There’s still gold in them thar hills.</p>

		  <div class="entry-content"><p>Today Richard Hartmier and I left Eagle Plains for the drive back to Dawson City. It was another long day of driving and photographing, but it seems like every turn in the road brings another spectacular vista&#8230; even the road itself.</p>

<p><a href="http://blog.lesterpickerphoto.com/wp-content/uploads/2011/09/LAP3121.jpg"><img class="aligncenter size-medium wp-image-1555" title="_LAP3121" src="http://blog.lesterpickerphoto.com/wp-content/uploads/2011/09/LAP3121-300x200.jpg" alt="" width="300" height="200"></a></p>

<p>At the northern part of our drive the Fall red colors have begun to develop.</p>

<p><a href="http://blog.lesterpickerphoto.com/wp-content/uploads/2011/09/LAP2935.jpg"><img class="aligncenter size-medium wp-image-1556" title="_LAP2935" src="http://blog.lesterpickerphoto.com/wp-content/uploads/2011/09/LAP2935-300x199.jpg" alt="" width="300" height="199"></a></p>

<p>We stopped along the Ogilvie River for what was supposed to be a quick photo session.</p>

<p><a href="http://blog.lesterpickerphoto.com/wp-content/uploads/2011/09/LAP3077.jpg"><img class="aligncenter size-medium wp-image-1557" title="_LAP3077" src="http://blog.lesterpickerphoto.com/wp-content/uploads/2011/09/LAP3077-199x300.jpg" alt="" width="199" height="300"></a></p>

<p>But one of Richard&#8217;s most trusted lenses developed a light leak, so we stayed for a while testing it to find out the cause.</p>

<p>Onward, and with the last light of day quickly disappearing behind ominous clouds, we stopped at a pond to take in the reflections in the surrounding mountains (remember to click on the images to enlarge them).</p>

<p><a href="http://blog.lesterpickerphoto.com/wp-content/uploads/2011/09/LAP3152.jpg"><img class="aligncenter size-medium wp-image-1559" title="_LAP3152" src="http://blog.lesterpickerphoto.com/wp-content/uploads/2011/09/LAP3152-300x199.jpg" alt="" width="300" height="199"></a></p>

<p>Within minutes of taking this image, the weather went south on us, as did we. We continued south to Dawson City under black clouds and rain, but we did see some gorgeous scenery and even had a chance to capture some &#8220;keepable&#8221; images.</p>

<p>Tomorrow we take off from Dawson to the Dempster to explore its lower section more. We&#8217;re hoping for great weather to make up for yesterday. Remember that you can follow us live, nearly step by step, on <a href="http://share.findmespot.com/shared/faces/viewspots.jsp?glId=0kZSlrkmUT5roDXDQ9VAGrsoTydOkgGEl">my SPOT site</a>.

		  <div class="entry-content"><p>There are good days and there are bad days. And then there are days like today.</p>

<p>The day started out poorly, as inclement weather kept us grounded until just before lunch. The skies began to clear and we sailed north along the Dempster Highway, tracking reports of grizzly bear sightings near the border with North West Territory. Along the way we stopped for some landscape images right at the Arctic Circle (click on the images to enlarge).</p>

<p><a href="http://blog.lesterpickerphoto.com/wp-content/uploads/2011/09/LAP2882.jpg"><img class="aligncenter size-medium wp-image-1544" title="_LAP2882" src="http://blog.lesterpickerphoto.com/wp-content/uploads/2011/09/LAP2882-199x300.jpg" alt="" width="199" height="300"></a></p>

<p>Proceeding north from there, we didn’t have to wait long before we sighted a gorgeous grizzly specimen. This was one well-fed brute, but his markings were also particularly beautiful, with a striking black stripe down his spine, light fur and a pronounced hump. We stopped and began to photograph him, even though he was quite a distance away. Our hope was that he would continue to graze on berries and dig up roots and work his way closer to us. It took two hours before he came close enough to us for some great images.</p>

<p><a href="http://blog.lesterpickerphoto.com/wp-content/uploads/2011/09/LAP_5673.jpg"><img class="aligncenter size-medium wp-image-1545" title="LAP_5673" src="http://blog.lesterpickerphoto.com/wp-content/uploads/2011/09/LAP_5673-300x200.jpg" alt="" width="300" height="200"></a></p>

<p>Inquisitive, at one point he warily stood up to sniff us, not more than 25 feet from us. At this point he was considerably taller than either of us.</p>

<p><a href="http://blog.lesterpickerphoto.com/wp-content/uploads/2011/09/LAP_5591.jpg"><img class="aligncenter size-medium wp-image-1546" title="LAP_5591" src="http://blog.lesterpickerphoto.com/wp-content/uploads/2011/09/LAP_5591-199x300.jpg" alt="" width="199" height="300"></a></p>

<p>Now I was getting a bit anxious. Bears usually have a goodly fear of humans, especially when they see us in advance. But this bear was getting a bit too close. I got my bear spray out of the holder, just to be on the safe side.</p>

<p>Just then a passing RV spooked him and he ran away and crossed the road about 50 yards from us. He resumed his feast, all the while ambling closer and closer to us. By now Richard Hartmier, a fellow pro photographer, and I were shooting frantically. Still he came, creeping closer, head bowed and shoulders down, as would a large feline.</p>

<p><a href="http://blog.lesterpickerphoto.com/wp-content/uploads/2011/09/LAP_5641.jpg"><img class="aligncenter size-medium wp-image-1547" title="LAP_5641" src="http://blog.lesterpickerphoto.com/wp-content/uploads/2011/09/LAP_5641-200x300.jpg" alt="" width="200" height="300"></a></p>

<p>Finally, we could wait no longer. We backed away, but he kept on advancing to within ten feet and we were forced to leave our tripods, cameras and long lenses and jump into the car.</p>

<p>My heart sank to my stomach as I watched him tip over my tripod with one little swat of his huge paws. He sniffed at it, totally ignoring us as we screamed at him. I pointed my bear spray, but did not press the trigger. After all, the damage had already been done and now he was doing what bears do and that is to explore.</p>

<p>He dragged my $10,000 rig to the side of the road and began to eat the foam on my tripod legs. I suspected my brand new Nikon lens was now a doorstop and the camera a paperweight, but he would not leave, so I gave a quick spritz of the pepper spray. He sniffed the air and when he sensed the sting in his nostrils, he left immediately.</p>

<p>In the meantime, Richard had also gotten out of the vehicle and very, very carefully took some shots of the bear near my photo rig. The bear wandered away nonchalantly.</p>

<p><a href="http://blog.lesterpickerphoto.com/wp-content/uploads/2011/09/RMH9281.jpg"><img class="size-medium wp-image-1548" title="_RMH9281" src="http://blog.lesterpickerphoto.com/wp-content/uploads/2011/09/RMH9281-300x212.jpg" alt="" width="300" height="212"></a></p>

<p>With much trepidation, I examined my gear. The lens was in perfect working order, even after having survived a 6-foot fall onto the hard-packed gravel road. My camera had a minor injury; the battery compartment door had snapped off from the impact. A little duct tape later and it worked just fine.</p>

<p><a href="http://blog.lesterpickerphoto.com/wp-content/uploads/2011/09/RMH9297.jpg"><img class="size-medium wp-image-1549 " title="_RMH9297" src="http://blog.lesterpickerphoto.com/wp-content/uploads/2011/09/RMH9297-300x200.jpg" alt="" width="300" height="200"></a></p>

<p>With that established we did what any other self-respecting photographer would do, and that was to continue to photograph this magnificent animal, which we did for another hour or so.</p>

<p>Just a couple of final remarks. First, Richard and I never felt in danger and we continuously checked with each other to be sure we were in agreement on that score. The bear did not appear to be aggressive at any point and after tracking it for three hours, we felt that we saw enough of its natural behavior to be alerted if it became aggressive. In fact, right after it chewed on my tripod, it immediately began to dig roots from the roadbed. Richard has lived in the Yukon most of his life and is experienced photographing bear. Besides, he’s slower than I, so I probably felt more secure than he did.</p>

<p>Finally, hats off to Nikon. Their pro line is durable, that’s for sure. Also, a big nod to the folks at Really Right Stuff. The tripod ball head they make is widely considered the best in the industry. It held the camera fast, which is a major reason I feel the camera and lens did not shatter. Add “bear-proof” to your list of features, guys.</p>

<p>Oh, one more thing… bear spray works!</p>

		  <div class="entry-content"><p>Well, today has been a l-o-n-g day of photography. <a href="http://www.hartmier.com">Richard Hartmier</a> and I spent the night at the Downtown Hotel in Dawson City, had a 6:00 AM breakfast and were on the road before 7 in order to get to a beaver pond by 8:30 to record their winter preparations before they went to sleep for the day.</p>

<h3>Frustrations</h3>


<p>That’s when we encountered our first frustration. The pond was lightly frozen over (remember, today is August 31!) with a few small holes indicating where the beavers had recently surfaced, but there were no signs of the beaver families. Strike one. However, we did take some landscape images at the pond, so it was not a total waste. I’ll share some of these experimental images with you in a future blog… I’ll need your feedback!</p>

<p>We continued to the Tombstone valley overlook, which I had eagerly anticipated because that would be the first time on this trip that I’d get to use my 4x5 view camera. The day was crisp and clear, the sun was shining, but there was nary a cloud in the sky and the tundra plants had not yet turned into their Fall colors due to the enormous amounts of rain in the Yukon over this summer. The vista, which is normally strikingly rich, with lots of depth, was flat and uninteresting. I never even set up my camera. Strike two.</p>

<h3>Landscapes</h3>


<p>With two strikes against us, we were eager to hit some home runs… and we did. As we drove due north, we managed some interesting landscape images.</p>

<p><a href="http://blog.lesterpickerphoto.com/wp-content/uploads/2011/09/LAP2748.jpg"><img class="size-medium wp-image-1531" title="_LAP2748" src="http://blog.lesterpickerphoto.com/wp-content/uploads/2011/09/LAP2748-300x199.jpg" alt="" width="300" height="199"></a></p>

<p>We also stopped at Two Moose Pond, not expecting to find any moose, since a few weeks ago a group of First Nations hunters had shot two moose at the pond, in front of shocked tourists.</p>

<h3>Of Moose and Bears</h3>


<p>We hung around taking some landscape images, and suddenly, there was a cow and calf in the distance, the first to repopulate the lush pond environment. Unfortunately we weren’t able to get close, but I did manage a few shots using a Nikkor 500mm lens and 1.4 teleconverter on a Nikon D300 body.</p>

<p><a href="http://blog.lesterpickerphoto.com/wp-content/uploads/2011/09/LAP_5371.jpg"><img class="size-medium wp-image-1532" title="LAP_5371" src="http://blog.lesterpickerphoto.com/wp-content/uploads/2011/09/LAP_5371-300x199.jpg" alt="" width="300" height="199"></a></p>

<p>Later we spotted a black bear with a light coat, which the locals call a cinnamon bear. We followed it for a bit, but noticed that he was stressed and wanted us gone. We quickly complied, as black bears are generally more aggressive than grizzlies.</p>

<p><a href="http://blog.lesterpickerphoto.com/wp-content/uploads/2011/09/LAP_54021.jpg"><img class="size-medium wp-image-1534" title="LAP_5402" src="http://blog.lesterpickerphoto.com/wp-content/uploads/2011/09/LAP_54021-300x200.jpg" alt="" width="300" height="200"></a></p>

<p>The temperatures reached 62F, an absolutely sweltering day in the Yukon at this time of year. We continued up the rutted, gravel-and-dirt road, stopping every so often for more images.</p>

<p><a href="http://blog.lesterpickerphoto.com/wp-content/uploads/2011/09/LAP2796.jpg"><img class="size-medium wp-image-1540" title="_LAP2796" src="http://blog.lesterpickerphoto.com/wp-content/uploads/2011/09/LAP2796-300x199.jpg" alt="" width="300" height="199"></a></p>

<p>But the time was getting away from us, so we made a pact to not stop unless both of us declared it a strikingly, amazingly, impossible-to-pass-up photo opp. Of course that occurred every kilometer or two. We had no time for lunch. Then again there is only one commercial establishment on the Dempster and we were hours away by mid afternoon.</p>

<p><a href="http://blog.lesterpickerphoto.com/wp-content/uploads/2011/09/LAP27701.jpg"><img class="size-medium wp-image-1536" title="_LAP2770" src="http://blog.lesterpickerphoto.com/wp-content/uploads/2011/09/LAP27701-300x199.jpg" alt="" width="300" height="199"></a></p>

<h3>A Weather Phenom</h3>


<p>We finally rolled into Eagle Plains, checked into the only motel/restaurant and had dinner around 5. In 30 minutes we headed north again for the Arctic Circle and the North West Territory border, we there had been numerous grizzly sightings during the day. Strike three on that score, but we did encounter one of the most unusual weather phenomenon I’ve ever seen. If any of you readers know anything about this, please add your comment to this blog. Stretched across the open tundra landscape was a wall of cloud like none other in my experience.</p>

<p><a href="http://blog.lesterpickerphoto.com/wp-content/uploads/2011/09/LAP2807.jpg"><img class="size-medium wp-image-1537" title="_LAP2807" src="http://blog.lesterpickerphoto.com/wp-content/uploads/2011/09/LAP2807-300x199.jpg" alt="" width="300" height="199"></a></p>

<p>It was a dense roll, an immense wall, almost frightening in its beauty. This band did not move, but changed shape as we watched. From below the cloud, dense fog spewed out in regular waves, carrying with it high winds.</p>

<p>Richard has experience with such things and we decided to drive into the fog. The winds buffeted our SUV and we finally made it to the North West Territory border where we could hardly see a hundred yards in front of us. The wind at this point was howling. As we turned around, we snapped a few pictures of the Welcome to the Yukon sign.</p>

<p><a href="http://blog.lesterpickerphoto.com/wp-content/uploads/2011/09/LAP2823.jpg"><img class="size-medium wp-image-1538" title="_LAP2823" src="http://blog.lesterpickerphoto.com/wp-content/uploads/2011/09/LAP2823-300x199.jpg" alt="" width="300" height="199"></a></p>

<p>Perhaps ten kilometers down the road the sun began to set and we pulled over, still in high winds, to record it. The only way to describe what we witnessed was to use the trite expression that the sky was on fire. You judge for yourself from this next image- straight out of my camera and untouched- how accurate that description was.</p>

<p><a href="http://blog.lesterpickerphoto.com/wp-content/uploads/2011/09/LAP_5430.jpg"><img class="size-medium wp-image-1539" title="LAP_5430" src="http://blog.lesterpickerphoto.com/wp-content/uploads/2011/09/LAP_5430-300x199.jpg" alt="" width="300" height="199"></a></p>

<p>This image was from just one portion of the sky. By now it was after 10:00 PM and we doubled back to the Eagle Plains Motel, rolling in around midnight, utterly exhausted, but thrilled by a full day of photographing our natural world in all its glory.</p>

		  <div class="entry-content"><p>We left <a href="http://blog.lesterpickerphoto.com/2011/02/13/whitehorse-yukon-gateway-to-the-north/">Whitehorse</a>, Yukon this morning under bright, sunny skies and were granted a glorious day driving the 8 hours to <a href="http://blog.lesterpickerphoto.com/2011/02/10/dawson-city-or-bust/">Dawson City</a>, Yukon, the Gateway to the North. Of course, we stopped several times along the way for photographs. Fall is in full swing up north.</p>

<p><a href="http://blog.lesterpickerphoto.com/wp-content/uploads/2011/08/LAP2554.jpg"><img class="size-medium wp-image-1522" title="_LAP2554" src="http://blog.lesterpickerphoto.com/wp-content/uploads/2011/08/LAP2554-199x300.jpg" alt="" width="199" height="300"></a></p>

<p>You can trace our route and stopping points on my <a href="http://share.findmespot.com/shared/faces/viewspots.jsp?glId=0kZSlrkmUT5roDXDQ9VAGrsoTydOkgGEl">SPOT interactive mapping site</a>. For those of you who are curious, here is my SPOT GPS device standing on the dashboard. It sends out a signal about every 10 minutes to a satellite which, in turn, relays it to a website you can visit. It also has an emergency SOS button that allows rescue squads to precisely locate me .</p>

<p><a href="http://blog.lesterpickerphoto.com/wp-content/uploads/2011/08/LAP2621.jpg"><img class="size-medium wp-image-1521" title="_LAP2621" src="http://blog.lesterpickerphoto.com/wp-content/uploads/2011/08/LAP2621-300x199.jpg" alt="" width="300" height="199"></a></p>

<p>Once in Whitehorse I got to meet several of Richard’s friends and colleagues, especially an incredible artist in Dawson City named Romy Jansen. For years I’ve admired her fine art of aboriginal scenes and once even offered to buy one of her paintings from a restaurant in Whitehorse. I had no idea who she was but, as it turns out, she is a good friend of <a href="http://www.hartmier.com">Richard Hartmier</a> (my photo colleague).</p>

<p>Romy runs <strong>Wild &amp; Wooly</strong>, an eclectic and classy women’s boutique in Dawson. As if those two skills weren’t enough, Romy is also a truly excellent wildlife and landscape photographer, selling her work on gift cards in her store.</p>

<p>Tonight we were hoping to get some Northern Lights to photograph, but the major prediction websites give us little (actually, zero) hope. So, instead we’ll crash early tonight and get an early start up the <a href="http://www.mopedtrip.com/dempster/index.html">Dempster Highway</a>, so we can photograph a family of beavers just after sunrise and then focus on landscape shots for the rest of the day. After a short evening nap, we plan to shoot Northern Lights at the Arctic Circle tomorrow night starting at midnight, but that depends on factors beyond our control. But how can one complain when we passed scenic after glorious scenic, like this panorama I did of Gravel Lake along the way today.</p>

<p><a href="http://blog.lesterpickerphoto.com/wp-content/uploads/2011/08/LAP2586-Panorama.jpg"><img class="size-medium wp-image-1523" title="_LAP2586 Panorama" src="http://blog.lesterpickerphoto.com/wp-content/uploads/2011/08/LAP2586-Panorama-300x90.jpg" alt="" width="300" height="90"></a></p>

<p>Over the next few days we also hope to get some images of grizzlies and caribou. Please send out good vibrations for good lights and good images… thanks.</p>

		  <div class="entry-content"><p>I’m back in <a href="http://blog.lesterpickerphoto.com/2011/02/13/whitehorse-yukon-gateway-to-the-north/">Whitehorse</a>, the capital of Yukon Territory, recharging my batteries, cleaning my equipment, doing laundry and running assorted errands before leaving for the Dempster Highway again to photograph the Fall colors and Northern Lights (hopefully). I thought it would be good to review with you the past week’s photo shoot and some things I learned from the experience.</p>

<p>For those of you following my progress on <a href="http://share.findmespot.com/shared/faces/viewspots.jsp?glId=0kZSlrkmUT5roDXDQ9VAGrsoTydOkgGEl">my interactive SPOT geo-tracking page</a>, it will be inactive for the next two days. On Tuesday, my fellow photographer, <a href="http://www.hartmier.com">Richard Hartmier</a> and I will leave for <a href="http://blog.lesterpickerphoto.com/2011/02/10/dawson-city-or-bust/">historic Dawson City</a>. Just before we go I’ll re-post the link to my SPOT site.</p>

<p>The first thing I re-learned from my week with Richard is how much fun it can be photographing with another passionate professional. Perhaps 90% of the time I prefer to photograph alone, communing with nature as much as photographing. But when I find someone who I can share my passion and dedication with, it is rewarding in itself. Richard and I banter and tease throughout our shoots, but underlying it all is a respect for each other’s body of work. In fact, one amateur photographer we met over the three days summed up our friendship after hearing us razz each other.</p>

<p>“You two are friends… aren’t you?”</p>

<p>Frankly, I struggled to get decent results with my new Nikon 200-400mm VR lens. My first day’s shots lacked crystal clarity, something that other photographers have reported. I finally took a colleague’s (Thom Hogan) recommendation and removed the protective clear glass from the front of the lens and that made a difference. That’s a risky practice with a $7,500 lens, but if I can’t get the results I need, that investment immediately becomes a doorstop.</p>

<p><a href="http://blog.lesterpickerphoto.com/wp-content/uploads/2011/08/LAP_5284.jpg"><img class="size-medium wp-image-1508" title="LAP_5284" src="http://blog.lesterpickerphoto.com/wp-content/uploads/2011/08/LAP_5284-200x300.jpg" alt="" width="200" height="300"></a></p>

<p>I also tried a Nikon 500mm, manual focus lens, but had difficulty adjusting to its quirks, after just having used my 200-400. That was entirely my fault. The lens is capable of giving tack sharp results. I told myself that I needed to practice with the controls the night before in my motel room, but I had too many other things to do and never got around to it. Bad mistake. On our final morning the bear cubs were very active, wrestling and sparring with each other. I missed the entire sequence as I battled with the settings on the lens and camera. Yes, pros do such knuckle-headed things, too. Making matters much, much worse was the fact that Richard got some great images. Ouch!</p>

<p><a href="http://blog.lesterpickerphoto.com/wp-content/uploads/2011/08/LAP_5276.jpg"><img class="size-medium wp-image-1509" title="LAP_5276" src="http://blog.lesterpickerphoto.com/wp-content/uploads/2011/08/LAP_5276-199x300.jpg" alt="" width="199" height="300"></a></p>

<p>Other musings include the fact that most of the bears in this park were tagged, a good thing for biologists studying them, but bad for wildlife photographers. We also put some of our down time to good use, photographing small waterfalls and beach scenes.</p>

<p><a href="http://blog.lesterpickerphoto.com/wp-content/uploads/2011/08/LAP2386.jpg"><img class="size-medium wp-image-1511" title="_LAP2386" src="http://blog.lesterpickerphoto.com/wp-content/uploads/2011/08/LAP2386-200x300.jpg" alt="" width="200" height="300"></a></p>

<p>People often ask me what it&#8217;s like photographing wildlife. There is always a balancing act between getting the shot and risking life and limb. Bears are unpredictable creatures that can do horrific damage with one swipe of their paws. We had watched this family for two days, so I somewhat felt I had a handle on their behavior. As soon as this shot was taken by Rick Price, a Canadian pro wedding photographer and amateur wildlife shooter, I backed off. However, please note the can of bear spray in my right hand. Even after I backed off, these cubs came on land toward me. Cubs are even more unpredictable than their mothers. When they were too close for my comfort level, I raised the can of spray at them and yelled and they turned and went back into the water. Bears and humans need to have a healthy fear and respect for each other. Thanks, Rick, for those pictures.</p>

<p><a href="http://blog.lesterpickerphoto.com/wp-content/uploads/2011/08/DSC_4958.jpg"><img class="size-medium wp-image-1510" title="DSC_4958" src="http://blog.lesterpickerphoto.com/wp-content/uploads/2011/08/DSC_4958-300x199.jpg" alt="" width="300" height="199"></a></p>

<p>But, the best thing of all is this: There is no such thing as a bad day for a nature photographer. Veteran photographer George Lepp said that and I concur. I was out there in the rain and cold, standing next to pristine glacial streams that helped carve out the majestic snow-capped mountains in the park. Perhaps I didn&#8217;t get all the images I wanted, but I felt blessed to be able to watch such magnificent animals interact with their environment as their species has done for thousands of years. It just doesn’t get much better than that.</p>

		  <div class="entry-content"><p>I’m in Haines, Alaska right now (August, 2011) to photograph grizzly bears feeding on salmon in the Chilkoot River, just outside town. In the three days I’ve been here, I’ve talked to a number of town folk, as well as with <a href="http://www.hartmier.com">Richard Hartmier</a>, a Yukon-based photographer who has been visiting Haines for many years now. My comments are based on those conversations as well as my own impressions and experiences.</p>

<p><a href="http://blog.lesterpickerphoto.com/wp-content/uploads/2011/08/LAP1817.jpg"><img class="size-medium wp-image-1495" title="_LAP1817" src="http://blog.lesterpickerphoto.com/wp-content/uploads/2011/08/LAP1817-300x199.jpg" alt="" width="300" height="199"></a></p>

<h3>An Overview</h3>


<p>Haines is located on the coast, just a ferry ride from Skagway. Both towns cater to cruise ship tourists, but while Skagway has blossomed economically from that trade, Haines has been left in the dust. Not that Skagway is good and Haines a bad place to visit. If you have ever been to Skagway by ship you know that to some it can look at times like a honky tonk town, full of trinket and tee shirt shops.</p>

<p>Haines only welcomes one or two ships a week and they tend to be somewhat smaller than those visiting Skagway. The town is a favorite for winter vacationers from Canada’s Yukon Territory as it is due south and its coastal location moderates its weather, a welcome relief to frozen Yukoners. During the annual salmon run the bears compete head to toe with anglers that line the banks of its rivers. In fact, the bears have learned to steal the catches from the fishermen.</p>

<p>But the town has seen better days, for sure. The local timber mill closed down years ago, jobs are scarce and times are tough as witnessed by the number of homes for sale and boarded up stores. The population in the entire borough of Haines is around 2,000 people.</p>

<h3>A Short History</h3>


<p>Haines is named after a woman who donated money to create a mission here to convert the Tlingits, the native population. The Tlingits referred to the area as “the end of the trail,” because of it being the end of their inland trading route. Once the United States bought Alaska from Russia and subsequent land disputes with Canada were settled, Haines became a major military installation that dominated the region and the economy from the turn of the century to just after WW II. The dismantling of what was known as Fort Seward was a blow to the region.</p>

<h3>Haines Today</h3>


<p>The American Bald Eagle Foundation is headquartered here and sponsors the annual eagle festival in November. During the winter months Haines has the highest concentration of bald eagles in the world and attracts lots of nature lovers. Similarly the annual salmon run attracts thousands of visitors. Haines also attracts thousands of adventurers who love outdoor pursuits including kayaking, mountain biking, fishing, canoeing, hunting, camping hiking and photography. A number of outfitters in town cater to that crowd. If you are into any of these sports, I advise you to keep away from the two terrific outfitting stores in town because you’re bound to spend more there than you anticipated.</p>

<p>Accommodations tend to be modest. There are several nice restaurants in town. My favorites were <strong>The Chilkat Bakery &amp; Restaurant </strong>for breakfast and the <strong>Mountain Market</strong>, an organic/alternative market and restaurant for lunch.</p>

<p>Dinners were a mixed bag. On the one hand we had a good dinner at <strong>Mosey’s Cantina</strong>, a Mexican restaurant. <strong>The Bamboo Room and Pioneer Bar</strong> is known for its fresh fish and chips, which were terrific, but its other dinners were mediocre at best. One “Salmon Special” was so awful I had to send it back. The wait staff, however, was exceptionally friendly and efficient.</p>

<p>The one thing that came as a surprise to me was the cost of food here. From groceries to restaurant meals, things are expensive. A fish and chips dinner, for example, is $25, without drinks. However, the portion sizes are huge and easily shared by two.</p>

<h3>Unique Venues</h3>


<p>As you might expect, Haines has some solid and some quirky cultural attractions. First the quirky: how about The Hammer Museum. No, it’s named after a person. This is a museum devoted entirely to hammers!</p>

<p><a href="http://blog.lesterpickerphoto.com/wp-content/uploads/2011/08/LAP1834.jpg"><img class="aligncenter size-medium wp-image-1497" title="_LAP1834" src="http://blog.lesterpickerphoto.com/wp-content/uploads/2011/08/LAP1834-199x300.jpg" alt="" width="199" height="300"></a></p>

<p>There is also the Sheldon Museum &amp; Cultural Center which features local history and native culture.</p>

<p><a href="http://blog.lesterpickerphoto.com/wp-content/uploads/2011/08/LAP1845.jpg"><img class="aligncenter size-medium wp-image-1498" title="_LAP1845" src="http://blog.lesterpickerphoto.com/wp-content/uploads/2011/08/LAP1845-199x300.jpg" alt="" width="199" height="300"></a></p>

<p>The American Bald Eagle Foundation maintains both a museum and rescue center where you can see live bald eagles.</p>

<p>The waterfront area is strikingly picturesque, with ocean and snow-capped mountains in every view.</p>

<p><a href="http://blog.lesterpickerphoto.com/wp-content/uploads/2011/08/LAP1864.jpg"><img class="aligncenter size-medium wp-image-1499" title="_LAP1864" src="http://blog.lesterpickerphoto.com/wp-content/uploads/2011/08/LAP1864-300x199.jpg" alt="" width="300" height="199"></a></p>

<h3>Around Haines</h3>


<p>The views and wildlife attractions around Haines are incredible. Drive a few hundred yards from town in any direction and you’ll feast on eye candy.</p>

<p><a href="http://blog.lesterpickerphoto.com/wp-content/uploads/2011/08/LAP2163.jpg"><img class="aligncenter size-medium wp-image-1500" title="_LAP2163" src="http://blog.lesterpickerphoto.com/wp-content/uploads/2011/08/LAP2163-300x199.jpg" alt="" width="300" height="199"></a></p>

<p>Bald eagles are everywhere, bears roam the roads, forest and shoreline at this time of year, and seals swim upriver to feast on the salmon. We saw black mink, many bird species, and dozens of waterfalls. The weather is chilly and often misty or rainy right now, but if you are the outdoors type, I’d easily recommend Haines as a vacation destination.</p>

		  <div class="entry-content"><p>Okay, let me get this over with before my “friend” Richard Hartmier spills the beans. I sprayed myself with bear spray today. In my defense, it was a teensy spritz and it was done protecting Richard and a tourist… well, kinda. Sorta. Well that’s almost the truth.</p>

<p>Here’s what happened. We were photographing a mother with three cubs that had climbed up the embankment of the Chilkoot River and were now on the road, heading for a group of tourists. So absorbed were we in our work, we did not realize that another bear family was coming up behind us! Some alert tourists yelled toward us and we picked up our tripods and walked behind Richard’s vehicle. We didn’t even have time to get into the vehicle. The bears passed within five feet of us, so I got my bear spray ready and popped off the safety catch, just in case. They passed us with no incident, as we watched each other warily. In my rush to re-set my tripod and photograph them approaching the original family of bears in what could have been a dramatic encounter, my elbow hit the bear spray and psssst!</p>

<p>Bear spray is not a pleasant substance. It is the highest concentration of capsacin- hot pepper spray- imaginable. Loyal readers will remember that a similar incident happened to a friend of mine last week, only his spray was in his pants pocket and inflicted far more pain and suffering. Bear spray burns your lungs and skin, but luckily it only came in slight contact with my hands and came nowhere near my eyes. My consequences involved a ruined photo vest and a late night trip to the laundromat to wash my fleece jacket. Worst of all was the incessant jokes and ribbing I was forced to endure from Richard all day and night and probably for the rest of my life. Yukoners have very little else to entertain themselves, so I don’t mind being the grownup here and humoring the poor bloke. Anyway, that’s my story and I’m sticking to it.</p>

<p><a href="http://blog.lesterpickerphoto.com/wp-content/uploads/2011/08/LAP_5025.jpg"><img class="size-medium wp-image-1478" title="LAP_5025" src="http://blog.lesterpickerphoto.com/wp-content/uploads/2011/08/LAP_5025-300x200.jpg" alt="" width="300" height="200"></a></p>

<p>Now, onto the bears. There were lots of them today and I managed to get some decent shots, although the ones I’m showing you here are quickies. Better images will be forthcoming on my <a href="http://www.lesterpickerphoto.com">gallery website</a>, so stay tuned.The best thing about today was the chance to test out some techniques with my new Nikon 200-400mm VR lens and a 500mm piece of junk that Richard is trying to pawn off on me. We had loads of fun photographing these hulking animals, as they gorged themselves on high protein, high fat salmon in preparation for winter. The cubs you see in the photos are two years old and will stay with their mother for another year or so. You can see in some photos that some of them are tagged for research purposes.</p>

<p><a href="http://blog.lesterpickerphoto.com/wp-content/uploads/2011/08/LAP_4977.jpg"><img class="size-medium wp-image-1479" title="LAP_4977" src="http://blog.lesterpickerphoto.com/wp-content/uploads/2011/08/LAP_4977-300x200.jpg" alt="" width="300" height="200"></a></p>

<p>We’ll continue photographing bears tomorrow in Haines. You can follow my tracks on an interactive map at: <a href="http://share.findmespot.com/shared/faces/viewspots.jsp?glId=0kZSlrkmUT5roDXDQ9VAGrsoTydOkgGEl">http://share.findmespot.com/shared/faces/viewspots.jsp?</a>. You&#8217;ll notice that we are spending concentrated time in one area and staying in one spot for extended periods of time.</p>

<p>Within the next two days I’ll describe this quaint seacoast town and its spectacular mountainous surroundings in some detail.</p>

<p><a href="http://blog.lesterpickerphoto.com/wp-content/uploads/2011/08/LAP_5137.jpg"><img class="size-medium wp-image-1480" title="LAP_5137" src="http://blog.lesterpickerphoto.com/wp-content/uploads/2011/08/LAP_5137-300x200.jpg" alt="" width="300" height="200"></a></p>

		  <div class="entry-content"><p>Richard Hartmier and I <a href="http://share.findmespot.com/shared/faces/viewspots.jsp?glId=0kZSlrkmUT5roDXDQ9VAGrsoTydOkgGEl">traveled from Whitehorse, Yukon Territory, Canada to Haines, Alaska</a> today, in a car ride punctuated by frequent photo stops. The landscapes were enhanced by low-lying fog, so look for future blogs showcasing some of those images or visit my <a href="http://www.lesterpickerphoto.com">gallery website</a> to see the final cuts.</p>

<p>Driving through the mountain passes, we descended toward the ocean in Haines and set our clocks back an hour. I found the ride a bit difficult due to a cracked rib injury I sustained during my drive up the Dempster Highway last week. Still, we made it to Haines in time for lunch, except we decided instead to just check out the bear situation first. Needless to say, that diversion delayed lunch for about three hours.</p>

<p>No sooner did we hit the bear viewing area that Richard has scouted than we saw a female grizzly with three cubs wading into the Chilkoot river fishing for salmon. This is prime gorging time before the bears settle into their winter sleep (technically, they do not hibernate). Unfortunately for us, but fortunately for the tourists, a large cruise ship was in port and a throng of people crowded the shore viewing the bears. There is no question in our minds that there will eventually be a bad bear-human interaction here and it won&#8217;t be the fault of the bears, who will have to then be killed. Some of the humans were taking downright stupid chances with animals that could kill or maim them in one swat of their powerful claws.</p>

<p><a href="http://blog.lesterpickerphoto.com/wp-content/uploads/2011/08/LAP_4877.jpg"><img class="size-medium wp-image-1469" title="LAP_4877" src="http://blog.lesterpickerphoto.com/wp-content/uploads/2011/08/LAP_4877-300x199.jpg" alt="" width="300" height="199"></a></p>

<p>After lunch we went back for a second shooting session, although lugging around my tripod and telephoto howitzer was painful at times. We did manage to see a second female with two cubs as they fished together on a fishing weir maintained by Native Americans. For those of you unfamiliar with the concept, a weir is a series of poles set into a river to trap fish, a definite plus for hungry bears.</p>

<p><a href="http://blog.lesterpickerphoto.com/wp-content/uploads/2011/08/LAP_4837.jpg"><img class="size-medium wp-image-1470" title="LAP_4837" src="http://blog.lesterpickerphoto.com/wp-content/uploads/2011/08/LAP_4837-300x199.jpg" alt="" width="300" height="199"></a></p>

<p>Minutes later the cubs were successful, having caught a delicious salmon snack, which they shared on the nearby river bank.</p>

<p><a href="http://blog.lesterpickerphoto.com/wp-content/uploads/2011/08/LAP_4853.jpg"><img class="size-medium wp-image-1471" title="LAP_4853" src="http://blog.lesterpickerphoto.com/wp-content/uploads/2011/08/LAP_4853-300x200.jpg" alt="" width="300" height="200"></a></p>

<p>I&#8217;m sure looking forward to tomorrow. The weather promises to be better. Today it was cloudy and drizzly, not really ideal for wildlife images. After a good night&#8217;s rest I hope my rib(s) will improve.I&#8217;ll also give you my impressions of Haines.</p>

We arrived in time for lunch in Haines Junction, Yukon and planned to scout around for some good images at the entrance to Kluane National Park, but the weather continues to be uncooperative- low light and dull clouds. We did make good use of the time, though, by visiting some of Richard&#8217;s friends who own an adventure outfitting company.</p>

<p>We did manage to find a hidden jewel of a restaurant in Haines Junction called Backerei Cafe, offering organic foods, scrumptious pastries and fresh roasted coffee and specialty teas, a bit of a surprise for such a tiny outpost. Co-owner Jonathon Petersson has put together a menu to fit all palates, from elk burgers to veggie burgers. The menu varies day-to-day. The unassuming restaurant is attached to the Alcan Motor Inn.</p>

		  <div class="entry-content"><p>Well, the first part of my Yukon adventure is over, after spending 10 days with five of my closest men friends to celebrate the 25th anniversary of our first meeting. You may have noticed that my GPS is turned off. That&#8217;s because the past 48 hours we have been in and around Whitehorse. I will turn it back on tomorrow, as you&#8217;ll see below.</p>

<h3>Highlights</h3>


<p>There were too many highlights of the RV-ing adventure for me to mention all of them. Of course there were the grizzly and caribou sightings, and the always enjoyable scenery. But the two funniest incidents that stand out for me happened to the same person, who shall remain nameless in the interest of protecting his identity and our friendship.</p>

<p>It seems like this particular man was bitten by the fishing bug while we were on our trip. One morning he awoke at 6:00 AM to fish. Sick of hearing me always remind him, he remembered to take a can of bear spray with him. The only problem was that someone else had put the safety clip on upside down. So, when this unfortunate man bent down to tie his shoes, the can released a goodly spray of bear repellent into his trousers.</p>

<p>Now, the thing about bear repellent is that it is made of the highest concentration of pepper spray imaginable, enough to stop a full-grown grizzly in its tracks. The&#8230; ummm&#8230; part of this man&#8217;s anatomy immediately adjacent to his pocket was thusly affected greatly by the pepper spray. In the pandemonium that followed, this guy dropped his trousers, bear spray and all, faster than Superman and ran full speed into the nearest stream, bears be damned. It might have taken the annual flow of the mighty Yukon River to quiet the burning and there were unconfirmed reports of massive fish kills downstream. But, all&#8217;s well that ends well, although we won&#8217;t know until he arrives home to his wife what the final outcome will be, poor guy. And, needless to say, I cannot mention in this blog what this man&#8217;s new nickname is now.</p>

<h3>Once Is Not Enough</h3>


<p><a href="http://blog.lesterpickerphoto.com/wp-content/uploads/2011/08/LAP1701.jpg"><img class="size-medium wp-image-1454" title="_LAP1701" src="http://blog.lesterpickerphoto.com/wp-content/uploads/2011/08/LAP1701-300x199.jpg" alt="" width="300" height="199"></a></p>

<p>Okay, segue now to about five days later, as we paddled down the Yukon River in our canoes. With this man and his fishing buddy in the rear canoe, we all heard a cry and a whoosh and soon they both were experiencing the famed river&#8217;s hypothermic embrace. Of course, once rescued we had to get these men to a warm, comfortable place. Funny thing about that.</p>

<p><a href="http://blog.lesterpickerphoto.com/wp-content/uploads/2011/08/LAP1731.jpg"><img class="size-medium wp-image-1455" title="_LAP1731" src="http://blog.lesterpickerphoto.com/wp-content/uploads/2011/08/LAP1731-199x300.jpg" alt="" width="199" height="300"></a></p>

<p>Memorable highlights, agreed? By time you read this my friends will all have left Yukon Territory for the Sta</p>

<h3>Lowlights</h3>


<p>Probably the lowest point in our adventure was when the water-line plumbing in one of our RVs broke, making it impossible for those three men to shower, cook, wash dishes or use the bathroom for the rest of the trip, a major inconvenience if there ever was one, since the other RV had to pick up the slack. When we got back, the RV owner agreed that it was a design flaw and that he had personally complained to the manufacturer more than once. Yet he still charged us for the repair, with no credit for the inconvenience. When I told him that we felt that was unfair, he responded a week later with a 1,205-word rant about how HE felt unfairly treated! And that was after he and his wife were paid more than $6,500! Go figure.</p>

<p>My suggestion is that you rent from one of the larger and more reputable RV places like Fraserway or Canadream or Cruise Canada. I&#8217;ll have more to say about traveling with an RV in a later blog.</p>

<h3>Projections</h3>


<p>Tomorrow I&#8217;m off with my good photo buddy, <a href="http://www.hartmier.com">Richard Hartmier</a>, as we travel to Haines, Alaska to photograph grizzlies feeding on the annual salmon run. Man, am I excited about that shoot! Then we come back to Yukon for some Northern Lights images and scenics. I&#8217;ll have my GPS on, so you can visit my site to follow my trip live right <a href="http://share.findmespot.com/shared/faces/viewspots.jsp?glId=0kZSlrkmUT5roDXDQ9VAGrsoTydOkgGEl">HERE</a>.</p>

<p>Until then, wishing you all good travels. And don&#8217;t worry, I&#8217;ll have my bear spray with me!!?</p>

		  <div class="entry-content"><p>I’ve been photographing for a bunch of years now and I’m going to share with you the most complex, difficult and contorted shooting environment in the entire universe (and perhaps some alternate ones, as well. That would be trying to do photography while traveling with friends and/or relatives.</p>

<p><a href="http://blog.lesterpickerphoto.com/wp-content/uploads/2011/08/LesterPicker_sandhillcranesYukon_landscape.jpg-1-of-1.jpg"><img class="size-medium wp-image-1448" title="LesterPicker_sandhillcranesYukon_landscape.jpg 1 of 1" src="http://blog.lesterpickerphoto.com/wp-content/uploads/2011/08/LesterPicker_sandhillcranesYukon_landscape.jpg-1-of-1-300x200.jpg" alt="" width="300" height="200"></a></p>

<p>Between the categories of Between-a-Rock-and-a-Hard-Place and I-Can’t-Win-For-Trying lies attempting to get decent photographs while with a group of friends/relatives (okay, wife to be precise). Here’s the scenario:</p>

<p>You come around a bend in your car and spy a gorgeous scenic. The clouds could not be more perfect, the sun is lighting up the far ridge, and some wild mountain goats graze contentedly in the foreground. Everyone oohs and aahs. So, you pull over and everyone gets out. You pop the trunk and take out your tripod, mount your camera on it, screw in your polarizer and get your graduated neutral density filter ready. Oh, you say to yourself as you close the trunk, and reopen it to get your cable release. As you come out from behind the car, you see everyone else in your party opening the car doors, ready to leave.  Sounding familiar?</p>

<p>Now you start to set up your shot. You can feel the daggers penetrating your back. The windows roll down.</p>

<p>“Will it take much longer, honey?”</p>

<p>“What the hell is taking so long? I just pull out my little camera here and take a quick shot. What’s all the fuss?”</p>

<p>In five minutes the horn beeps. I won’t print here what comes to your mind, but you pack up and leave. Familiar now?</p>

<p>I am writing this during a rare alone break while traveling the Yukon and North West Territories of Canada’s glorious wilderness with five of my buddies. Don’t get me wrong, I’m having a ball with these close friends of 25 years. But doing any serious photography? Fuggedaboutit!</p>

<p>I say this having won the wife-of-a-photographer contest. My wife is a saint when it comes to waiting for me to create an image. Lots of waiting. L-o-n-g waits. Waits in rain; waits in snow; waits sweating under a scalding sun. She and I have learned a few things about traveling and photographing, some of which I’d like to share with you here. Of course, I welcome how you and a spouse or friend or group of friends have solved this thorny issue.</p>

<ol>
<li>Be considerate. Civility is in short supply nowadays. So let’s all agree to be civil and courteous to one another as we work out our own way to fairly divvy up the touring and photography time slots.</li>
    <li>Get a life. While your man or woman is photographing, find something else to do that will occupy your time, preferably away from the photographer. My wife, for example, dabbles in her own photography (one of her photos was selected for a calendar). She also sketches and later turns the sketch into top-notch art.</li>
    <li>Negotiate an agreement. Let your companion(s) know about your commitment to photography in advance. Then come to an agreement as to what you would like to get out of the trip photographically, when you guarantee you will not take pictures, etc.</li>
    <li>Research in advance. Knowing what kinds of images you would like to create, and of  which iconic scenes, will go a long way to reducing your photographic anxiety. It will also help you to be prepared, so you can be efficient once on site.</li>
    <li>Celebrate the work of others. Look, your friends may not take prizewinning images, but that does not mean they won’t derive just as much enjoyment from them. Encourage their efforts, praise their work, offer tips and suggestions&#8230; if they want them.</li>
    <li>Choose diversity. Arrange to visit places that have a bevy of activities for the whole group. While you’re out photographing the others can be doing their own thing.</li>
    <li>Go alone. One thing is for sure. If you go someplace alone you will have all the time you want for photography.</li>
</ol>


<p>Other suggestions? Please leave a comment.</p>

<p>You come around a bend in your car and spy a gorgeous scenic. The clouds could not be more perfect, the sun is lighting up the far ridge, and some wild mountain goats graze contentedly in the foreground. Everyone oohs and aahs. So, you pull over and everyone gets out. You pop the trunk and take out your tripod, mount your camera on it, screw in your polarizer and get your graduated neutral density filter ready. Oh, you say to yourself as you close the trunk, and reopen it to get your cable release. As you come out from behind the car, you see everyone else in your party opening the car doors, ready to leave.  Sounding familiar?</p>

<p>Now you start to set up your shot. You can feel the daggers penetrating your back. The windows roll down.</p>

<p>“Will it take much longer, honey?”</p>

<p>“What the hell is taking so long? I just pull out my little camera here and take a quick shot. What’s all the fuss?”</p>

<p>In five minutes the horn beeps. I won’t print here what comes to your mind, but you pack up and leave. Familiar now?</p>

<p>I am writing this during a rare alone break while traveling the Yukon and North West Territories of Canada’s glorious wilderness with five of my buddies. Don’t get me wrong, I’m having a ball with these close friends of 25 years. But doing any serious photography? Fuggedaboutit!</p>

<p>I say this having won the wife-of-a-photographer contest. My wife is a saint when it comes to waiting for me to create an image. Lots of waiting. L-o-n-g waits. Waits in rain; waits in snow; waits sweating under a scalding sun. She and I have learned a few things about traveling and photographing, some of which I’d like to share with you here. Of course, I welcome how you and a spouse or friend or group of friends have solved this thorny issue.</p>

<ol>
<li>Be considerate. Civility is in short supply nowadays. So let’s all agree to be civil and courteous to one another as we work out our own way to fairly divvy up the touring and photography time slots.</li>
    <li>Get a life. While your man or woman is photographing, find something else to do that will occupy your time, preferably away from the photographer. My wife, for example, dabbles in her own photography (one of her photos was selected for a calendar). She also sketches and later turns the sketch into top-notch art.</li>
    <li>Negotiate an agreement. Let your companion(s) know about your commitment to photography in advance. Then come to an agreement as to what you would like to get out of the trip photographically, when you guarantee you will not take pictures, etc.</li>
    <li>Research in advance. Knowing what kinds of images you would like to create, and of  which iconic scenes, will go a long way to reducing your photographic anxiety. It will also help you to be prepared, so you can be efficient once on site.</li>
    <li>Celebrate the work of others. Look, your friends may not take prizewinning images, but that does not mean they won’t derive just as much enjoyment from them. Encourage their efforts, praise their work, offer tips and suggestions&#8230; if they want them.</li>
    <li>Choose diversity. Arrange to visit places that have a bevy of activities for the whole group. While you’re out photographing the others can be doing their own thing.</li>
    <li>Go alone. One thing is for sure. If you go someplace alone you will have all the time you want for photography.</li>
</ol>

		  <div class="entry-content"><p>I&#8217;m sitting in the Eagle Plains Hotel and Restaurant lobby as I create this blog. After our disappointment regarding Tuktoyaktuk, we headed back south toward Dawson City. Our group was excited to see three very large grizzlies, including one male that was about the biggest grizzly I&#8217;ve ever seen. We also saw seven caribou. All in all it was quite a trip segment.</p>

<p><a href="http://blog.lesterpickerphoto.com/wp-content/uploads/2011/08/LAP_4346.jpg"><img class="size-medium wp-image-1442" title="LAP_4346" src="http://blog.lesterpickerphoto.com/wp-content/uploads/2011/08/LAP_4346-200x300.jpg" alt="" width="200" height="300"></a></p>

<p>The skies continue to plague us, although we did get a sustained sunny period en route here.  The tundra is an incredible sight when the sun plays on the golden shrubs, grasses and lichens. The land is so vast and the gentle mountains add texture to the magical landscapes.</p>

<p>We will continue south all day tomorrow, covering perhaps 150 miles, if we are lucky and the good weather holds. Driving on the Dempster is difficult, with its many potholes and ridges and one needs to slow down whenever a vehicle approaches from the opposite direction so as to minimize rock damage to windshields. Fortunately, we pass very few vehicles. One one stretch last night we drove for 4 hours and did not pass one vehicle. We stopped at a pullout and spent the night. Sleeping was tough since it was still light outside at midnight. Such is life in the far north.</p>

<p>More to come.</p>

		  <div class="entry-content"><p>Sad to say, our flight to Tuktoyaktuk was cancelled. We waited for the skies to clear from 8:30 AM to 1:30 PM. First we were delayed by heavy fog in Inuvik. Then it was 30 mph winds and rain in Tuk. At 1:30 the Aklak Air service agent came out to tell us we were last Saturday’s dinner.</p>

<p><a href="http://blog.lesterpickerphoto.com/wp-content/uploads/2011/08/Unknown.jpeg"><img class="size-full wp-image-1439" title="Unknown" src="http://blog.lesterpickerphoto.com/wp-content/uploads/2011/08/Unknown.jpeg" alt="" width="205" height="127"></a></p>

<p>We weren’t able to reschedule due to a lack of seats on the next day’s flights so, reluctantly we left the airport knowing that our dip in the frigid waters of the Arctic Ocean will remain on my bucket list. Note I say “my” bucket list. I think my friends are somewhat relieved… okay, very relieved.</p>

<p>In an attempt to make lemonade, the cancellation will give us more time on the Dempster Highway as we drive back to Dawson City and then on to Whitehorse. On the way up here we did manage to see a juvenile grizzly walking down the road, but no caribou… yet. Hopefully the weather will be more cooperative for landscape and wildlife photography.</p>

<p>Hope you are all having a good end to summer.</p>

		  <div class="entry-content"><p>We are in the Inuvik airport now, waiting for our flight to Tuktoyaktuk, which has been delayed at least an hour due to pea-soup fog. Thankfully, the airport has free Wifi. Knowing that you have all waited your entire lives for a tour of the Inuvik airport, I thought I&#8217;d include some shots.</p>

<p><a href="http://blog.lesterpickerphoto.com/wp-content/uploads/2011/08/LAP1400.jpg"><img class="size-medium wp-image-1432" title="_LAP1400" src="http://blog.lesterpickerphoto.com/wp-content/uploads/2011/08/LAP1400-300x199.jpg" alt="" width="300" height="199"></a></p>

<p>Inside the Terminal building there is a terrific map of the Arctic. The pink is Canadian territory. We are located at the top left of the pink area.</p>

<p><a href="http://blog.lesterpickerphoto.com/wp-content/uploads/2011/08/LAP1406.jpg"><img class="size-medium wp-image-1433" title="_LAP1406" src="http://blog.lesterpickerphoto.com/wp-content/uploads/2011/08/LAP1406-300x199.jpg" alt="" width="300" height="199"></a></p>

<p>If you want a better view of where we are in relation to the North Pole, take a gander at this video I made of the map, showing the entire circumpolar region. I try to trace our route from Whitehorse, Yukon Territory, to Dawson City, then up the Dempster Highway to Inuvik, then to Tuktoyaktuk. It&#8217;s sobering to think that, as far as we&#8217;ve come, the actual North Pole is still 2,000 miles away! Scary!!</p>

<p><a href="http://youtu.be/rXjm_hE4bYg">http://youtu.be/rXjm_hE4bYg</a></p>

<p>Also in the Terminal building is this polar bear which, by the way, was NOT killed for the making of this diorama. It was found dead on the ice and put to good biological use.</p>

		  <div class="entry-content"><p>It’s been a long and grueling 450-mile drive up Canada’s Dempster Highway, battling rain, potholes and our RV sliding in the mud. But, we finally drove into the remote town of Inuvik, North West Territory this afternoon. The final segment of our drive found us on two ferries, one on the Peel River and the other over the McKenzie River, as we descended from the Yukon tundra to the ocean, a descent of about 3,300 feet.</p>

<p><a href="http://youtu.be/D-MZdRsaRs8">http://youtu.be/D-MZdRsaRs8</a></p>

<p>Once we crossed the McKenzie, we made a beeline to Inuvik, as interesting a town as anyone has ever seen. There is only one major shopping street, with a mix of hotels, gift shops, cafes and bars. Lots of bars, an unfortunate by-product of the difficult plight of the indigenous people worldwide.</p>

<p><a href="http://blog.lesterpickerphoto.com/wp-content/uploads/2011/08/LAP1374.jpg"><img class="size-medium wp-image-1422 " title="_LAP1374" src="http://blog.lesterpickerphoto.com/wp-content/uploads/2011/08/LAP1374-300x199.jpg" alt="" width="300" height="199"></a></p>

<p>Inuvik sits on the edge of a huge estuarine delta, and historically its people have survived with fishing and hunting. The climate is unforgiving. Today, on August 16, it might reach as high as 45F, not counting the wind chill factor.</p>

<p><a href="http://blog.lesterpickerphoto.com/wp-content/uploads/2011/08/LAP1383.jpg"><img class="size-medium wp-image-1429" title="_LAP1383" src="http://blog.lesterpickerphoto.com/wp-content/uploads/2011/08/LAP1383-300x199.jpg" alt="" width="300" height="199"></a></p>

<p>To cope with the low end of weather extreme, all houses are built on cement posts, so as not to melt the permafrost and cause the house to sink.</p>

<p><a href="http://blog.lesterpickerphoto.com/wp-content/uploads/2011/08/LAP1382.jpg"><img class="aligncenter size-medium wp-image-1427" title="_LAP1382" src="http://blog.lesterpickerphoto.com/wp-content/uploads/2011/08/LAP1382-199x300.jpg" alt="" width="199" height="300"></a></p>

<p>Water and waste must travel above ground for the same reasons, so the community has built what is known as the Utilidor, a network of above-ground corrugated metal conduits that are heavily insulated. All homes in the community are connected to this grid.</p>

<p><a href="http://blog.lesterpickerphoto.com/wp-content/uploads/2011/08/LAP1389.jpg"><img class="size-medium wp-image-1428" title="_LAP1389" src="http://blog.lesterpickerphoto.com/wp-content/uploads/2011/08/LAP1389-199x300.jpg" alt="" width="199" height="300"></a></p>

<p>Tomorrow we fly to Tuktoyaktuk to take a dip in the Beaufort Sea, part of the Arctic Ocean. The weather report calls for a temp of 23F, including the wind chill. The water temp is 29.4F (salt water freezes at a lower temp). Brrr!</p>

		  <div class="entry-content"><p>Yukon with friends. Can there be anything more satisfying? Well, maybe one thing; traveling in the Yukon with my wife a few years ago. Still, traveling the famed Dempster Highway with my guy friends runs a close second. We’re in the third (or is it the fourth?) day of our 11-day adventure together, the six of us celebrating 25 years of friendship with a slam-bang trip to the spectacular vistas made famous by Jack London (with credit to Sargent Preston, of course). Lots of laughing and teasing, reminisces, catching up on each others’ lives.</p>

<p>Tonight we’re camping alongside the Blackstone River, surrounded by mountains whose low-lying reddish vegetation is just beginning to show signs of approaching Fall. I looked out the window and saw that Jay caught and released the first fish of the trip. Somehow five of us managed to cook a decent meal of fish, potatoes and broccoli. We ate it together, watching the river flow swiftly by. The days are long in August in this part of the world, so we finally bed down around 11:00, with the mountains still silhouetted by the day’s retiring light. Our RVs are parked so close to the river I’m worried about them floating away if this infernal rain keeps up.</p>

<p>As it turns out we made it through the cold night still dry, but a light rain started again in early morning as we where on the road. And what a road the Dempster Highway is. Callijng it a Highway was some bureaucrat’s idea of a joke, for sure. It is a gravel road, full of constant bumps, ruts and potholes so that as you drive you feel like you are in a blender. The views are spectacular when the weather cooperates, but today we are socked in by low-lying clouds and fog. The road is muddy, so we have the added thrill of slipping and sliding in our 25-foot RV.</p>

<p>At milepost 229 (369-km), we stop for water and gas at Eagle Plains Hotel (and restaurant, gas station and small store), the only stop on the entire 450-mile highway. It’s still a long way to Inuvik, which is the end of the highway in summer. During the winter, the road continues as an ice road all the way to Tuktoyaktuk on the Beaufort Sea (part if the Arctic Ocean). Our plan is to reach Inuvik and take a puddle jumper to Tuk, as the locals call it. There- you guessed it- our troupe will take a celebratory dip into the frigid ocean! (For those of you women reading this, it’s a guy thing).</p>

<p><a href="http://blog.lesterpickerphoto.com/wp-content/uploads/2011/08/LAP13002.jpg"><img class="size-medium wp-image-1414" title="_LAP1300" src="http://blog.lesterpickerphoto.com/wp-content/uploads/2011/08/LAP13002-300x199.jpg" alt="" width="300" height="199"></a></p>

<p>Once our guy-cation is done, I’ll spend another 10 days in Yukon intensely photographing. On the agenda are grizzlies feeding on salmon, Northern lights and some pristine landscape images.</p>

<p>My next post will be in a few days, after we reach Tuk. So, please stay tuned.  In the meantime you can <a href="http://share.findmespot.com/shared/faces/viewspots.jsp?glId=0kZSlrkmUT5roDXDQ9VAGrsoTydOkgGEl">follow my progress on a live, interactive map by clicking here</a>.</p>

		  <div class="entry-content"><p>Baltimore, Maryland, USA, to Toronto, Canada to Vancouver to Whitehorse, Yukon Territory. I tired, but excited to be back here. After a short night&#8217;s sleep, I&#8217;m taking off with 5 of my long-time friends for the first leg of the Yukon journey. For ten days I&#8217;ll take my group from Whitehorse to the Arctic Ocean in 2 rented RVs. Once they head back home, I&#8217;ll go on a 2-week photography odyssey with my colleague Richard Hartmier, a professional Yukon photographer.</p>

		  <div class="entry-content"><p>Tomorrow I leave again for Canada&#8217;s Yukon Territory, my second trip up there this year. When I visited in February the temperature was minus 40F, so I&#8217;m in hopes that this trip will be a bit warmer.</p>

<p>Those of you who read my blog know that I have a love affair with the Yukon, with its abundance of wildlife, mind-blowing scenics and friendly people. With a land mass 20% larger than California&#8217;s, the Yukon has 30,000 residents, compared to California&#8217;s 33,000,000. Since 24,000 of Yukon&#8217;s residents live in the capital city of Whitehorse, that leaves 6,000 people to share the land with 30,000 bear, 60,000 moose and hundreds of thousands of caribou and elk.</p>

<p><a href="http://blog.lesterpickerphoto.com/wp-content/uploads/2011/08/northernlights1.jpg"><img src="http://blog.lesterpickerphoto.com/wp-content/uploads/2011/08/northernlights1-199x300.jpg" alt="" title="northernlights1" width="199" height="300" class="size-medium wp-image-1395"></a></p>

<p>On this trip I&#8217;ll be trying a new high-tech solution. If you want to follow my travels on a map, I will be  sending my &#8220;tracks&#8221; to a SPOT GPS device. On my first blog from the Yukon on Saturday, Aug 13, I&#8217;ll leave a direct link embedded in the blog. You simply click on that and a map will open up showing you where I am in real time. Pretty nifty, eh? Plus, on the upper right hand side of the map, you can change the view from road, to terrain to satellite, allowing you to see the contours of the land.</p>

<p>I&#8217;ll also be posting some short, 1-minute videos at various locales, including on a 3-day Grizzly bear photo shoot near the end of the month. So, stay tuned and visit here often during the trip.</p>

<p>Have a wonderful remainder of the summer.</p>

		  <div class="entry-content"><p>Allow me to digress a bit here, away from photography and into the not too distant past. I just spent the weekend with family in the Boston area and had an opportunity to visit Concord, Massachusetts, a picturesque New England town. It is here that the &#8220;shots heard &#8216;round the world&#8221; were fired and here that the great liberal thinkers of America gathered to debate the great themes and to write the works that defined the American literary scene.</p>

<h3>The Shot Heard Round the World</h3>


<p>So, moving chronologically, I visited The Manse, the home of Ralph Waldo Emerson, and at one point rented out to his friend Nathaniel Hawthorne and his new wife.</p>

<p><a href="http://blog.lesterpickerphoto.com/wp-content/uploads/2011/08/photo.jpg"><img class="size-medium wp-image-1383" title="photo" src="http://blog.lesterpickerphoto.com/wp-content/uploads/2011/08/photo-300x225.jpg" alt="" width="300" height="225"></a></p>

<p>From the upstairs bedroom, Emerson&#8217;s father and grandfather looked out their back field and saw a group of farmers on the far bank of the stream, facing off against a contingent of British Redcoats on the near side. The day was April 19, 1775. To their horror, they were witness to the first battle of the Revolutionary War, the Battle of Concord and Lexington, immortalized in Emerson&#8217;s poem, <a href="http://www.nationalcenter.org/ConcordHymn.html">Concord Hymn</a>.</p>

<p>Standing in that bedroom with my wife and granddaughter, I couldn&#8217;t get out of my mind the obvious futility of that action. Who in their right mind would have given even million-to-one odds of those brave men succeeding? Who could have even conceived of a band of simple men and their intelligentsia fellow Brits (technically they were all British citizens) sustaining a revolution that would go on to defeat the mightiest nation on Earth? I chocked up at the thought.</p>

<p>I took a few video segments this weekend with my trusty iPod Touch. Here is one showing the monument erected in 1836, for which Emerson wrote &#8220;Concord Hymn &#8221; and coined that iconic phrase. As I panned from the monument to the river beyond, I could imagine the ragtag farmers armed with their crude muskets, facing the well-trained British soldiers.</p>

<iframe width="560" height="349" src="http://www.youtube.com/embed/oadeWYHr-Fw" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen></iframe>


<p>Now look at this short clip of the monument to the British soldiers who died that day. Note toward the end, as I pan over the marker, you can see Emerson&#8217;s house (The Manse) in the background.</p>

<h3>Sleeping Hollow Cemetery</h3>


<p>Later that day we walked from Concord&#8217;s picture-perfect public square to the Sleeping Hollow Cemetery, where the American literary nobility lay buried. We visited the graves of Emerson, Louisa May Alcott, Nathanial Hawthorne and Henry Thoreau. The cemetery itself is beautiful and well maintained, with rolling hills and walking paths. But seeing the graves of these literary giants brought lumps to our throats.</p>

<p>Most humbling, to me anyway, were the testimonial notes left by other visitors. I teared up reading some of them. One young girl, still struggling with her spelling and grammar, praised Alcott for writing some of her favorite books. An older man left a touching note thanking Thoreau for launching him on a lifelong love of nature. Admittedly, that one broke the dam for me.</p>

<p>This was a family outing. I chose not to have a camera with me, just my iPod. But, I guarantee you those precious memories will stay with me as long as any photographic image.</p>

		  <div class="entry-content"><p>Histograms! Sounds like a medical procedure or, worse yet, mathematics.</p>

<p>Well, if you’re a photographer, histograms are your friends. Don’t be intimidated by them. Learn how to use a histogram and your images will dramatically improve.</p>

<h3>What Is a Histogram?</h3>


<p>In digital photography a histogram is an electronic display of all the pixels, light-to-dark, recorded on the sensor when you press the shutter release. It appears as a graph on the rear LCD screen in DSLR cameras and even on many point-and-shoots, such as the Canon G12.</p>

<p>There is really no such thing as a good or bad histogram, as I’ve read online and heard people say. A histogram simply is. And that’s why it is such a great tool. It only records the facts and presents it to you in easy-to-understand fashion. It is up to you to understand what it is telling you and then use that information to improve the image.</p>

<h3>A Balanced Example</h3>


<p>In the following image I took, you’ll notice that the distribution of the light is pretty even. Yes, there are some bright spots and deep shadows, but nothing glaringly bad about the image’s appearance. Just looking at the light in the image, it appears pretty well balanced.</p>

<p><a href="http://blog.lesterpickerphoto.com/wp-content/uploads/2011/07/CanadianRockies2009-3032009-10-05.jpg"><img class="size-medium wp-image-1338" title="CanadianRockies2009 3032009-10-05" src="http://blog.lesterpickerphoto.com/wp-content/uploads/2011/07/CanadianRockies2009-3032009-10-05-300x199.jpg" alt="" width="300" height="199"></a></p>

<p>Now look at the histogram for this image.</p>

<p><a href="http://blog.lesterpickerphoto.com/wp-content/uploads/2011/07/wedgepondhisto.jpg"><img class="size-full wp-image-1339" title="wedgepondhisto" src="http://blog.lesterpickerphoto.com/wp-content/uploads/2011/07/wedgepondhisto.jpg" alt="" width="296" height="174"></a></p>

<p>The graph represents the distribution of pixels from dark on the left side of the histogram to lighter pixels as we head to the right. You will note that none of the pixels are knocking into the “wall” at the far left or right. That indicates that the image is not overexposed or underexposed. Overexposed pixels would be stacked high up against the far right wall. That means that one could not discern any details in those highlights. They would appear white and featureless. On the other hand, underexposed pixels would crowd up against the far left wall. No details would be discernable in those black areas.</p>

<h3>Underexposed</h3>


<p>Take this next image, for example.</p>

<p><a href="http://blog.lesterpickerphoto.com/wp-content/uploads/2011/07/West-Maui-Mountains-575.jpg"><img class="size-medium wp-image-1340" title="West Maui 575" src="http://blog.lesterpickerphoto.com/wp-content/uploads/2011/07/West-Maui-Mountains-575-199x300.jpg" alt="" width="199" height="300"></a></p>

<p>You can see that the image has many dark black, featureless areas where you cannot see any details in the darkest shadows. Actually, that was intentional on my part. I wanted to silhouette that rock on the right and put the emphasis on the sunset, the water and the mid-range rocks. Note the histogram:</p>

<p><a href="http://blog.lesterpickerphoto.com/wp-content/uploads/2011/07/hawaii-histo.tiff"><img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-1341" title="hawaii-histo" src="http://blog.lesterpickerphoto.com/wp-content/uploads/2011/07/hawaii-histo.tiff" alt=""></a></p>

<p>Pixels are bumped up against the far left wall. In this case I didn’t mind at all. But, if I had wanted to get some details in the shadows on the right, I would have opened up my aperture perhaps 2/3 or one full f-stop. Alternately, I could have just left the shutter open a bit longer to allow in more light. My point here is that the histogram only gives you data. It’s up to you to make decisions based on it.</p>

<h3>Overexposed</h3>


<p>One of the most dreaded results in photography is when you have horribly overexposed areas in an image. We refer to those areas as blown-out highlights. The best way to come home with a well-balanced image is to take a test shot, look at the histogram and check to see if the graph slams into the right side of the wall. If it does, you have blown-out highlights somewhere in the image. Sometimes you will want some blown-out highlights to achieve a certain effect, but most of the time you’ll want to change the aperture or exposure to minimize those overexposed areas.</p>

<p>Look at the following image. Notice that it is waaay overexposed. No doubt about it, a very bad shot. The highlights are &#8220;blown,&#8221; meaning that you cannot discern any details in the lightest areas, even though there were some nice clouds above the mountain. The whole area is featureless.</p>

<p><a href="http://blog.lesterpickerphoto.com/wp-content/uploads/2011/07/Costa-Rica2010_2010-05-21_2257%C2%A9LesterPicker.jpg"><img class="size-medium wp-image-1343" title="Costa Rica2010_2010-05-21_2257©LesterPicker" src="http://blog.lesterpickerphoto.com/wp-content/uploads/2011/07/Costa-Rica2010_2010-05-21_2257%C2%A9LesterPicker-200x300.jpg" alt="" width="200" height="300"></a></p>

<p>Let’s look at its histogram:</p>

<p><a href="http://blog.lesterpickerphoto.com/wp-content/uploads/2011/07/costaricahisto1.jpg"><img class="size-medium wp-image-1344" title="costaricahisto" src="http://blog.lesterpickerphoto.com/wp-content/uploads/2011/07/costaricahisto1-300x174.jpg" alt="" width="300" height="174"></a></p>

<p>Ouch!! Even pros make mistakes. Here you can see that the pixels are piled up on the right wall, indicating overexposure. No choice here but to re-shoot. I’d have to close down my aperture two or three stops or increase the shutter speed a good deal to let in far less light. But in other cases I might have some blown pixels in the image and be happy with the results. Like I said, histograms just are.</p>

<p>The beauty of digital is that you can shoot again and again, look at your histogram (and the LCD preview image) and decide when you’ve nailed the shot. Combined with the image you see on your LCD screen, using your histogram can result in far better images.</p>

		  <div class="entry-content"><p>In Search Of the perfect ISO for your photographic efforts? So many amateur photographers I meet are confused about what the ISO means and how to best tune it to their imaging needs. I thought I’d give a brief primer here on the topic.</p>

<h3>Just What Is ISO?</h3>


<p>ISO is equivalent to what we called ASA during film days. ISO is a measure of how sensitive a sensor is to light. The higher the ISO, the better its ability to record light, but the ‘grainier’ the image looks. There’s always a trade-off, isn’t there? Sometimes you want that grainy effect; most of the time in landscape photography you won’t. In digital photography we refer to that grain as ‘noise.’ Noise is most prominent in the shadow areas of the image. Also, as you blow up the image beyond a print size of 8 x 10, the noise becomes more apparent.</p>

<p>Take this example here.</p>

<p><a href="http://blog.lesterpickerphoto.com/wp-content/uploads/2011/07/sandhillcranes2.jpg"><img class="aligncenter size-medium wp-image-1328" title="sandhillcranes2" src="http://blog.lesterpickerphoto.com/wp-content/uploads/2011/07/sandhillcranes2-300x201.jpg" alt="" width="300" height="201"></a></p>

<p>This image is one that many of my clients enjoy. Its overall effect is pleasing. The image, taken hand-held in the northern Yukon, is of Lesser Sandhill Cranes migrating south from their summer feeding grounds in the Arctic. I took this as the sun was barely rising. That meant that there wasn’t much light, especially near ground level. Plus the birds were moving, so I had to use a fast shutter speed. The only way I could do this was to ratchet up the ISO on my digital camera to 800, some four times the recommended (baseline) ISO of 200.</p>

<p>When you magnify the image, as I’ve done below, you can see just how much grain there is in the shadow areas of the image.</p>

<p><a href="http://blog.lesterpickerphoto.com/wp-content/uploads/2011/07/Screen-shot-2011-07-27-at-6.04.58-PM.jpg"><img class="aligncenter size-medium wp-image-1329" title="Screen shot 2011-07-27 at 6.04.58 PM" src="http://blog.lesterpickerphoto.com/wp-content/uploads/2011/07/Screen-shot-2011-07-27-at-6.04.58-PM-300x224.jpg" alt="" width="300" height="224"></a></p>

<h3>Manipulating ISO</h3>


<p>The take-away is to try to keep your ISO at 200 or below when doing landscape photography, where you want everything to be sharp with no noise. Many cameras can handle up to ISO 400 or even 800 with minimal noise, but don’t count on it. Personally, I try to keep my ISO at 100-200. However, to effectively use ISO 200 or below you will almost always have to use a tripod. The lower the ISO, the lower the light sensitivity of the sensor. In other words, all other variables being equal, as you lower the ISO you must keep open the shutter for a longer period of time to allow in enough light or else open the aperture of the lens more. To prevent hand shake during exposures a tripod and cable release are critical.</p>

<p>ISO is the third major variable available to digital photographers to manipulate the capture of light, which is what photography is all about. The triad consists of shutter speed, aperture and ISO. Change any one of these and the other two will be affected. For example, in the photo above I shot the scene at f11 (aperture) at 1/320 second (shutter speed) at ISO 800. I needed to shoot at f11 to get more birds in focus, since they were scattered across the sky. I also wanted the mountain, trees and clouds to be reasonably in focus. But, at ISO 200, I would have had to shoot at 1/80 second, far too slow to freeze the birds. Truth be known I also have arthritis in my hands and as a result I can no longer hand-hold a 70-200 lens and get a decent image at 1/80.</p>

<p>So, what does an arthritic old pro do in such circumstances? If I double the ISO to 400, I can double the shutter speed to 1/160, good but still iffy for me. So, I cranked the ISO up to 800 and then I could shoot at a safe 1/320 second. Problem solved… well almost… there’s that nasty noise to deal with. Some of that noise can be reduced by special software, which I eventually did with this photo in order to enlarge it for display. In retrospect I should have taken my tripod with me on that day. That would have allowed me to shoot at ISO 400, with far less noise.</p>

<h3>Creative Use of ISO</h3>


<p>You’ve probably already figured out that there are times you’ll want to use the noise inherent in high ISOs to good effect in an image. I remember when I started out as a cub photojournalist watching one of the veteran photographers working in the darkroom and oulling from the soup an image I’ll never forget. It was an inner city corner at night with a drug dealer leaning against a post and an obvious customer talking to him. It was shot in black and white with the old Tri-X film, which was rated at ASA 400. This photographer had boosted it to ASA 1600 and the grain in the image gave a gritty feel to the scene. Perfect for the story.</p>

<p>I did the same in this image taken in Capetown, South Africa. I came across this scene as I walked the waterfront at sunrise. There was dense fog, as there often is in Capetown. From a few hundred yards away I did not even see the ship. Suddenly, it loomed large in the fog. I set up the shot and intentionally cranked up the ISO to give the image a gritty feel.</p>

<p><a href="http://blog.lesterpickerphoto.com/wp-content/uploads/2011/07/untitled-154-of-170.jpg"><img class="aligncenter size-medium wp-image-1330" title="&lt;untitled&gt; 154 of 170" src="http://blog.lesterpickerphoto.com/wp-content/uploads/2011/07/untitled-154-of-170-200x300.jpg" alt="" width="200" height="300"></a></p>

<h3>A Final Thought</h3>


<p>One final thought on high ISO settings. Some newer cameras, like my Nikon D700, can shoot at ISO 800 with virtually no noise at all. That day in the Yukon I shot with an older Nikon camera. Improvements in sensor technology has meant great leaps in quality images. Now if I can only get back to the Yukon at the right time of year and get the sun, clouds and birds to cooperate…</p>

		  <div class="entry-content"><p>I’m all wet. I admit it. Part of my job sometimes involves getting into water up to my waist to capture a scene. But when I notice that someone with a camera is watching me, I shudder with angst that by following my example s/he might get into trouble… which prompts this blog.</p>

<p>Summertime invites water images, but taking an image while standing in water is fraught with difficulty and danger. I never, ever take such shots casually. I take prudent precautions and preparations. I always weigh the risks carefully before making a decision. Even then, I am constantly reconsidering, looking for a land-based angle, even as I’m pressing the shutter. With summer here in full force, people are more prone to try to ‘immerse’ themselves in their photography (forgive the pun… please!).</p>

<p>What I’d like to do here is give some advantages and disadvantages to shooting while in water and then offer some tips and suggestions.</p>

<h3>Advantages</h3>


<p><strong>You’re in the thick of it</strong>. Like recording a forest scene, being right in the water gives you a feel that no other vantage point can quite achieve. There is usually a sense of separation when photographing water scenes from land. The immersive experience brings your viewer right into the element.</p>

<p><a href="http://blog.lesterpickerphoto.com/wp-content/uploads/2011/07/SSP-RockRunStream.jpg"><img class="aligncenter size-medium wp-image-1321" title="SSP-RockRunStream" src="http://blog.lesterpickerphoto.com/wp-content/uploads/2011/07/SSP-RockRunStream-199x300.jpg" alt="" width="199" height="300"></a></p>

<p><strong>Unique perspectives</strong>. Often a photographer cannot quite get the right framing unless s/he steps into the water. Leaves are in the way, a branch obstructs the view, or that stream bank is too high. Getting into the water opens up new possibilities.</p>

<p><strong>Terrific foreground elements</strong>. By going into the water you can choose the scenes that give you powerful foreground elements.</p>

<p><a href="http://blog.lesterpickerphoto.com/wp-content/uploads/2011/07/Harford-County-MD-Jerusalem-Bridge-24-of-32.jpg"><img class="aligncenter size-medium wp-image-1322" title="Harford County-MD-Jerusalem Bridge 24 of 32" src="http://blog.lesterpickerphoto.com/wp-content/uploads/2011/07/Harford-County-MD-Jerusalem-Bridge-24-of-32-199x300.jpg" alt="" width="199" height="300"></a></p>

<h3>Disadvantages</h3>


<p><strong>Shooting in water can be dangerous</strong>. Think currents, waves, riptides, splashing, and slippery rocks. None of them are great for your gear or body. A few months ago my assistant, Bob, slipped on a muddy rock in a stream we were photographing and was badly hurt. I was recently bowled over by the rogue wave you see in the distance while I was in Australia taking the following image (click on image to enlarge it).  Fortunately I was able to hoist my tripod over my head and I landed on my feet on the sand. Whew! Close call.</p>

<p><a href="http://blog.lesterpickerphoto.com/wp-content/uploads/2011/07/Great-Ocean-Road-Victoria-Australia-1702010-11-11.jpg"><img class="aligncenter size-medium wp-image-1323" title="Great Ocean Road, Victoria, Australia 1702010-11-11" src="http://blog.lesterpickerphoto.com/wp-content/uploads/2011/07/Great-Ocean-Road-Victoria-Australia-1702010-11-11-300x199.jpg" alt="" width="300" height="199"></a></p>

<p><strong>Water hides a multitude of evils</strong>. Water holes can hide deep drop-offs. You’ll be wading one moment and literally with the next step find the water above your head. Not a good thing to happen when you’re holding a fortune in gear. Water can also hide creepy-crawly bad things. In North Carolina I once had a cottonmouth glide by me. My most serious bear encounter occurred when I was photographing in a shallow stream for an hour. I did not notice the bear grazing on shore just fifteen feet from me. Nor did he notice me until I stood up. Fortunately he was more interested in the berries.</p>

<p><strong>Moving water carries debris</strong>. These objects, from barrels to logs, can knock you off your feet or topple your tripod.</p>

<h3>My Tips</h3>


<p><strong>Be physically fit</strong>. That includes having good balance, even practicing balance on a ski board or one of those ball and tray devices you find in a gym. Also, cold water can be a shock to the system, so make sure you are cardiac healthy.</p>

<p><strong>Wear great shoes</strong>. Note, I do not say good shoes. If I’m going to do water shots, I wear either high quality soft-rubber bottomed, high boots (I use Muck Boots) for shallow water in creeks or else serious water shoes (hard to beat my Keen’s). If I know I’ll be in knee-deep to waist-deep water, I’ll go with my dependable, rugged Orvis waders.</p>

<p><strong>Keep your feet under you</strong>. Balance is everything in water. Currents and wave action can pull your feet from under you. Do not over-step. Take small steps, recover your balance and then take another. Feel the rocks under your feet before putting down all your weight.  I call it the water shuffle.</p>

<p><strong>Wear quick-drying clothing</strong>. When I know I’ll be shooting in water, I use quick drying fabrics, even down to my underwear (Ex Officio is great).</p>

<p><strong>Bring a change of clothes</strong>. This is a tricky one, since if you backpack to a spot you want to minimize gear. I only do this if I suspect I’ll need to dip into a stream in Fall or winter where I’m concerned about hypothermia. If I do wade into a winter stream, I almost always use my waders, which keep me warm and dry.</p>

<p><strong>Use a tripod</strong>. Mount your camera on a tripod and extend the legs far enough to be well above the water line <em>and</em> the splash zone. Use a shutter release, too. Chances are if you’re shooting in a stream the overhead canopy will cause more shade and require you to use a slower shutter speed anyway. That’s good for smoothing the flow of water, too. At times I will use my tripod legs to test water in front of me for drop-offs. Also, if you do take a spill while photographing, your camera gear will remain dry.</p>

<p><strong>Perform a bend-over test</strong>. Not to make a pun, but one of the things that gives me a sinking feeling is when I’m bent over my camera and tripod and realize that my focus loop, or my hand meter or something else that is dangling from my neck or waist is now below water. Nowadays I do a bend-over test before taking my first step into the water.</p>

<p><strong>Use waders wisely</strong>. Waders are a photographer’s best friend for water shots. I prefer chest-high waders, but some of my colleagues prefer thigh highs.  I never put on my waders until I am literally ready to step into the water. That precaution minimizes the chances of tears. I prefer a felt sole bottom so I can feel the rocks I’m stepping on, but other people prefer rubber boot bottoms. My modus operandi in winter is this: I get to the stream’s edge and get all my equipment set up on my tripod. Then I spread out a small piece of nylon tarp material. I stand on it and remove my hiking boots, keeping them dry. With my thick wool socks on, I slip into my waders. Then I reverse the procedure when I return, giving me dry feet for the rest of the day. My waders roll up into a bag that attaches to the bottom of my backpack. Also, be sure to cinch the waist belt on your chest waders before going into the water. If you accidentally trip and ship water, your waders won’t fill.</p>

<p><strong>Use chest pockets</strong>. I move all my accessories- filters, tele-extender, microfiber cloth for occasional splashes, etc- out of my pants pockets and into chest pockets. I also have a waterproof canoe bag that I attach to my vest shoulder snaps.</p>

<p><strong>Slow motion</strong>. Never move quickly while in water. Think first. Move slowly and deliberately. Think about your equipment placement.</p>

<p><strong>Avoid raging water</strong>. Swollen spring streams are no time to wade in. Flash floods can occur in seconds. Swift water plays havoc on balance and will cause camera shake even when your camera is tripod mounted.</p>

<p><strong>Beware muddy bottoms</strong>. The most difficult shooting I experience is while stuck in muddy bottoms. Mud tends to suck onto your boots, literally immobilizing you. I have had to remove my boots or waders, get my camera back to shore and return to pull out my waders. I quickly became hypothermic. Fortunately my car was close by.</p>

<p><strong>Soak in the moment</strong>. Above all else, take time to revel in the Zen of what you are doing.</p>

<p>While I’m in water I feel most immersed in my work, and I’m not being facetious. I love what I do, but when I’m in water capturing a scene I feel connected to the natural order in a very special way. I never take that blessing for granted.</p>

		  <div class="entry-content"><p>I have to run this one by you all. I recently tried to make reservations at a pricey B&amp;B in Brookline, Massachusetts. It seems like a very nice, comfortable B&amp;B, judging by their website. I’ll be visiting my stepson, daughter-in-law and newest grandson and the B&amp;B looked pretty convenient. After giving the very pleasant woman my credit card info, I was ready to hang up, when she asked if I knew their cancellation policy. Well, no, I guess I didn’t.</p>

<p><a href="http://blog.lesterpickerphoto.com/wp-content/uploads/2011/07/Dylan1.jpg"><img class="size-medium wp-image-1312" title="Dylan1" src="http://blog.lesterpickerphoto.com/wp-content/uploads/2011/07/Dylan1-199x300.jpg" alt="" width="199" height="300"></a></p>

<p>“We have a 14-day cancellation policy, for any reason,” she tells me. Silence on both ends.</p>

<p>“What, exactly, does that mean?” I finally asked.</p>

<p>“If you don’t cancel before the 14-day period, we will charge your credit card for the full amount.”</p>

<p>“You mean for both days?” I asked, incredulous. This B&amp;B does not sport Motel 6 prices, BTW.</p>

<p>“So, even if there is a medical emergency,” I continue, “I would lose all my money?”</p>

<p>“I’m sorry, but I’m afraid so.”  At which point I cancelled the transaction.</p>

<p>Now, I’d love your opinion on this. Am I being unreasonable here?  I’ve been a travel photojournalist for twenty years and I’ve never run into this before. Is this an emerging trend? Is this a put-your-customer-first policy? Please, weigh in.</p>

		  <div class="entry-content"><p>I get asked this question frequently at workshops and from you readers online. People wonder what software I regularly use and what websites I regularly visit. So, here goes.</p>

<h3>Please, No PhotoShop!</h3>


<p>I came into digital photography kicking and screaming in my fifties. I started by trying to climb the learning curve with Photoshop on my PC. Now for those of you who use Photoshop regularly and expertly, my hats are off to you. But after a few months of diligently studying and experimenting, I found I was taking way too much time off from being in the field photographing and did not enjoy the convoluted Photoshop layering process. But that’s just me. Perhaps if I were 10… make that 20… years younger.</p>

<h3>Mac Attack!</h3>


<p>I soon switched my entire system to Apple and now own a high-end Mac desktop, a 15” MacBook Pro laptop and a 13” MacBook Air for the field, along with the latest iPod Touch (can’t live without that little baby!). The switch to Apple simplified my life and not only wouldn’t I ever go back to a PC, but I wish I had made the switch years earlier (maybe then I’d be an expert on PhotoShop).</p>

<p>With the switch, I decided to try Apple’s Aperture and I’ve never looked back. Aperture, now in Version 3.1, is a high-end post-processing program by Apple which I always keep updated. Aperture, like its Adobe counterpart, Lightroom, does 80-90 percent of what I need in post-processing. What it cannot do to my satisfaction, I find I can accomplish using several very fine plug-ins that I use without ever exiting Aperture.</p>

<p><a href="http://blog.lesterpickerphoto.com/wp-content/uploads/2011/07/aperture3-165.png"><img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-1308" title="aperture3-165" src="http://blog.lesterpickerphoto.com/wp-content/uploads/2011/07/aperture3-165.png" alt="" width="165" height="120"></a></p>

<h3>Nik Software</h3>


<p>All my plug-ins, with one exception, are made by Nik Software. I use Color Efex Pro for maybe five of its effects, and even then sparingly. Silver Efex Pro comes into play for my black &amp; white conversions and Viveza for fine local adjustments. They are all 64-bit and I never have to leave Aperture (also 64-bit) to use them.</p>

<p><a href="http://blog.lesterpickerphoto.com/wp-content/uploads/2011/07/coco_linklist_banner_small.jpg"><img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-1307" title="coco_linklist_banner_small" src="http://blog.lesterpickerphoto.com/wp-content/uploads/2011/07/coco_linklist_banner_small.jpg" alt="" width="190" height="180"></a></p>

<p>I will also use Define, Nik’s de-noise program, although not very frequently since most of my images are shot at ISO 100 or 200, so I don’t have to deal much with noise.</p>

<p>I also use Nik NX2 for certain specific images, now that Bob Boyer (<a href="http://photo.rwboyer.com">http://photo.rwboyer.com) </a>convincingly demonstrated to me that Aperture does not do an accurate job of translating some green tones from in-camera to computer. The greens are too yellow, so if I have a very verdant green scene, I might use NX2 to input.</p>

<h3>PhotoMatix</h3>


<p>The exception to my Nik-only software add-ons is that I sometimes- and I mean very seldom- use PhotoMatix for HDR. When I first started using PM, I overused it, like many of my colleagues. It is a very cool technology and I found myself mesmerized by its capabilities. However, after I let some of those ‘5-star’ images sit for a while, I came back and wondered what I had been drinking when I processed them. Nowadays I dislike probably 90% of HDR images. When I use it lately, it is with a very, very light touch.</p>

<p>PM makes a plug-in for Aperture so, once again, I don’t have to leave the program to use it. I just highlight the 3 or 5 images I want to use for the HDR process, click on the PM bar and away she goes. In 30 seconds or less I have my completed image, ready for fine-tuning back in Aperture.</p>

<p>One note of caution, though. Bob Boyer and I have found a horrendous bug in the newest version of PhotoMatix (version 4). The program shows a preview that is crisp and sharp, but once it is finally rendered, it comes out fuzzy and soft. We have sent two rounds of detailed emails to them, but they do not seem to understand the issue. I guess we’ll keep trying, but if anyone else is having this issue, please let me know.</p>

<h3>Full Disclosure</h3>


<p>In the interests of fair and full disclosure, I have to say that there are times when I have to produce big prints for my clients (and I do mean b-i-g, as in 5 feet by 9 feet!). In those cases, Bob takes my files and uses Perfect Resize 7 by onOne Software. Bob is also an expert in PhotoShop and will sometimes work his magic with it when readying my images for printing. I have no idea what he does in those cases. I just approve the final product.</p>

<h3>PTGUI</h3>


<p>I’ve only recently begun to do panoramas and I have just started using PTGUI for that work. I love its ease-of-use and its clean output.</p>

<h3>Backup</h3>


<p>For backups I have an advanced system to accommodate my paranoia about losing my entire business. That’s why I keep secure backups both on- and off-site, as well as when I’m in the field. For details you can visit my previous blog on the topic (<a href="http://blog.lesterpickerphoto.com/2009/06/02/backing-up-your-digital-images/">http://blog.lesterpickerphoto.com/2009/06/02/backing-up-your-digital-images/). </a>Just read it with caution because it will cost you some bucks to replicate and it’s a pain in the rear to discipline yourself to do the monthly backup.</p>

<p>There you have it, that’s what’s in my computer. Now let’s be fair. I’ve shown you mine; you have to show us yours! Please share with readers of this blog what photo software you use and why.</p>

		  <div class="entry-content"><p>As the summer travel season heats up, there has recently been a lot of discussion on safety issues when traveling abroad. Some commentary focuses on personal (bodily) safety and other on property safety. I recently pointed my readers to an article (<a href="http://www.consumertraveler.com/columns/traveling-to-europe-this-summer-keep-your-camera-equipment-and-valuables-safe/">http://www.consumertraveler.com/columns/traveling-to-europe-this-summer-keep-your-camera-equipment-and-valuables-safe/</a>) by one of my colleagues at Nikonians.org concerning keeping your equipment safe while traveling.</p>

<p><a href="http://blog.lesterpickerphoto.com/wp-content/uploads/2011/07/Unknown.jpeg"><img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-1301" title="Unknown" src="http://blog.lesterpickerphoto.com/wp-content/uploads/2011/07/Unknown.jpeg" alt="" width="106" height="96"></a></p>

<p>As it turns out, I was asked to do a companion piece on equipment travel safety from my own personal experiences as a travel photojournalist for the blog site of Darwin Wiggett. For those of you who follow my blog, you know that I am an admirer of Darwin&#8217;s work. Darwin is a Canadian landscape photographer with a singular vision of our natural world.</p>

<p>So, if you&#8217;d like my take on how to keep your photo equipment safe while traveling, visit Darwin&#8217;s blog here: <a href="http://darwinwiggett.wordpress.com/2011/07/16/keeping-your-equipment-safe-by-les-picker/">http://darwinwiggett.wordpress.com/2011/07/16/keeping-your-equipment-safe-by-les-picker/</a></p>

<p>And, while you&#8217;re at it, grab a cup of java and spend some quality time enjoying Darwin&#8217;s art. You&#8217;ll thank me for it!</p>

<p>It’s probably the oldest truism in photography. “If I only had THAT piece of equipment- that newest pro digital camera, that newest $6,000 lens, that newest gizmo- then I could take pictures like that!” Sigh. How many times have you heard that during your lifetime? Oh, what’s that? You haven’t actually said that yourself, have you?</p>

<p>Well, if I had a dollar for every time I’ve heard that said to me, I’d be able to open my own (part-time) bar in Tahiti and not have to work at making photographs. We’ve all heard the other truism, that it is not the equipment but the photographic eye that makes the difference between an award-winning image and a humdrum one. I agree. But, there’s more.</p>

<p>Go ahead and buy that overpriced new lens or camera if you can afford it, I’ll often say. Sure, it might give you better, crisper images. Might, not will. The fact is that these new toys are not only expensive, but they’re bulky and heavy.</p>

<p><a href="http://blog.lesterpickerphoto.com/wp-content/uploads/2011/07/LAP9163.jpg"><img class="size-medium wp-image-1295" title="_LAP9163" src="http://blog.lesterpickerphoto.com/wp-content/uploads/2011/07/LAP9163-300x199.jpg" alt="" width="300" height="199"></a></p>

<p>I was reminded of this on my recent photo excursion to New Mexico, where I lugged a 4x5 film view camera, heavy tripod and my Nikon D700 35mm camera with me, plus four lenses. By now, of course, I’m used to loads like that, weighing in at anywhere from 25 to 40 pounds, depending on my assignment.</p>

<p><a href="http://blog.lesterpickerphoto.com/wp-content/uploads/2011/07/les-on-treadmill_2010-10-01_331%C2%A9LesterPicker.jpg"><img class="size-medium wp-image-1294" title="les on treadmill_2010-10-01_331©LesterPicker" src="http://blog.lesterpickerphoto.com/wp-content/uploads/2011/07/les-on-treadmill_2010-10-01_331%C2%A9LesterPicker-225x300.jpg" alt="" width="225" height="300"></a></p>

<p>And that’s the point of this blog. Watch what you wish for! If you’re generally happy with that point-and-shoot or that small DSLR with a couple of lenses, P-L-E-A-S-E consider yourself very, very fortunate. My wife, with her Canon G12 point-and-shoot, sometimes captures great images before I even set up my damned gear. Do you really want to be lugging your closet around with you, up and down trails, on ledges, near ocean surf? Master the camera you have and nail down the art of composition. Join an online forum and ask for feedback. Ask questions right here. Practice… a lot. When you have reached the limits of your camera, only then consider that latest gizmo.</p>

<p>Happy shooting!</p>

<p>For the final blog in this travel series on Albuquerque, I’ll look at some restaurants that I recently sampled, along with two hotels I experienced. A third motel I stayed in, about 45 minutes outside of ABQ, I will not mention here, even though they left me a wonderful surprise in my bed… a bedbug! Needless to say I darted out of there as quickly as I could. I did post a (negative) review of the hotel on Trip Advisor.</p>

<h2>RESTAURANTS</h2>


<p>ABQ is a great city, blessed with a wide variety of ethnic foods and a nice share of quality restaurants.</p>

<p><strong>El Pinto</strong>. El Pinto is a 1,000 seat restaurant that roasts its own chile peppers and makes its own popular brand of salsa. The menu is quite broad and the food good. El Pinto serves upscale Margaritas using artisanal tequilas. These drinks are outstanding. If you think all magaritas are the same, tell me that after you sample their wares. Try to arrive at a time when you can tour their salsa factory, which is behind the restaurant. <a href="http://www.elpinto.com">www.elpinto.com</a></p>

<p><a href="http://blog.lesterpickerphoto.com/wp-content/uploads/2011/07/LAP9912.jpg"><img class="aligncenter size-medium wp-image-1277" title="El Pinto Restaurant" src="http://blog.lesterpickerphoto.com/wp-content/uploads/2011/07/LAP9912-300x200.jpg" alt="" width="300" height="200"></a></p>

<p><strong>Scalo</strong> Northern Italian Grill. Located in the downtown area in Nob Hill section of the city this comfortable eatery won the coveted Wine Spectator Award of Excellence. Moderately priced, nice ambience and delicious food. <a href="http://www.scalonobhill.com">www.scalonobhill.com</a></p>

<p><strong>Tucanos Brazilian Grill:</strong> Skip this one, unless you like a boisterous, loud and frenetic eat-fest. Their salad bar is excellent, with fresh fruits and veggies. It would be more than enough for an entire meal. Servers circulate with skewers of meats and slice it onto your plate. The shrimp and scallop dishes disappointed, but the meat dishes brought raves from my companions. <a href="http://www.tucanos.com">www.tucanos.com</a></p>

<p><strong>Torinos @ Home</strong>. Wow! is all I can say. This restaurant would be a success in New York City or Florence. The owners are an Italian woman and French chef husband. Daniela, the co-owner, is the most passionate hostess one can imagine. Torinos uses only fresh ingredients, locally grown. <a href="http://torinosfoods.com">http://torinosfoods.com</a></p>

<p><strong>St. Clair Winery &amp; Bistro</strong>: a classy, upscale dining experience that celebrates New Mexico’s emerging and fine wines. The winery runs three bistros in New Mexico. Very nice ambience. <a href="http://www.stclairwinery.com/bistros/albuquerque/">http://www.stclairwinery.com/bistros/albuquerque/</a></p>

<p><strong>St. James Tea Room</strong>: Incredible dining and creative imagination combine in an intimate series of dining spaces, each discreetly separated from its neighbor. You can delight in a 3-course Afternoon Tea experience seated outside in a private garden or inside in Victorian-decorated rooms. Dinners are by reservation only. The desserts are exquisite, but served in small portions so that you may indulge in as many or few as you wish. The selection of tea is not only broad, but deep in quality and individually pot-brewed. <a href="http://www.stjamestearoom.com">www.stjamestearoom.com</a>.</p>

<p><a href="http://blog.lesterpickerphoto.com/wp-content/uploads/2011/07/LAP9972.jpg"><img class="aligncenter size-medium wp-image-1278" title="St. James Tearoom" src="http://blog.lesterpickerphoto.com/wp-content/uploads/2011/07/LAP9972-300x199.jpg" alt="" width="300" height="199"></a></p>

<h2>LODGING</h2>


<p><strong>Hotel Albuquerque at Old Town</strong>: Located just a few blocks from the Old Town Plaza tourist district, this is a comfortable, mainstream hotel with a full complement of amenities. The lobby and rooms are nicely decorated with a Hispanic influence. Breakfasts are excellent. Staff is very helpful. <a href="http://www.hotelabq.com/">http://www.hotelabq.com/</a></p>

<p><strong>Nativo Hotel</strong>: decorated in a Native American theme, the hotel is full service, with a bar, dining area that serves all meals, large lounge, magazine rack. Rooms are tastefully decorated and spacious. I had two stays at the hotel and in each of my rooms dream catchers hung on the wall over my bed, which I’m attributing to my getting a great night’s sleep (okay, maybe my hiking and photographing all day helped a tad). One warning: if you book on a Saturday night you’d better be a stone-dead sleeper or plan to stay awake until 1:30 AM. That’s when the ultra loud, bass-thumping music from their weekly nightclub ends. It’s a great time for the young adult set, but convinces me that every young adult should be socking away money right now into investments in hearing aid companies. <a href="http://www.hhandr.com/nativo.php">http://www.hhandr.com/nativo.php</a></p>

		  <div class="entry-content"><p>I frequently get questions from readers concerning the safety of their photo equipment when they travel. This is no small concern. As cameras have shrunk and price tags have swollen, so has the tendency of light fingers to pick your pockets, so to speak, increased. Not a pretty picture.</p>

<p>So I was pleased to come across an article written by a photographer colleague, Ned Levi, who is one of the expert commentators and forum supervisors at the Nikonians website (<a href="http://www.nikonians.org">www.nikonians.org</a>). Ned is one of those incredibly knowledgeable resources who tirelessly imparts valuable info to newbies and pros alike.</p>

<p><a href="http://blog.lesterpickerphoto.com/wp-content/uploads/2011/07/packing_2010-07-22_1819%C2%A9LesterPicker.jpg"><img class="aligncenter size-medium wp-image-1272" title="packing_2010-07-22_1819©LesterPicker" src="http://blog.lesterpickerphoto.com/wp-content/uploads/2011/07/packing_2010-07-22_1819%C2%A9LesterPicker-225x300.jpg" alt="" width="225" height="300"></a></p>

<p>A couple of years ago Ned wrote an article for Consumer Traveler about traveling to Europe with photo equipment. When I read it I knew I wanted you all to see it because I have lots of friends who have been robbed while in Europe (and elsewhere). It&#8217;s chock full of great tips, from an experienced pro. Do yourself a favor; whether you&#8217;re traveling to Europe, Asia or the U.S. read this and be prepared.</p>

		  <div class="entry-content"><h2>MUSEUMS &amp; CULTURAL ATTRACTIONS</h2>


<p>In Part 1 I discussed events and things to do outdoors while in ABQ. Today it is museums and cultural attractions. In the final installment Ill cover restaurants (God, there are some great ones in ABQ!) and hotels.</p>

<p>One statistic has it that Albuquerque has more museums per capita than any other city its size. You could spend two weeks just touring its wonderful cultural treasures. Here’s a sampling from my recent trip:</p>

<p><strong>Anderson-Abruzzo Albuquerque International Balloon Museum</strong>: What a terrific little museum! Whether or not you’re into ballooning, this quirky museum has it all. From the history of ballooning to flight demonstrations, this is a fun venue for the entire family. It’s located next to the Balloon Fiesta Park, which is the epicenter of the annual Albuquerque balloon festival, held in October. <a href="http://www.balloonmuseum.com">www.balloonmuseum.com</a></p>

<p><a href="http://blog.lesterpickerphoto.com/wp-content/uploads/2011/06/LAP9634.jpg"><img class="size-medium wp-image-1262 " title="_LAP9634" src="http://blog.lesterpickerphoto.com/wp-content/uploads/2011/06/LAP9634-199x300.jpg" alt="" width="199" height="300"></a></p>

<p><strong>Indian Pueblo Cultural Center</strong>: A nicely designed building with lots of information about NM’s 19 pueblos. Every weekend highlights a dance troupe from one of the pueblos. These dances are not performances. They represent the pueblos actually sharing their spiritual dances and blessings with visitors. They are wonderful entertainment, as well as moving testimonies to Native American culture. You might see the Eagle Dance, Buffalo Dance, Butterfly Dance or others, each one explained, with opportunities to interact with the dancers. The Cultural Center includes a complex of buildings and exhibits. <a href="http://www.indianpueblo.org">www.indianpueblo.org</a></p>

<p><a href="http://blog.lesterpickerphoto.com/wp-content/uploads/2011/06/LAP9562.jpg"><img class="size-medium wp-image-1263" title="_LAP9562" src="http://blog.lesterpickerphoto.com/wp-content/uploads/2011/06/LAP9562-200x300.jpg" alt="" width="200" height="300"></a></p>

<p><strong>Explora! Museum</strong>: another must see for the entire family. From the moment you enter the doors, you are thrust into a kaleidoscopic whirlwind of activity. Everything is designed to be touched and manipulated (with frequent disinfecting by staff, btw). No instructions are provided, just exciting opportunities to experiment and be creative. Once a month is adult night. <a href="http://www.explora.us/en/">www.explora.us/en/</a></p>

<p><a href="http://blog.lesterpickerphoto.com/wp-content/uploads/2011/06/LAP0033.jpg"><img class="aligncenter size-medium wp-image-1264" title="Explora Museum" src="http://blog.lesterpickerphoto.com/wp-content/uploads/2011/06/LAP0033-300x199.jpg" alt="" width="300" height="199"></a></p>

<p><strong>National Institute of Flamenco</strong>: Wow, an absolute must see! The professional troupe is totally amazing, captivating, and energetic. You’ll find yourself holding your breath as the dancers go through their routines, adding colorful, extemporaneous flairs. The singing and chanting is very soulful and passionate.  <a href="http://www.nationalinstituteofflamenco.org">www.nationalinstituteofflamenco.org</a></p>

<p>For an iPhone video clip of two professional Flamenco dancers at the Institute, click here: <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MhI9ZdXSvZE">http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MhI9ZdXSvZE</a></p>

<p><strong>Albuquerque Biological Park</strong>: consists of a small aquarium, botanical garden and zoo, all of which are tailor made for families. Plus, Albuquerque’s nice weather makes this an ideal spot for a picnic. <a href="http://www.cabq.gov/biopark">www.cabq.gov/biopark</a></p>

<p><strong>National Museum of Nuclear Science and History</strong>: Another small museum experience, with invaluable subject matter in today’s atomic age. Lots of reading to do, but well laid out and balanced. From the history of atomic science to the ethics involved, this museum does a fine job of laying out the issues. Not for very young kids.  <a href="http://www.nuclearmuseum.org">www.nuclearmuseum.org</a></p>

<p><strong>New Mexico Museum of Natural History and Science</strong>: This family-friendly museum is a little jewel. One of the things that makes it so understandable is the linear progression of the exhibits, from the origin of the universe, through life on earth, dinosaurs, and present day environments. Lots of hands-on activities for the kids, too. <a href="http://www.nmnaturalhistory.org">www.nmnaturalhistory.org</a></p>

<p><strong>National Hispanic Cultural Center</strong>: Located on a beautiful campus along the banks of the Rio Grande, the Center offers exhibits by nationally and internationally renowned artists and performers. Be sure to take in the Torreon Fresco, painstakingly painted by New Mexico artist Frederico Vigil. The 4,000 square foot work is the largest concave fresco in North America and beautifully depicts more than 3,000 years of Hispanic history.  <a href="http://www.nhccnm.org">www.nhccnm.org</a>/</p>

<p><strong>Acoma Sky City</strong>: Set on a mesa 360 feet above the high desert, Sky City is the oldest continually inhabited community in the United States. Plan for a solid half-day at the modern visitor&#8217;s center, art gallery, gift shop and cafe, before boarding a bus that winds its way up the mesa. The 75-minute tour of Sky City, with its commanding views of the high desert, is exclusively led by Acoma guides. <a href="http://sccc.acomaskycity.org">http://sccc.acomaskycity.org</a>/</p>

		  <div class="entry-content"><p>Mention Albuquerque, New Mexico and what immediately comes to mind is their famous International Balloon Fiesta, held every October. Drawing thousands of balloonists and tens of thousands of tourists from around the world, the festival is a New Mexico icon. It’s a fun, colorful, high-energy, week-long celebration pairing ballooning with myriad venues and activities generated by local entrepreneurs.</p>

<p>But, I’m here to tell you that there is more to Albuquerque than ballooning. Far more. I’ve been to Albuquerque before, but I recently spent 8 days there, intensely exploring its hotels and restaurants, museums and adventure opportunities for a travel article. I came away impressed. So impressed, in fact, I am going to split my review into three parts, simply because there was so much to do and such terrific eats. Here I’ll discuss Things to See and Do; in Part 2 I’ll discuss Museums and other Cultural Attractions; in Part 3 I’ll discuss my choices for Eats and Retreats. Throughout, I’ll be using the airport abbreviation for Albuquerque (ABQ).</p>

<h3><strong>Weather</strong></h3>


<p>The weather in ABQ is relatively mild. I say relatively, because winter can be cold, with temps dipping into the twenties. On the other end of the thermometer, temps can top out at 100F.  But temperatures usually fluctuate between the upper forties and lower nineties. That’s pretty mild in my book. However, please keep in mind that when I visited in May for this series of blogs and magazine articles, the temperatures were an ideal 55-80, with bright, sunny skies and little humidity… except when it rained. Mind you, I’m talking in and around the city proper. Once you get into the high desert environment, temps can be brutal in summer.</p>

<h3>Camera</h3>


<p>I find that a point-and-shoot or a DSLR with a general purpose lens works best for touring around. In the case of these images, for example, I took most with my Nikon D700 and 24-70mm lens.</p>

<h2>HIGH ADVENTURE</h2>


<p><strong>The ABQ Trolley</strong>: This is one delightful, sit-back-and-enjoy experience as the two friends (and former tourism officials) who started it continue to run it. The running narration is very funny, as well as informative. By time you disembark, you’ll have a real sense of the city. The tour includes travel along historic Route 66, Old Town, Nob Hill and Downtown. <a href="http://www.abqtrolley.com">http://www.abqtrolley.com</a></p>

<a href="http://www.abqtrolley.com"></a></p>

<p><strong>Sandia Peak Tramway</strong>: this is the world’s longest tramway and is a must-experience venue that soars over the Cibola National Forest. Terminating at 10,378 feet, the peak boasts a restaurant and commanding views. It also brings riders to the ski lodge during the winter season. The ride to the top is enjoyable, with expansive views of the landscape. At twilight, if the sun is right, the Sandia mountains blaze with their namesake watermelon color. <a href="http://www.sandiapeak.com">www.sandiapeak.com </a></p>

<p><a href="http://www.sandiapeak.com"></a></p>

<p><strong>Hot Air Ballooning</strong>: Is there any sport in Albuquerque more iconic than hot air ballooning? Balloon rides are an inexpensive (relatively) and unique way to view Albuquerque and its environs. <em>Rainbow Ryders</em> is the largest balloon company in ABQ, attesting to the skill and business acumen of Scott Apelman, its founder. With more than 4500 balloon flights, Apelman is considered the dean of ballooning in Duke City (another name for ABQ, having nothing to do with John Wayne… stay tuned). <a href="http://www.rainbowryders.com">www.rainbowryders.com </a></p>

<p><strong>Jeep Tours</strong>: Try <em>New Mexico Jeep Tours</em>. Run by former Albuquerque police detective Roch Hart, be prepared for a jeep tour like no other. This is not about high-speed buggy rides. This is a thoughtful exploration of the high desert environment, including its wildlife, geology and native culture, run by a passionate professional. <a href="http://www.nmjeeptours.com">www.nmjeeptours.com </a></p>

<p><strong> </strong></p>

<p><strong>Old Town Walking Tour</strong>: sign up for an informative tour of Old Town and learn about its history from 1706 to the present. Enjoy stops at San Felipe de Neri church (the oldest building in the city) and the more than 100 shops, art galleries and restaurants.

<p><strong>Canoeing/Kayaking</strong>: Although I didn’t personally kayak or canoe on my recent visit, I do know that several tour operators run guided tours in and around Albuquerque. The Albuquerque Convention and Visitors Bureau is a great resource: <a href="http://www.itsatrip.org">www.itsatrip.org</a></p>

<h2>PARKS , HIKES &amp; TRAILS</h2>


<p><strong>Petroglyph National Monument</strong>: right in Albuquerque and easy to get to, the monument allows one to amble through paths that showcase prehistoric Native American art carved into rock. There are more than 20,000 carvings of people, insects, birds, mammals, and even symbols and geometric designs that we still do not understand (Area 51, anyone?).

<p><strong>Sandia Mountain Trails</strong>: Albuquerque is an outdoor town, with mild year-round temperatures that encourage its residents to stay active. The trail system through and surrounding ABQ is second to none and offers easy to difficult trekking levels. Hike, bike, horseback ride, run, photograph. <a href="http://www.sandiahiking.com">www.sandiahiking.com</a></p>

<p><strong>Some Outdoor Precautions</strong></p>

<p>Here are a few things to keep in mind when visiting New Mexico in general. ABQ, in particular, is at 5,000+ feet, so sunlight issues are magnified.</p>

<p>1.  Slather on sunscreen whenever you go outside, especially in summer. The sun and altitude are unforgiving. Bring it with you on hikes and reapply as needed.</p>

<p>2.  Bring twice as much water as you think you’ll need.</p>

<p>3.  If you are hiking, know the terrain. Better yet, hire a guide.</p>

<p>4.  Know your physical limitations and respect them.</p>

<p>5.  Let people know where you’ll be hiking and when you expect to return.</p>

<p>6.  Be snake aware. Wearing snake gaitors may look dorky, but they work, since most snake strikes are below the knee. However, it would be unusual to find snakes on established paths. Still, watch your step.</p>

<p>7.  Carry snack food with you.</p>

		  <div class="entry-content"><p>As photographers we hear about and discuss ‘noise’ quite a bit. For you photography newbies, digital noise is equivalent to what we used to call ‘grain’ in film days.</p>

<p>By now my readers know that I’m not one to waste a lot of space on highly technical explanations. If you want to understand noise or grain at a technical level, there are some fine resources out there. Just start by Googling the terms “film grain” and “digital camera noise” or “digital sensor noise” and you’ll soon be an expert (or intolerably bored). You might also try my associate, Bob Boyer’s, blog where he regularly waxes highly technical on weighty issues like digital noise, color balance and other issues (<a href="http://photo.rwboyer.com">http://photo.rwboyer.com/</a>). Suffice it to say that digital noise gives an image a grainy look and shows up most noticeably in the shadow areas of an image. Most people would consider the look distracting at best.</p>

<p>Noise will begin to appear in an image when you raise the ISO, usually above 400 or 800, depending on the quality of the camera sensor and whether or not the image contains lots of shadow areas. I, myself, rarely shoot at 800, since I most often shoot landscapes and try to shoot at ISO 200 or below to minimize noise. The “native” ISO of most modern DSLR cameras is around 200, meaning that their sensors are optimized for that ISO, so it’s usually a good bet to stick with that ISO number for images where fine detail is paramount.</p>

<p>Here’s the problem; if the light is poor, to stay at ISO 200 you would need to hand-hold the camera at a shutter speed that might cause blurring due to hand shake. As I’ve gotten older, I can no longer hand-hold any slower than 1/30 of a second depending, of course, on the weight of the lens I’m using. So, what many photographers do is simply increase the ISO to compensate. For example, let’s say I’m shooting an old factory building in Baltimore, the nearest city to where I live, on an overcast day. I want good depth of field, so I’m going to shoot at f16 and I’m on ISO 200. My camera tells me that with the lens I’m using, I need to shoot at 1/15 of a second. Not good for me. So I up my ISO to 400. Now I can shoot at 1/30. If I up it to ISO 800, I can shoot at 1/60. Great.</p>

<p>But wait. At ISO 800, the shadow areas of the building are showing up on my LCD screen a bit grainy. What I usually choose to do is use a tripod, eliminating hand shake and allowing me to shoot at 1/15. But, I don’t have a tripod with me. What do I do?</p>

<p>The answer may very well be: do nothing. Go ahead and shoot at ISO 800. Shoot at 1600. Shoot at 3200. The point here is that digital noise, by itself, is not good or bad. It is a tool in your photographic toolbox. In this case you may very well want to emphasize noise, creating a dark, moody, gritty interpretation of the scene.</p>

<p><a href="http://blog.lesterpickerphoto.com/wp-content/uploads/2011/06/untitled-154-of-170.jpg"><img class="size-medium wp-image-1244" title="Capetown, South Africa" src="http://blog.lesterpickerphoto.com/wp-content/uploads/2011/06/untitled-154-of-170-200x300.jpg" alt="" width="200" height="300"></a></p>

<p>I remember when I was training as a cub reporter and purchased my very first Nikon camera. I practiced all the time, since I could use the paper’s darkroom for free on my own time. I would watch some of the veteran photojournalists pull a photo from the soup, almost always a crisp, clean shot. But then one of the men (they were almost all men in those days) was on assignment for a story on inner city crime. He pulled out a photo that had me spellbound. The image of the darkened street was underexposed. The drug dealer leaning against the corner lamppost was in shadow. The scene was full of grain. Its grittiness perfectly captured the feel of the dangerous street underworld.</p>

<p><a href="http://blog.lesterpickerphoto.com/wp-content/uploads/2011/06/1981-11-Egypt-Luxor-boatbuilder_edited-1.jpg"><img class="size-medium wp-image-1245" title="Boat rebuilder, Aswan, Egypt" src="http://blog.lesterpickerphoto.com/wp-content/uploads/2011/06/1981-11-Egypt-Luxor-boatbuilder_edited-1-236x300.jpg" alt="" width="236" height="300"></a></p>

<p>Give yourself permission to experiment with noise, even if you are a landscape photographer. Up the ISO, especially on dark, brooding days when you might be prone to pack up and wait for sunnier conditions. You just might like what you see!</p>

		  <div class="entry-content"><p>Just got back from a wonderful fiction writer&#8217;s conference in San Diego (more on that in a later blog). Getting there and back necessitated 4 flights segments, so I had to listen to the &#8220;fasten your seatbelt&#8221; instruction 4 times.</p>

<p><a href="http://blog.lesterpickerphoto.com/wp-content/uploads/2011/06/fasten-seat-belt-fa.jpg"><img class="size-medium wp-image-1239" title="Stock Photo" src="http://blog.lesterpickerphoto.com/wp-content/uploads/2011/06/fasten-seat-belt-fa-200x300.jpg" alt="" width="200" height="300"></a></p>

<p style="text-align: center;"></p>


<p>The thought occurs to me: Is there a moron anywhere in the world who doesn&#8217;t know how to buckle a seatbelt?? Do we really still need flight attendants worldwide instructing us on how to fasten a seat belt? Does anyone have any idea of how much time is wasted every day on this inane instruction?</p>

<p>The way I figure it, anyone who doesn&#8217;t know how to buckle a seatbelt should be removed from the gene pool anyway! Then again, seatbelt or not, what are your chances of making it out alive from a plane crash?</p>

<p>I think that anyone over age 5 should have to pass a seat belt buckling proficiency test before boarding. If you flunk, you are sent down to the rental car counter where- does this makes any sense?- you can rent a car without any seatbelt instruction whatsoever, even though seat belts are well proven to save lives in the event of a car crash. Go figure!</p>

		  <div class="entry-content"><p>Having a daughter who lives in northern Vermont is a good thing, especially if you’re a photographer. When I visit, and she’s out shopping or working, I can take the time to grab my camera gear and just poke around, exploring Vermont’s back roads.</p>

<p>Speaking of Vermont’s roads, the Northern Kingdom (what locals call the far northern part of the state) must have one of the highest percentages of unpaved to paved roads in the country, forcing me to slow down and soak in the myriad small farms, forest lots and old New England homes that beautify the landscape. I must average 10 miles/hour, craning my neck this way and that, deciding on what will make a good image. Anyone following me on a GPS would think I was nuts, considering how many times I back up or make u-turns.</p>

<h3>Barr Hill Natural Area</h3>


<p>So a few days ago I came across a tiny jewel of a park in northern Vermont, tucked away in a remote area, that is absolutely perfect for photography. It’s called Barr Hill Natural Area. Covering a tad more than 250 acres, the 7/10-mile nature trail loops through the property with a few side spurs and is smartly laid out for a small park. Barr Hill is run by The Nature Conservancy (thank you!). Despite very little change in elevation this highlands trail weaves in and out of beautiful scenics as you hike into and out of the woods.</p>

<p><a href="http://blog.lesterpickerphoto.com/wp-content/uploads/2011/06/LAP1063-Panorama.jpg"><img class="size-medium wp-image-1233" title="_LAP1063 Panorama" src="http://blog.lesterpickerphoto.com/wp-content/uploads/2011/06/LAP1063-Panorama-300x296.jpg" alt="" width="300" height="296"></a></p>

<p>At the entrance to the trail, there is a sign-in book and free brochures that include a map of the loop. Along the way you encounter numbered posts that correspond to interpretive information in the brochure about what you are seeing. The guide is informative without being overwhelming especially if, like me, you’ll be putting down your tripod and camera each time you read the information.</p>

<p>Few people come to this remote preserve. On a Friday, I only met one couple hiking together. That gave me time to amble, looking for possible images. In the end I only took a few images since I had only two lenses with me and limited time. But I did write down a few places that I think would lend themselves to winter scenics. I intend to be back.</p>

<p>The park is situated at 2,100 feet elevation, so when there are clearings in the woods, you can see for miles. The area around Barr Hill is home to moose, white-tailed deer, and black bear, as well as many small mammals and birds. All forest growth is relatively recent, as the mountain was extensively logged in the 19<sup>th</sup> century.</p>

<p><a href="http://blog.lesterpickerphoto.com/wp-content/uploads/2011/06/LAP1068-Panorama.jpg"><img class="aligncenter size-medium wp-image-1234" title="_LAP1068 Panorama" src="http://blog.lesterpickerphoto.com/wp-content/uploads/2011/06/LAP1068-Panorama-266x300.jpg" alt="" width="266" height="300"></a></p>

<h3>Getting There</h3>


<p>Getting to the park is part of the charm of the outing. I drove down gravel roads, along small dairy farms with stone fences, and finally up a long, rutted road to the preserve’s tiny entrance. Here are the directions, taken straight from The Nature Conservancy brochure (with a few modifications by me):</p>

<p>At the center of Greensboro, VT find Willey’s General Store. Then take Wilson Street north for 0.1 mile. Bear right at the Greensboro Town Hall onto Lauredon Ave. Drive 0.6 mile and at a fork in the road, bear left onto Barr Hill Road, which is clearly marked. Go 1 mile to the Barr Hill Natural Area sign. Just before the sign on your left you will see a small winter parking area (you’ll have to hike to the park entrance during winter season). In other seasons, continue past the sign and gate for another 0.6 mile to a small trailhead parking area with room for 8-9 cars. Look for the Nature Trail sign and register box.</p>

<p>Enjoy!</p>

		  <div class="entry-content"><p>Pssst! Here’s one of the best-kept secrets in America. It’s called the America the Beautiful – National Parks and Federal Recreational Lands – Senior Pass.</p>

<p><a href="http://blog.lesterpickerphoto.com/wp-content/uploads/2011/06/SeniorFRT.jpg"><img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-1229" title="SeniorFRT" src="http://blog.lesterpickerphoto.com/wp-content/uploads/2011/06/SeniorFRT.jpg" alt="" width="285" height="180"></a></p>

<p>The Senior Pass is available to any citizen (or permanent resident) over age 62 and can only be obtained in person at any National Park, Bureau of Land Management (BLM), Fish and Wildlife Service and many Department of Agriculture offices. I got mine while in New Mexico photographing at a BLM site. If you are a senior photographer, this has got to be the best deal around.</p>

<p>Unlike the Annual Pass for National Parks and other federal lands, the Senior Pass is good for a lifetime, or what’s left of it when you get to be 62. Participating agencies include the National Park Service, U.S. Department of Agriculture - Forest Service, Fish and Wildlife Service, Bureau of Land Management and Bureau of Reclamation. The Annual Pass is $80/ year, while the Senior Pass- drumroll, please- is an unbelievable $10! That’s for the aforementioned lifetime.</p>

<p>The pass admits the pass holder and passengers in a non-commercial vehicle at per vehicle fee areas and pass holder and 3 adults, at per person fee areas (children under 16 are admitted free). Many of us photographers find ourselves on BLM or Forest Service land, so the pass is quite versatile. On my recent New Mexico trip, I photographed primarily on BLM and National Monument lands.</p>

<p>The Senior Pass provides a 50% discount on some Expanded Amenity Fees charged for facilities and services such as camping, swimming, boat launch, and specialized interpretive services. Naturally, in those cases where Expanded Amenity Fees are charged, only the pass holder is given the 50% price reduction. The pass is non-transferable and generally does NOT cover or reduce special recreation permit fees or fees charged by concessionaires.</p>

<p>If you qualify, make sure that when you sign up you also ask for the rearview mirror hanging tag. You use that in park areas that are unstaffed when you enter. That happens often with photographers, since we often show up well before sunrise.</p>

		  <div class="entry-content"><p>As a travel writer and photographer, I’m often asked about tipping. Do you tip? How much in France? How much in Africa? For what services? Professionally, I divide tipping into two categories; photography and everything else.</p>

<h3>Photography</h3>


<p>Let’s start with photography. At my photo workshops I often instruct people not to tip to allow you to take a person’s photograph. I’m not saying this like I have the moral high ground. I know this is a difficult issue and why short-change a few shekels to someone who is making $25 a month, on a good month?</p>

<p><a href="http://blog.lesterpickerphoto.com/wp-content/uploads/2011/06/bedouin-woman.jpg"><img class="size-medium wp-image-1223" title="bedouin woman" src="http://blog.lesterpickerphoto.com/wp-content/uploads/2011/06/bedouin-woman-240x300.jpg" alt="" width="240" height="300"></a></p>

<p>Aside from the fact that tipping for photos just encourages everyone to ask for money, making all our photo efforts that much more difficult, in my personal opinion I do believe that tipping is insulting to those you photograph. It turns them into subjects/objects rather than real people with whom we can establish a genuine connection.</p>

<p>Here’s how I work. Let’s say I’m in a market, which is one of my favorite places to capture people in the context of their culture. I roam around, camera casually hanging from my shoulder. I meet people’s eyes. I talk to them. I smile a lot, not to curry favor, but because I’m usually thoroughly enjoying myself. I ask questions about their craft or children. I laugh at my poor language skills. I buy something. (I admit it also helps if I have my wife along. Her winning smile and joie de vivre somehow both attracts people and puts them at ease.)</p>

<p>Only after this “relationship-building” phase will I ask, either by word or gesture, if I may take their picture. I am rarely refused and I’ve never had to pay. There have been exceptions, but usually because I was rushed and didn’t follow my normal modus operandi. I find that in this way the subject feels respected. We’ve made a human connection.</p>

<p><a href="http://blog.lesterpickerphoto.com/wp-content/uploads/2011/06/ecuadorpotatolady.jpg"><img class="size-medium wp-image-1224" title="ecuadorpotatolady" src="http://blog.lesterpickerphoto.com/wp-content/uploads/2011/06/ecuadorpotatolady-201x300.jpg" alt="" width="201" height="300"></a></p>

<p>If I’m in a rush and I snap a picture before asking for permission, I will delete it immediately if the person objects. Of course, as a pro, I have to have a signed permission form to use it in publications, so I carry cards, ready to hand out. I always show the resulting picture to the subject immediately, which is one of the joys of digital. I will also bring prints with me when I return to a spot or mail them to people when possible.</p>

<p><a href="http://blog.lesterpickerphoto.com/wp-content/uploads/2011/06/ecuadorbaby-mother.jpg"><img class="size-medium wp-image-1225" title="ecuadorbaby-mother" src="http://blog.lesterpickerphoto.com/wp-content/uploads/2011/06/ecuadorbaby-mother-300x188.jpg" alt="" width="300" height="188"></a></p>

<p>So much for photography tipping.</p>

<h3>Everything Else</h3>


<p>I know that the issue of tipping bothers some people. I mean really bothers them. Their argument is, why do I have to pay extra for good service? That should be expected. I agree. But tipping really is a mindset, and a form of travel etiquette.</p>

<p>The reality of modern life is that the tip is the norm. Wait staff rarely make a living wage without it. Ditto with bellhops and a host of occupations, especially when traveling in developing nations. What I do I learned from traveling to dozens of countries on all continents (except Antarctica, which I will remedy soon).</p>

<p>In the USA I generally add 20% to pre-tax restaurant bills and 15% in Canada, more if the service is exceptional. At airports I give a buck for each bag to the driver who loads/unloads them onto the shuttle bus and at curbside check-in. In hotels, I always leave $3-5/day for the housekeeper. If I will be staying for more than a few days, I usually pull the weekday housekeeper aside, get her name, give her an upfront tip and tell her I’ll be giving her an additional tip if she takes exceptional care of our room. Works wonders, but has no effect on bedbugs!</p>

<p>In Europe, I generally tip 10-15%. Central and South America, 10-15%. In Africa the norm is 5-10%, although that appears to be increasing. In Egypt, for example, make sure that the tip is not included in the bill before adding one yourself.</p>

<p>Australia is 10-15% for me, but New Zealand really depends. It’s a much more independent minded people and they will sometimes refuse a tip. Be sensitive to that. Ask, but don’t force a tip on someone who is reluctant. A nice thank-you will do.</p>

<p>Most people experience Africa and Egypt, in particular (Egypt is considered north Africa), through guided tours. Here is where I get the most complaints, since tourists might spend $5,000-10,000 or more for a tour, so why do they have to tip over and above that? Get over it. Tips are expected for your guide, porters, housekeepers. Right from the get-go, adjust your mindset. It’s not a $10,000 trip; it’s an $11,500 trip (okay, with liquor it’s a $15,0000 trip!).</p>

<p>The best way I have found to handle the correct amount is by asking the tour operator in advance what is the range of tip expected. Select your comfort level from within that range and give the people your tip directly, preferably the night before your last day. In many cases tips are all the compensation that person will get. Oh, and carry cash for the tip. Many of these workers do not have access to a bank and can’t cash a check.</p>

<p>On cruises, there are gratuity guidelines published by every cruise line. They even offer the option of signing up in advance for their standard tipping regime (or pencil in your own number) and having it auto-charged to your credit card. The staff is informed that you elected that option, although they do not know the exact amount. In general, plan for $15-20/day for gratuities that cover wait staff and housekeepers.</p>

<p>I like to think that my tipping conduct is a goodwill gesture advancing public opinion of Americans (or whatever your nationality) far more effectively than does our government’s policies. That’s my story and I’m sticking to it.</p>

<p><strong>I’d love to hear your opinions about tipping and any funny or just plain interesting stories about tipping.</strong></p>

		  <div class="entry-content"><p>If you are a reader of this blog, you probably already know that one of my goals is to learn large format (LF) photography this year. By ‘learn’ I don’t mean to become expert in its use. I’d be a fool to say that, given that some incredible photographers have spent a lifetime mastering this art form.</p>

<p>What I’m trying to do is determine whether a view camera has a role in producing the kind of prints that my clients are increasingly demanding; really huge prints that are crisp and clear and vibrant. I’m trying other techniques, but LF is currently my main focus, so to speak. I also promised to keep you all updated on my progress.</p>

<p>Now, I’m the kind of guy who digests as much as possible from books and articles. But, when it comes down to the nitty-gritty, I learn best from a mentor and from actually putting pedal to metal and trying things out.</p>

<p>Fortunately, for anyone wanting to get into LF, I found a terrific resource in Fred Newman, owner of The View Camera Store (<a href="http://www.viewcamerastore.com">www.viewcamerastore.com</a>). Fred has not only been selling this stuff for years, but he’s an accomplished LF photographer himself. That’s an unbeatable combo in my mind.</p>

<h3>A Simple Solution</h3>


<p>After fiddling around for two months near my home, I was ready to test my skills in the American southwest. One thing I was having trouble with was the focusing hood, which is the cloth that a LF photog throws over his head to focus the image on the glass screen. As it turns out, The View Camera Store offers the BTZS Focus Hood. I tried it out in several national parks around Albuquerque and I’ve got to say that hood is the best thing since sliced bread.</p>

<p><a href="http://blog.lesterpickerphoto.com/wp-content/uploads/2011/06/hood.jpg"><img class="size-medium wp-image-1214" title="hood" src="http://blog.lesterpickerphoto.com/wp-content/uploads/2011/06/hood-300x182.jpg" alt="" width="300" height="182"></a></p>

<p style="text-align: center;"></p>


<p>I had been frustrated by other well made, but cumbersome hoods. The BTZS is simple, very well made and dual function. When carrying my camera on my tripod, I use it as a protective cover. While focusing, its long Velcro closure allows me to manipulate it to shut out as much light as needed. It works even in the brightest southwest light.</p>

<p>Fred has a straightforward video explaining its use on YouTube, this one for a 4x5 view camera like the one I use. However, his store sells hoods for any size view camera.</p>

<p><a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2IduAabNQpY">http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2IduAabNQpY</a></p>

<p>Fred spent as much time as I needed on the phone with me advising me on other issues, such as loading and unloading my film out in the field. By time I left on my trip, I felt confident that I had a handle on my workflow.</p>

<p>I’ll report back on the results in a future blog.</p>

<p>If I had to distill what I teach in a photo workshop to one lesson, it would be this: What exactly are you trying to say through that image? If you can tell me in 10 or 25 words exactly what the point of the image is, then we’re most probably looking at a good, maybe even a great image.</p>

<p>I know that sounds simplistic- any one ‘magic’ rule is- but the lack of a clear concept is what keeps a so-so image from being a wow! image. I see this in every type of photography, but most especially in landscapes and wildlife, where weather, land forms, flora and fauna, light and shadow all interact to add complexity that can obscure the meaning of the image.</p>

<h3>Is It Just For Identification?</h3>


<p>Here’s an example. Someone goes to a pristine habitat and comes back with an image of, say, a bear or moose or wolf. It might be a technically good shot; crisply focused, well lit, saturated colors. But the image just isn’t dynamic. Most of the time it is a full body shot of the animal and I think to myself, “Hmmm, that’s a nice bear identification photo for an ecology textbook.” But, was that the photographer’s intent? What did s/he want to say to us? What s/he mean for us to <strong><em>feel</em></strong>?</p>

<p>If you’re a taxonomist, then the story you are trying to tell is relatively simple, and I have no argument with you over it. This is lion; this is tiger; this is coyote. But I’ve met few taxonomic photographers in my day and even fewer people who would be dazzled by their images.</p>

<p>So, I always go back to the question: What is the story you are trying to tell through this image? What are you trying to say? What do you want to transmit to the viewer?</p>

<p>In many of the images I am asked to critique, the problem is too much information crowding the scene. In an awestruck moment, facing an incredibly beautiful scene, the photographer is often tempted to get everything possible into the image. The result is usually an inscrutable mess. Believe me, every time I go to the Grand Canyon I’m sorely tempted to capture it’s indescribable beauty in a single image, so I know the conundrum. But, after many visits, and perhaps the wisdom of years, I realize it’s plain impossible for me to do this. Now I capture what I call landscape vignettes of the Canyon and hope that together they tell the story.</p>

<h3>Lesson Relearned</h3>


<p>I was reminded of all this once again, as I prepared some images for exhibition and came across a sequence of images I had taken on a beautiful Fall day in the Canadian Rockies. I’ll give you some background and then let the images themselves speak to you.</p>

<p>I had just had a frightening bear encounter while I knelt in a stream, taking images that incorporated a distant mountain. As I stood up, not 15 feet away, was a big old black bear. Fortunately, he did not see or smell me, but the next several minutes were worrisome. I slowly removed my bear spray from my vest. I couldn’t take any images because it would alert the bear to my presence, so I received the time as a divine gift to just appreciate this beautiful creature. He eventually wandered off.</p>

<p>I drove a few miles down the road and stopped for lunch at a pond. As I got out of the car I noticed a mated pair of coyotes hunting across the pond. I snapped some images, even though they were out of range of my tele. I laid my camera down and started to eat.</p>

<p>In a few minutes, I felt the hair on my neck crawling. I turned slowly to see the male standing not 5 feet from me. He was so close, in fact, that my telephoto could not focus on him. I slowly put my food away, as I have a strict work ethic that does not allow me to feed wild animals. I spoke to him quietly, all the while setting up my camera-lens by feel to maximize my chances. With wild animals, photographic moments are fleeting. He backed away just enough for me to focus. I addressed him again, with some sounds that I have learned over the years garners the attention, if not disdain, of animals. He turned to look at me. I talked to him. He cocked his head this way and that. I answered. He responded. Click, click, talk, click, click. We connected.</p>

<h3>Your Call</h3>


<p>So here are the images. The first is “coyote,” maybe okay for a textbook. The second is… well… what does the second image say to you or do for <strong><em>you</em></strong>?</p>

		  <div class="entry-content"><p>There seems to be a growing trend toward large prints among my clients. Vaulted ceilings in homes, large lobbies in hospitals and clinics, airy office spaces all seem to call out for huge images.</p>

<p>At the same time, digital cameras are steadily improving, offering crisper images from densely packed sensors, allowing even 12-megapixel images to be blown up to a decent size. Add to that some amazing software programs that use complex algorithms to blow up images and you have the photo equivalent of a super-sized Big Mac.</p>

<p>One of the results of the desire for larger and larger prints is that I have just begun shooting with a large-format 4x5 film camera for some of my work. I’ll continue to report on that in future blogs. It’s kind of funny, this return to the past for modern imagery, but to succeed in this business you have to be responsive to client desires, whatever direction that takes you in.</p>

<h3>How We Work</h3>


<p>I thought I’d describe here how we handled some work for a recent client, a financial advisement firm in the town where I live. My client’s office is in a first-floor wing of a large Victorian home. When I first saw the client reception area, I knew it needed a major makeover. The walls were a very nice, but … how can I say this politely?.. challenging color and were plastered with an assortment of artwork, awards and plaques that gave a very disjointed appearance. Certainly the initial impression was not the elegant appearance worthy of my client’s reputation and his upscale clientele.</p>

<p><a href="http://blog.lesterpickerphoto.com/wp-content/uploads/2011/06/client-installation-walls_2011-01-19_1243%C2%A9LesterPicker.jpg"><img class="size-medium wp-image-1183" title="client installation walls_2011-01-19_1243©LesterPicker" src="http://blog.lesterpickerphoto.com/wp-content/uploads/2011/06/client-installation-walls_2011-01-19_1243%C2%A9LesterPicker-300x200.jpg" alt="" width="300" height="200"></a></p>

<p>So, we rolled up our sleeves and analyzed the space, as well as the client’s perceived needs. We then suggested a design arrangement that we thought would meet his goals while offering a quality experience for clients. We also convinced him to have the walls painted a neutral and more soothing color.</p>

<p>After finding out his preference for images from my stock collection, I suggested others that were similar but not on my photo gallery site (<a href="http://www.lesterpickerphoto.com">www.lesterpickerphoto.com</a>). A few backs-and-forths later we had our selection of images nailed.</p>

<p>Then came the decision on display media. Our company offers several different display styles, including traditional framed prints, aluminum prints, fiberboard and face-mounted plexiglas. Within those four basic choices we offer many variations, depending on the client’s needs.</p>

<p>The reception area in this case fills two main functions; those that support the administrative assistant and those that serve the client. Using those two functionally distinct areas, we selected a fiberboard option for the administrative area and front-mounted plexiglas in the client environment.</p>

<p>With those selections made, including print sizes, we were one-third done with the project. Now came the difficult work!</p>

<h3>Mastering the Print</h3>


<p>I handed off the images to Bob Boyer, my very able assistant. Bob is a master at many things photographic, but I’ve got to think that printmaking is at the top of the list. Bob has an intuitive feel for a print, combined with an expert technical grasp of print-making and wide experience with software products. Bob is able to factor image size, paper weight and finish, and presentation medium and somehow always come up with the perfect recipe for presenting the image in its best light.</p>

<p>As soon as Bob was done and I had suggested tweaks based on my personal artistic vision, off they went to the respective labs. We can do traditional prints here in our office up to 13”x19”, using the fine HP Photosmart Pro B9180. But for larger prints or for other modalities, we have relationships with some of the finest labs in the country.</p>

<p>So, off went the files to be mounted on fiberboard to a lab in California, with which we have been doing business for some time. Then we sent the face-mounted plexi files to a master craftsman, Tom Rieger of Rieger Communications in Maryland.</p>

<h3>Rieger Communications</h3>


<p>Tom is a pioneer in digital photography and I challenge anyone to come up with another person who knows more about the topic than does Tom. His company does high-end exhibit work for the Smithsonian and for museums throughout the country.</p>

<p>Here I am at Rieger’s massive facility with the print run for this installation, which Bob and I drove down to inspect before going to finals (I live about 90 minutes from Rieger’s lab and workshops).</p>

<p><a href="http://blog.lesterpickerphoto.com/wp-content/uploads/2011/06/P1010267-Ap3-5200-1.jpg"><img class="size-medium wp-image-1184" title="P1010267-Ap3-5200-1" src="http://blog.lesterpickerphoto.com/wp-content/uploads/2011/06/P1010267-Ap3-5200-1-300x200.jpg" alt="" width="300" height="200"></a></p>

<p>Every print is precisely color managed by Tom and his graphics staff. The next image shows the print run that we examine before mounting.</p>

<p>Tom&#8217;s shop has the ability to run exacting prints up to an astounding 100 inches wide!</p>

<p><a href="http://blog.lesterpickerphoto.com/wp-content/uploads/2011/06/P1010268-Ap3-5200-1.jpg"><img class="size-medium wp-image-1186 " title="P1010268-Ap3-5200-1" src="http://blog.lesterpickerphoto.com/wp-content/uploads/2011/06/P1010268-Ap3-5200-1-300x200.jpg" alt="" width="300" height="200"></a></p>

<h3>Show and Tell</h3>


<p>A week later the plexi-mounted prints were ready for installation. Here are some shots of my images hanging in the client’s office.</p>

<p><a href="http://blog.lesterpickerphoto.com/wp-content/uploads/2011/06/LAP9280.jpg"><img class="size-medium wp-image-1187" title="_LAP9280" src="http://blog.lesterpickerphoto.com/wp-content/uploads/2011/06/LAP9280-300x199.jpg" alt="" width="300" height="199"></a></p>

<p><a href="http://blog.lesterpickerphoto.com/wp-content/uploads/2011/06/LAP9324.jpg"><img class="size-medium wp-image-1188" title="_LAP9324" src="http://blog.lesterpickerphoto.com/wp-content/uploads/2011/06/LAP9324-199x300.jpg" alt="" width="199" height="300"></a></p>

<p>Blog readers are often curious about the process and I hope this has answered your logistical questions. But there is one other issue I’ll address up front, and that’s how this process feels to me.</p>

<p>It’s hard to describe how great my satisfaction is in seeing my work mounted in someone’s office or home and knowing they are enjoying it. Once every image is mounted on a wall or hanging in a space, I step back and recall every nuance of the shot. I think back on the preparation for the shoot, the weather conditions that day, the smells and sounds and visuals of the moment. I remember the discussions with my associate, Bob Boyer, as we prepped the image for printing and planned the design for the installation. Finally, after hours doing the installation we can step back and review the entire process. And, it feels great.</p>

<p>As always, I welcome your feedback.</p>

		  <div class="entry-content"><p>I love cutting out three or four days from my schedule and just rambling, camera in hand, to areas I have always wanted to visit or revisit. No schedule, no major assignment breathing down my neck, just the pure, unadulterated joy of being out in nature soaking it in.</p>

<p>For eight glorious days I was in New Mexico, four days on an assignment of sorts, and four days for myself, wandering through several National Monuments. I’ve already described Kasha-Katuwe Tent Rocks National Monument in a previous blog (<a href="http://blog.lesterpickerphoto.com/2011/05/25/tent-rocks-rocks/">http://blog.lesterpickerphoto.com/2011/05/25/tent-rocks-rocks/</a>), and here I’ll briefly describe El Morro and El Malpais National Monuments, which are near to each other and can be photographed in a day if you plan wisely. Of course, if you had a month and planned wisely, you’d have an even better photo experience!</p>

<h3>El Morro</h3>


<p>El Morro (The Headlands) is a smaller Monument than El Malpais. I love its accessibility, both for photographers and people with disabilities. From the visitors center there is a wonderful paved, circular path that takes one along the spectacular rock formation that is its mainstay scenic and to a small pool of water that was a godsend to the early settlers. The Zuni people built a pueblo atop the El Morro mesa around 1275 that eventually housed as many as 1,500 residents. The hikes around the mesa are populated with lots of interesting petroglyphs.</p>

<p>If you go early in the morning, the sun lights up the rock face and the pool area, so plan your visit to take full advantage of that. Hike around the mesa to get a feel for heavenly silence that the Zuni Indians were blessed with.</p>

<h3>El Malpais</h3>


<p>El Malpais is a much larger and more varied park. I’d recommend that, at the very least, you plan to shoot at Sandstone Buffs area for good panoramic images.</p>

<p><a href="http://blog.lesterpickerphoto.com/wp-content/uploads/2011/06/Sandstone-Bluffs-Panorama-1.jpg"><img class="size-medium wp-image-1176" title="Sandstone Bluffs Panorama-1" src="http://blog.lesterpickerphoto.com/wp-content/uploads/2011/06/Sandstone-Bluffs-Panorama-1-300x248.jpg" alt="" width="300" height="248"></a></p>

<p>Ten minutes down the road you can finish your tour at La Ventana natural arch. As the sun finally sets over the high desert, you’ll be treated to an incredible show as the arch lights up. It’s a dazzling way to end a satisfying photographic ramble.</p>

<p><a href="http://blog.lesterpickerphoto.com/wp-content/uploads/2011/06/LAP0869-Panorama.jpg"><img class="size-medium wp-image-1177" title="_LAP0869 Panorama" src="http://blog.lesterpickerphoto.com/wp-content/uploads/2011/06/LAP0869-Panorama-300x123.jpg" alt="" width="300" height="123"></a></p>

<h3>If You Go</h3>


<p>Remember to bring lots of water if you plan to hike to the top of the trail. Also, be sure to wear solid hiking shoes that cover your ankle; anything less and you’ll be dumping gritty sand from your shoes every few minutes. Because of the dust, I recommend that you keep your camera either in your backpack or in a protective bag and pull it out only as needed.</p>

<p>As with any hike in New Mexico, wear plenty of sunscreen, wear a hat (and long sleeves and pants if you are sun sensitive), sunglasses and watch out for snakes. The later warning is only generic, as Tent Rocks has enough human presence that snakes avoid the area… but watch out for snakes! I always carry a snake bite kit.</p>

<p>You will also want to plan your visit to accommodate early morning or late afternoon shooting. Look at a map and check on sunrise/sunset times so that you time your appearance for when those rock faces will be glowing.</p>

<p>Finally, make good use of the ranger stations at both parks. Your tax money pays for it, so why not take advantage of the rangers’ intimate knowledge of their surroundings and follow some of their recommendations. The stations also offer a variety of brochures and exhibits that will better inform your photography.</p>

		  <div class="entry-content"><p>You all probably know by now that I shoot travel, landscapes and wildlife nearly exclusively. I rarely shoot sports or ultra-fast action shots, like car races. But even wildlife shooters have a need for stopping fast action once in a while. Of course, if you are a bird photographer (God bless you all), you always need to stop action.</p>

<p>But now that I&#8217;m a &#8220;senior&#8221; photographer, my ability to hand-hold and control my camera at 1/30 or even 1/60 of a second has been severely compromised. Yet, I still want to capture that fast moving bear when I visit the Yukon, or a bird capturing its dinner. My solution is to use what is known as a Wimberley head mounted on my tripod.</p>

<p><a href="http://blog.lesterpickerphoto.com/wp-content/uploads/2011/05/LAP_4147.jpg"><img class="aligncenter size-medium wp-image-1168" title="LAP_4147" src="http://blog.lesterpickerphoto.com/wp-content/uploads/2011/05/LAP_4147-300x199.jpg" alt="" width="300" height="199"></a></p>

<p>Actually, since I travel often and have to backpack to remote locations, I use a lighter Wimberley Sidekick device, which quick-mounts perfectly onto my existing Really Right Stuff BH-55 ball head. It allows me to mount my Nikon 70-200 with a 1.4 tele-extender or a Nikon 200-400mm  and follow my subject smoothly and seamlessly, clicking away as I capture it in action.</p>

<p><a href="http://blog.lesterpickerphoto.com/wp-content/uploads/2011/05/LAP_4152.jpg"><img class="size-medium wp-image-1169" title="LAP_4152" src="http://blog.lesterpickerphoto.com/wp-content/uploads/2011/05/LAP_4152-199x300.jpg" alt="" width="199" height="300"></a></p>

<p>The Sidekick allows me to turn the entire head around 360 degrees. It also allows me full range of up and down movement. Every movement is smooth as silk with no herky-jerky sticking points. That alone allows me to freeze motion at slower shutter speeds, or to add motion blurs as I pan, with zero camera shake due to my hands and body.</p>

<p><a href="http://blog.lesterpickerphoto.com/wp-content/uploads/2011/05/LAP_4160.jpg"><img class="size-medium wp-image-1170" title="LAP_4160" src="http://blog.lesterpickerphoto.com/wp-content/uploads/2011/05/LAP_4160-199x300.jpg" alt="" width="199" height="300"></a></p>

<p>A brand new Sidekick goes for about $225, but I got mine used for under $100. I consider it an invaluable accessory when I&#8217;m out shooting wildlife.</p>

<p><a href="http://blog.lesterpickerphoto.com/wp-content/uploads/2011/05/LAP_4167.jpg"><img class="size-medium wp-image-1171" title="LAP_4167" src="http://blog.lesterpickerphoto.com/wp-content/uploads/2011/05/LAP_4167-300x199.jpg" alt="" width="300" height="199"></a></p>

<p>Note that you should mount your lens to the Sidekick, not the camera when using a telephoto. Then you can just twist the knurled knob on the lens to switch from landscape to portrait orientation.</p>

		  <div class="entry-content"><p>This is a strange tale, but one worth telling. I was in New Mexico, speaking one day with a Native American about the protocol for visiting sites considered spiritual. What many tribes did was to leave an offering, perhaps a sprinkling of tobacco or a keepsake, as a gift to Mother Earth for allowing the visitor to take away some of the spiritual essence of the special place.</p>

<p>A few days later I just happened to be photographing on a trail and considered climbing to a higher spot for what I thought would be a better vantage point. The more I shot down below, the more it gnawed at me that just a hundred or so yards higher I could capture a magnificent image. So, with 25-pound backpack on and a 4x5 view camera mounted on my tripod, I attempted the climb.</p>

<p>I knew as soon as I started that I might have bit off more than I could chew. The footing was loose and sandy, with big rocks giving way under my feet. By time I got halfway up, I was soaked in sweat and sucking air (altitude: 7,600 feet). But, I had gotten to a slightly better vantage point, so I decided to heed the warnings of the mountain spirits and go no further. I took off my backpack and my favorite Tilley hat and got to work.</p>

<p>For the next thirty minutes I marveled at the red rock walls, the green trees, the dry wind carrying the intoxicating scent of ponderosa pine up the slope. It was, as a colleague says, a Zen moment. It was truly a gift from the mountain spirits.</p>

<p>Finally, I had had it. I was tired and hungry since it was 7:00 PM and I had been up since 4:30 AM for sunrise.  So, I packed up and literally slid back down the treacherous trail as the sun was setting. When I got to the bottom I realized I had left my favorite Tilley hat where I had taken the photos. That hat had accompanied me all over the globe for the past 12 years. It has kept me warm on top of mountains and sailed with me on several oceans, protected me from bat guano in caves and bird droppings in forests, in the Amazon rains and Egypt’s sun. Sure, it had a few holes in it, but I loved that hat.</p>

<p>Then, I grinned. Unconsciously, I had remembered to leave my gift for the mountain spirits. I smiled all the way back to the car.</p>

		  <div class="entry-content"><p>A hearty congratulations to Barry and Gill in England, one of two winners of my free photo giveaway last month. Here are two photos that Barry took of the framed image, hanging in their lounge.</p>

<p><a href="http://blog.lesterpickerphoto.com/wp-content/uploads/2011/05/lester1.jpg"><img class="aligncenter size-medium wp-image-1145" title="lester1" src="http://blog.lesterpickerphoto.com/wp-content/uploads/2011/05/lester1-225x300.jpg" alt="" width="225" height="300"></a></p>

<p><a href="http://blog.lesterpickerphoto.com/wp-content/uploads/2011/05/lester2.jpg"><img class="aligncenter size-medium wp-image-1146" title="lester2" src="http://blog.lesterpickerphoto.com/wp-content/uploads/2011/05/lester2-225x300.jpg" alt="" width="225" height="300"></a></p>

<p>Gill gave us a heads-up on the process:</p>

<blockquote>
<div><strong><em>&#8220;I was given the task of choosing one of your prints, which I have to say was very hard, far too much choice. I managed to break it down to a seascape, the Hawaii sunset took it. It makes a change from looking out of our window at the British summer ha, ha.</em></strong></div>
<div><strong><em>
</em></strong></div>
<div><strong><em>
</em></strong></div>
<div><strong><em>&#8220;From there I went with what I felt would look the best in our lounge. The colours and lighting compliment our colour schemes, and the print now has pride of place on the wall.</em></strong></div>
<div><strong><em>
</em></strong></div>
<div><strong><em>
</em></strong></div>
<div><strong><em>&#8220;It also took a bit of time to pick the right frame, which is real Oak , (not often found here in the UK), and hopefully have done your fab photo justice.&#8221;</em></strong></div>
</blockquote>


<div>Thanks for the update, Gill, and Barry for the photos. May the image adorn your abode for many years to come and may you both enjoy it in good health!</div>


<div>Best Wishes,</div>

		  <div class="entry-content"><p>There are many things wonderful about Albuquerque, from its central New Mexico location to its fine restaurants, museums and outdoor activities. As a landscape photographer, I’d say that I most enjoy the myriad stunning vistas that are in or within an hour or two of Albuquerque’s center. Since one of my photographic goals this year is to expand my panorama skills, what better place to test out new techniques than the southwest?</p>

<h3>Kasha-Katuwe Tent Rocks National Monument</h3>


<p>I visited one of these sites last week, the incredible Kasha-Katuwe Tent Rocks National Monument, about an hour northwest of Albuquerque. Kasha-Katuwe means ‘white cliffs,’ which is immediately noticeable as you enter the Monument from the parking area (please click on photos to enlarge).</p>

<p><a href="http://blog.lesterpickerphoto.com/wp-content/uploads/2011/05/LAP0646-Panorama.jpg"><img class="size-medium wp-image-1155" title="_LAP0646 Panorama" src="http://blog.lesterpickerphoto.com/wp-content/uploads/2011/05/LAP0646-Panorama-290x300.jpg" alt="" width="290" height="300"></a></p>

<p>The hike is along a very sandy and dusty trail and before every shot sequence I had to brush my lens off with a lens brush. Even so I found dust on my sensor on many images. Still, the hike was so incredible (and the weather so miserable the first day), I came back a second day.</p>

<p>The 1.5 mile trail starts at an elevation of 5,570 feet and ends at the summit at 6,760 feet. But what you will traverse during that time- and I use the word time advisedly- will elicit oohs and aahs at every twist and turn in the trail. As you hike, you go back in geologic time, some 6-7 million years.</p>

<h3>Hoodoos</h3>


<p>The hoodoos you see throughout the hike were formed by the blast from a super-volcano that left deposits over 1,000 feet thick. Due to differences in the composition of the deposits, the soils have eroded differentially, leaving tall, inverted cones (hoodoos). Hoodoos that have rock caps on top are protected from erosion, while those without the caps are in various states of decay, creating the sandy footing throughout the monument.</p>

<p><a href="http://blog.lesterpickerphoto.com/wp-content/uploads/2011/05/LAP0559-Panorama.jpg"><img class="size-medium wp-image-1156" title="_LAP0559 Panorama" src="http://blog.lesterpickerphoto.com/wp-content/uploads/2011/05/LAP0559-Panorama-300x178.jpg" alt="" width="300" height="178"></a></p>

<p>The hike wasn’t easy for me. I decided to bring my Arca Swiss 4x5 large format view camera with me. But to use that heavy monstrosity, I needed my 35mm Nikon D700 to act as a spot meter, telling me how to expose the Velvia 50 film I use. So I was slogging uphill through sand that was sometimes ankle deep, carrying a 25-pound backpack and a 10-pound tripod with view camera mounted on it slung over my shoulder. Ouch!! if I keep up working with my 4x5 I’ll invest in a small  light meter, for sure.</p>

<p>The trail winds through a marvelous slot canyon, with some passages so narrow only one person at a time can squeeze through. This next image I took just at the beginning of the canyon. I was struck by the magnificent Ponderosa Pine roots set against the sheer rock walls and the distant trees. As I set up to shoot, it occurred to me that those roots were exposed over the years by torrential rainwater surging down the canyon. Eventually the root tissue becomes barked over for protection. This panorama shot doesn’t come close to its awesome size and commanding presence.</p>

<p><a href="http://blog.lesterpickerphoto.com/wp-content/uploads/2011/05/LAP0616-Panorama.jpg"><img class="size-medium wp-image-1157" title="_LAP0616 Panorama" src="http://blog.lesterpickerphoto.com/wp-content/uploads/2011/05/LAP0616-Panorama-300x112.jpg" alt="" width="300" height="112"></a></p>

<p>If you visit Albuquerque, and after you read this series of blogs you may well decide to do so, plan on a trip to Kasha-Katuwe Tent Rocks National Monument. You’ll not be disappointed.</p>

<h3>If You Go</h3>


<p>Remember to bring lots of water if you plan to hike to the top of the trail. Also, be sure to wear solid hiking shoes that cover your ankle; anything less and you’ll be dumping gritty sand from your shoes every few minutes. Because of the dust, I recommend that you keep your camera either in your backpack or in a protective bag and pull it out only as needed.</p>

<p>As with any hike in New Mexico, wear plenty of sunscreen, wear a hat (and long sleeves and pants if you are sun sensitive), sunglasses and watch out for snakes. The latter warning is only generic, as Tent Rocks has enough human presence that snakes avoid the area… but watch out for snakes!</p>

		  <div class="entry-content"><p>This week I visited Sky City, an ancient pueblo atop a 370-foot tall mesa in the high desert outside Albuquerque. The day was windy, overcast and cold, dust blowing everywhere. Yet, despite the weather, I was struck by the very special, even spiritual feelings this tiny village exudes. Built in the 12th century, archaeologists believe the community chose the mesa for defensive purposes. It’s sheer walls are pretty impressive, to be sure. Still, the tiny pueblo was decimated by the Spaniards, who killed 90% of the men, women and children in what is known as the Battle of Acoma. Years later, in a coordinated rebellion with other Pueblo people, the Acoma people drove the Spanish out of the region and regained their culture, albeit forever changed by the Spanish.</p>

<p>From the beautiful Sky City Cultural Center, a tourist bus crunches its way up the gravel road to the top, where 30 Acoma families rotate living for a year, to hold fast to their traditional ways and to ensure that Sky City remains the oldest continuously inhabited community in the United States. I still have much to learn about the Acoma, but on this day, for the brief time I had atop the mesa, I’ll let my camera be your guide (please click on each image to enlarge).</p>

<p><a href="http://blog.lesterpickerphoto.com/wp-content/uploads/2011/05/LAP0424.jpg"><img class="size-medium wp-image-1128" title="_LAP0424" src="http://blog.lesterpickerphoto.com/wp-content/uploads/2011/05/LAP0424-300x199.jpg" alt="" width="300" height="199"></a></p>

<p>The views from atop the mesa are stunning, with vast expanses of high desert interspersed with nearby mesas.</p>

<p><a href="http://blog.lesterpickerphoto.com/wp-content/uploads/2011/05/sky-city-pueblo-6.jpg"><img class="size-medium wp-image-1129" title="sky city pueblo-6" src="http://blog.lesterpickerphoto.com/wp-content/uploads/2011/05/sky-city-pueblo-6-300x199.jpg" alt="" width="300" height="199"></a></p>

<p>The Acoma people live in these homes today. Some are simple adobe construction, others have been renovated with stone or brick.</p>

<p><a href="http://blog.lesterpickerphoto.com/wp-content/uploads/2011/05/Sky-city-pueblo_1.jpg"><img class="size-medium wp-image-1130" title="Sky city pueblo_1" src="http://blog.lesterpickerphoto.com/wp-content/uploads/2011/05/Sky-city-pueblo_1-199x300.jpg" alt="" width="199" height="300"></a></p>

<p>The Acoma people still value their traditional ways. The kiva is a place for rituals and meetings. The ladder serves a ceremonial as well as a utilitarian purpose.</p>

<p><a href="http://blog.lesterpickerphoto.com/wp-content/uploads/2011/05/sky-city-pueblo-3.jpg"><img class="size-medium wp-image-1131" title="sky city pueblo-3" src="http://blog.lesterpickerphoto.com/wp-content/uploads/2011/05/sky-city-pueblo-3-199x300.jpg" alt="" width="199" height="300"></a></p>

<p><a href="http://blog.lesterpickerphoto.com/wp-content/uploads/2011/05/sky-city-pueblo-2_.jpg"><img class="aligncenter size-medium wp-image-1132" title="sky city pueblo-2_" src="http://blog.lesterpickerphoto.com/wp-content/uploads/2011/05/sky-city-pueblo-2_-199x300.jpg" alt="" width="199" height="300"></a></p>

<p>The mission church still stands, although many Acoma people prefer traditional spiritual beliefs. The church is also used as a meeting place.</p>

<p><a href="http://blog.lesterpickerphoto.com/wp-content/uploads/2011/05/sky-city-pueblo-4.jpg"><img class="size-medium wp-image-1133" title="sky city pueblo-4" src="http://blog.lesterpickerphoto.com/wp-content/uploads/2011/05/sky-city-pueblo-4-199x300.jpg" alt="" width="199" height="300"></a></p>

<p>There is no plumbing in Sky City, so outhouses are clustered in various locations within the mesa.</p>

<p><a href="http://blog.lesterpickerphoto.com/wp-content/uploads/2011/05/sky-city-pueblo-5.jpg"><img class="size-medium wp-image-1134" title="sky city pueblo-5" src="http://blog.lesterpickerphoto.com/wp-content/uploads/2011/05/sky-city-pueblo-5-300x199.jpg" alt="" width="300" height="199"></a></p>

<p>Baking bread is an important tradition and every Acoma home has an outdoor cooking oven.</p>

<p><a href="http://blog.lesterpickerphoto.com/wp-content/uploads/2011/05/LAP0506.jpg"><img class="size-medium wp-image-1135" title="_LAP0506" src="http://blog.lesterpickerphoto.com/wp-content/uploads/2011/05/LAP0506-199x300.jpg" alt="" width="199" height="300"></a></p>

<p>But, like with any culture, it is the people that hold it together. The Acoma people value storytelling, song and dance to impart their culture to future generations. Here are some child residents of Sky City (taken with permissions).</p>

<p><a href="http://blog.lesterpickerphoto.com/wp-content/uploads/2011/05/LAP0443.jpg"><img class="aligncenter size-medium wp-image-1136" title="_LAP0443" src="http://blog.lesterpickerphoto.com/wp-content/uploads/2011/05/LAP0443-199x300.jpg" alt="" width="199" height="300"></a></p>

		  <div class="entry-content"><p>I was revisiting my images from my New Zealand assignment last Fall and I came across this one. I took this on the second day of a two-day visit to Lake Tekapo, on New Zealand’s South Island. This is the iconic Church of the Good Shepard, which has been photographed every possible which way over the years by tourists, large format photographers, 35mm shooters, probably even pinhole aficionados. And no wonder. The church is situated at the edge of the lake, surrounded by a ring of snow-capped mountains. If there is a prettier church anywhere, please let me know!</p>

<p><a href="http://blog.lesterpickerphoto.com/wp-content/uploads/2011/05/Tekapo-Church.jpg"><img class="aligncenter size-medium wp-image-1125" title="Tekapo Church" src="http://blog.lesterpickerphoto.com/wp-content/uploads/2011/05/Tekapo-Church-300x199.jpg" alt="" width="300" height="199"></a></p>

<p>As I always do before a major assignment, I had developed a list of shots I wanted to take and in Lake Tekapo (pronounced <strong>Tee</strong>’-ka-po) I badly wanted a shot of the church at sunrise. But the weather did not cooperate. It had rained continuously on the first day and when I went out for sunrise, there was none. The day dawned gray, cold and miserable.</p>

<p>To say I was frustrated would be putting it mildly. I mean, I came halfway around the planet and this was to be a go-to shot. To make matters even worse, the wind was blowing at gale force and a major storm was forecast. Now, some of my best images have come when the weather has been atrocious. In fact, I have learned to relish those opportunities, when other photographers pack up to await sunnier times. Not me. I have developed a system that allows me to stick it out as far as possible, often resulting in a winning photo.</p>

<p>In this case, I braced my trusty Gitzo 3541 with Really Right Stuff BH-55b ball-head low to the ground and hung my 30 pound (14 Kg) backpack from the hook under the center plate to stabilize it further (I always carry an assortment of carabiners for that, and other, purposes). I composed the image the way I wanted, placing the Church off-center and emphasizing the threatening clouds. I always use a cable release when shooting landscapes on a tripod, so I stepped to the side and shielded the camera from the wind as well as I could. Then I actually <strong>slowed</strong> down the shutter speed, so I could capture the blowing grasses in the foreground, adding a painterly feeling to the piece.</p>

<p>I like the resulting image, depicting the solidity of the church despite the storm, the angry clouds, the rim of mountains, and the softness of the grasses. Do you agree? Are there elements in the image you would have improved? Please feel free to be candid. I always enjoy another’s perspective.</p>

		  <div class="entry-content"><p>I’m not sure what it is with old, junk cars. As photographers we seem to be drawn to them like flies to…</p>

<p>Okay, let’s start again. I spend a good amount of time in the woods and fields taking photographs and every so often I come across a great old junk car, peacefully rusting away. It’s irresistible. Snap, snap, hmmmn, maybe that angle or this one. Is it a metaphor for our own creaking, degenerating bodies? Is it the triumph of nature over machine? If you actually take the time to sit down and think about it, how on earth can a rusting hunk of junk hold attraction for anyone, let alone a nature/landscape/wildlife photographer?</p>

<p>Here’s a bunch that I’ve taken over the years. Maybe you can explain to me what the attraction is.</p>

<p>This last one really gets me. It&#8217;s an old joke to the natives of Maui, Hawaii. No one has ever been able to explain how this car got to the edge of this cliff. It would have had to drive over impossibly rough terrain and across small ravines to get there. Go figure!</p>

		  <div class="entry-content"><p>Tomorrow I&#8217;m heading out for New Mexico for a week, four days of which I plan to spend trying out my well worn, but new to me 4x5 view camera. Never having used a view camera before, I&#8217;ve been practicing for the past few weeks. I&#8217;m pleased with my progress, even though it is slower than I would like, what with having to send every batch of film to the lab, wait for it to return, compare them to my notes and try again.</p>

<p>My main challenge has been nailing the correct exposures. I hope I&#8217;ve refined the process enough to take advantage of New Mexico&#8217;s beautiful landscapes. We&#8217;ll see.</p>

		  <div class="entry-content"><p>I was reviewing some images this week in preparation for a presentation on my photography, when I came across this image. It sparked a memory that I’d like to share with you.</p>

<p><a href="http://blog.lesterpickerphoto.com/wp-content/uploads/2011/05/CanadianRockies2009-1482009-09-29-1.jpg"><img class="size-medium wp-image-1108" title="CanadianRockies2009 1482009-09-29 (1)" src="http://blog.lesterpickerphoto.com/wp-content/uploads/2011/05/CanadianRockies2009-1482009-09-29-1-300x198.jpg" alt="" width="300" height="198"></a></p>

<div class="mceTemp mceIEcenter"><dl id="attachment_1108" class="wp-caption aligncenter" style="width: 310px;">
<dd class="wp-caption-dd">Banff National Park</dd> </dl></div>


<p>I took this image at approximately an hour after sunset at the end of September in Banff National Park in Canada. (Please click on the image to enlarge it).</p>

<p>The other photographers I was with had packed up their gear at or shortly after sunset. Since it had just snowed and the meadow was so magically covered, I decided to linger and milk the scene for what it was worth. With digital, what did I have to lose?</p>

<p>So, I kept the aperture on my Nikon 17-35 f2.8 zoom at f11, ISO 100, and exposed on my tripod set low to the ground for 30 seconds. That gave an ethereal, blurry look to the clouds, which were moving at a pretty good clip. I also held a slight graduated neutral density filter across the sky portion because it was becoming so dark by then I knew that the foreground would become almost black if I didn’t hold back some of the fading light in the sky.</p>

<p>Now, I’m not saying that this image is going to win any awards, but I really like it and after all, isn’t that what the art of photography is really about? I especially like the clouds and the way the snow covered marsh grasses held the white color. I can still feel the bone chilling cold as I lay on the ground that evening (I had left my heavier jacket in the car), the total silence, and the cool, crisp mountain air.</p>

<p>My point in all this is simply to say that, at times, it pays to never give up. There are times I’ve packed up at a sunset and the sky suddenly flared up and I spewed all manner of expletives at my impatience. So, settle in, relax, enjoy the view. You might just catch that elusive moment.</p>

		  <div class="entry-content"><p>If I had a dollar for every time I hear “Oh, you used a filter for that shot,” I’d be retired now, sipping Marguerites on a Pacific island. Of course, that comment is usually said disparagingly, often with a frown of distaste and typically in front of a woman hanging on to her man’s arm. She, naturally, nods approvingly, blissfully unaware of her husband’s profound ignorance. Happened to me again this week.</p>

<p>Many photographers use filters in ‘artistic’ ways in order to manipulate the scene to craft their unique vision. I may or may not like the specific result, but I always respect their visioning process.</p>

<p>In my work I simply cannot do that. Most magazines require that I shoot a scene as it appears, without enhancements. Yet I still use filters. How’s that?</p>

<p>The human eye is multiple times more sensitive than the finest digital sensors, able to discern light areas from dark, even different shades of dark within landscape shadows. If I were to simply meter on the shadows in the scene, I’d end up with an image in which the sky is what we call ‘overblown,’ meaning that there are no details in the bright areas of the scene. Conversely, if I meter on the brighter portions, the sensor screams ‘Hey, it’s too bright out there, close down the lens opening!’ As a result, the shadows in the scene are rendered so dark there is no detail within them. Trees, for example, will come out as black, featureless silhouettes, which might actually look nice in certain scenes. But frankly, my editors, or those who purchase my images for their homes and offices, would not be pleased if there are massive black areas with no discernible detail.</p>

<p>So, in those cases when I have huge expanses of sky and mountains and forest below, I use a special glass or resin filter known as a Graduated Neutral Density. Here is a photo of what it looks like.</p>

<p><a href="http://blog.lesterpickerphoto.com/wp-content/uploads/2011/05/Unknown.jpeg"><img class="size-full wp-image-1101" title="Unknown" src="http://blog.lesterpickerphoto.com/wp-content/uploads/2011/05/Unknown.jpeg" alt="" width="275" height="183"></a></p>

<p>The filter has a coating that reduces the light reaching certain areas of the sensor, while allowing full light to come through the rest, all without affecting the color of the scene. Pretty nifty, eh?</p>

<p>There are technical explanations for how this happens having to do with reducing the dynamic range of the scene, but it’s the results that matter, so I’ll skip the technical mumbo-jumbo in this blog. What the GND filter means is that my images are usually nicely balanced and I avoid blown out highlights, although sometimes you can’t avoid it no matter what you do. Here are some examples where I’ve used a GND filter, almost always when there is a large expanse of bright sky that I have to tame.</p>

<p><a href="http://blog.lesterpickerphoto.com/wp-content/uploads/2011/05/LAP5080-16x24.jpg"><img class="size-medium wp-image-1102" title="Martyr Bay, Victoria" src="http://blog.lesterpickerphoto.com/wp-content/uploads/2011/05/LAP5080-16x24-207x300.jpg" alt="" width="207" height="300"></a></p>

<p><a href="http://blog.lesterpickerphoto.com/wp-content/uploads/2011/05/CaRockies2009-Route-742-Spray-Lake-Kananaskis-country-7-of-11.jpg"><img class="size-medium wp-image-1103" title="CaRockies2009-Route 742-Spray Lake, Kananaskis country 7 of 11" src="http://blog.lesterpickerphoto.com/wp-content/uploads/2011/05/CaRockies2009-Route-742-Spray-Lake-Kananaskis-country-7-of-11-300x199.jpg" alt="" width="300" height="199"></a></p>

<p>Another filter I use a lot is a simple polarizing filter. This filter works like your polarizing sunglasses, only better. Once you screw in the filter, you just rotate the two pieces of glass as you look through the viewfinder and- voila!- magic happens. Clouds seem to almost pop out of the scene. The sky becomes crisp and clear. Distracting reflections disappear from water scenes and the reflections you want are emphasized.</p>

<p><a href="http://blog.lesterpickerphoto.com/wp-content/uploads/2011/05/Colorado-River-below-Glen-Canyon-Dam-87-of-205.jpg"><img class="size-medium wp-image-1104" title="Colorado River-below Glen Canyon Dam 87 of 205" src="http://blog.lesterpickerphoto.com/wp-content/uploads/2011/05/Colorado-River-below-Glen-Canyon-Dam-87-of-205-200x300.jpg" alt="" width="200" height="300"></a></p>

<p>Those are basically the only filters I use, and they are by no means inexpensive. I always recommend that you get the best filters (and lenses) you can afford, since everything we do in photography is done through glass (or resins). I personally use Singh-Ray (<a href="http://www.singh-ray.com">www.singh-ray.com</a>) and Lee (<a href="http://www.leefilters.com">www.leefilters.com</a>) filters.</p>

<p>Let us know what types of filters you prefer to use and how you put them to use in your photography. In the meantime, happy shooting!</p>

		  <div class="entry-content"><p>I won’t refute charges that I am certifiably nuts, that I’ve finally gone over the precipice. After years of discussion, persuasion, debating and research, I finally bit the bullet and have invested in… drumroll here… Large Format Photography.</p>

<p>Yes, you read it right. I have taken at least three giant steps into the past- beyond digital, beyond 35mm film cameras- and joined the ranks of Matthew Brady and Ansel Adams. I’m now the anxious owner of an Arca Swiss 4x5 view camera, film and all.</p>

<p><a href="http://blog.lesterpickerphoto.com/wp-content/uploads/2011/05/LAP9163.jpg"><img class="aligncenter size-medium wp-image-1092" title="_LAP9163" src="http://blog.lesterpickerphoto.com/wp-content/uploads/2011/05/LAP9163-300x199.jpg" alt="" width="300" height="199"></a></p>

<p><a href="http://blog.lesterpickerphoto.com/wp-content/uploads/2011/05/LAP9164.jpg"><img class="aligncenter size-medium wp-image-1093" title="_LAP9164" src="http://blog.lesterpickerphoto.com/wp-content/uploads/2011/05/LAP9164-199x300.jpg" alt="" width="199" height="300"></a></p>

<p>We’re talking Neanderthal here:  manual focusing, manual setting of shutter speed and aperture, manual cocking of the shutter, manually inserting film into film loaders and then stuffing them into the back of the camera and stripping out the light-blocking shade and then reinserting it after the shutter is tripped.</p>

<p>Frankly, I was planning on tackling large format in 2012, but at the cajoling of my associate, Bob Boyer, I decided to bite the bullet immediately. This is the first in a series of blogs I hope to write over the next couple of years, reporting on my progress, or lack thereof. Bob has been doing my post-processing for the past couple of years, readying my digital images for traditional printing or, as client needs demand, for printing on aluminum, fiberboard or behind plexiglas.</p>

<p>Throughout this time, Bob’s sheer talent has gotten us by. He is able to extract every last pixel from my images so that we can enlarge them to the sizes our clients require, usually 20 x 30 or 24 x 36. But our clients have been clambering for ever larger images and the tipping point came last month when a client needed a 5-foot by 8-foot mural printed on a specialty medium. Bob pulled another rabbit out of his hat and the mural turned out every bit as good as we had hoped.</p>

<p><a href="http://blog.lesterpickerphoto.com/wp-content/uploads/2011/05/P1010202-1.jpg"><img class="size-medium wp-image-1094" title="P1010202-1" src="http://blog.lesterpickerphoto.com/wp-content/uploads/2011/05/P1010202-1-300x168.jpg" alt="" width="300" height="168"></a></p>

<p>The client loves it and restaurant patrons regularly comment on it. One patron said that she specifically brought her friend for lunch just to show her the image.</p>

<p>But, that last mural was the proverbial straw. It took so much effort to stretch the image from its native 12 mega-pixels. Now, depending on how the image is scanned, with that 4x5 transparency I’ll be able to get images with 100 MP, 250MP, 500MP or even 1 gigabit of information! Enlarging those will be a snap. Plus, there are other terrific advantages to shooting with a large format camera, but also some serious drawbacks. I’ll cover those, too, in future blogs.</p>

<p>For now, it’s back to the books, climbing the learning curve with my newest photo tool.</p>

		  <div class="entry-content"><p>My assistant, Bob, and I took a break from the humdrum today and went out to the local state park to try out some metering techniques for my newest piece of equipment; a large format camera.</p>

<p>Me, I was dressed appropriately, being a landscape/wildlife photographer. We were going to a stream, so I wore boots with non-slip soles, rugged shirt and pants, and lots of insect repellent, etc. Bob is a consummate indoor fashion photographer. What does he know from traipsing in the woods? He had come from someplace else and was dressed in a white shirt, nice pants and flip-flops. Flip-flops! I mentioned something to him about it, but…</p>

<p>We walked down the embankment on a well-worn path. I stepped out onto a slippery rock in the stream and Bob was one step behind me when I heard a whoosh, thud, bone crunching on rock and a moan. Bob had slipped on the muddy rock and was down for the count.</p>

<p><a href="http://blog.lesterpickerphoto.com/wp-content/uploads/2011/05/HdG-Fall_2007-11-21_211%C2%A9LesterPicker.jpg"><img class="size-medium wp-image-1087 " title="HdG Fall_2007-11-21_211©LesterPicker" src="http://blog.lesterpickerphoto.com/wp-content/uploads/2011/05/HdG-Fall_2007-11-21_211%C2%A9LesterPicker-212x300.jpg" alt="" width="212" height="300"></a></p>

<p>White shirt no more, pants the color of muck, bloody hand and a big hurt all over his body. Can’t wait to hear how he feels when he gets up in the morning. We have a photo shoot of our most recent photo installation scheduled for tomorrow. We’ll see. I just hope he&#8217;s okay.</p>

<p>I admit to feelings of guilt over this incident. With my outdoor experience I should have warned Bob away from that spot. As the saying goes, foresight is better than hindsight by a darned sight!</p>

<p>Moral of the story: screw fashion, convention, and comfort. If you’re outside photographing and don’t look at least somewhat geeky, you’re not really a serious photographer&#8230; a serious <strong><em>outdoor</em></strong> photographer.  ‘Nuf said.</p>

<hr />

<p><strong>UPDATE</strong>: Bob is fine&#8230; sore and bruised, but he is back to work and as ornery as ever.</p>

We had just viewed some outtakes of the photo session and noticed that many of the images included materials along the edges that we had not wanted to be in the frame.</p>

<p>The issue here is that many viewfinders, that is the scene you see when you look through the eyepiece or the back of your digital screen, does not actually represent what the camera will record on the sensor. In my case, my Nikon D700 that we were using for this shoot has 95% coverage. That means that the actual image the camera produces will include 5% more coverage around the edges than what I saw with my own eyes as I squinted through the eyepiece. Fortunately we noticed this as we shot, since we were tethered to my trusty Apple MacBook Air and could see the images immediately on its crisp 13” screen.</p>

<p>In this first image, we noticed the white photo ID placard to the left of my wall-mounted images, good for marketing my work to patrons, but bad for a PR brochure shot.</p>

<p><a href="http://blog.lesterpickerphoto.com/wp-content/uploads/2011/05/LAP8976.jpg"><img class="aligncenter size-medium wp-image-1079" title="_LAP8976" src="http://blog.lesterpickerphoto.com/wp-content/uploads/2011/05/LAP8976-300x199.jpg" alt="" width="300" height="199"></a></p>

<p>In this next shot I cropped in-camera to remove that distraction.</p>

<p><a href="http://blog.lesterpickerphoto.com/wp-content/uploads/2011/05/LAP8982.jpg"><img class="aligncenter size-medium wp-image-1080" title="_LAP8982" src="http://blog.lesterpickerphoto.com/wp-content/uploads/2011/05/LAP8982-300x199.jpg" alt="" width="300" height="199"></a></p>

<p>However, this viewfinder issue can be a real problem in some situations, as unwanted distractions pop up in the final image. Okay, you may say, that’s no big deal, I can just crop the image and remove the distractions if you do your own post-processing. That’s often true. But don’t forget that most digital SLRs have a 2:3 format or perhaps a 4:3 format, known as the aspect ratio, meaning that the image size is longer than wide. That means that you can’t crop equally on all sides, which may affect your composition.</p>

<p>With some digital point-and-shoot cameras you can change the aspect ratio. The Canon G12, for example, can be changed from its native 4:3 ratio to 3:2 or others. But it famously has 100% viewfinder coverage, so what you see is what you get.</p>

<p>My point here is that you should always check out your owner’s manual to see what your viewfinder coverage is. Take some test shots, too. At very close range 5% missing coverage may not mean a lot, but in a landscape scene it might include a good deal of unplanned detail that can ruin a shot.</p>

<p>Happy shooting!</p>

		  <div class="entry-content"><p>Life is a rich stew of pain, pleasures, new discoveries and chance meetings. I’m waxing philosophical here because of my Internet friendship with James Winters, a professional musician and amateur photographer, who comments frequently here on my blog site. I’ve written about James’ heart-felt photography before (<a href="http://blog.lesterpickerphoto.com/2011/03/31/an-eye-for-photography/">http://blog.lesterpickerphoto.com/2011/03/31/an-eye-for-photography/</a>).</p>

<p>In a recent post on the Nikonians website, Jim credited me and another photographer with inspiring him to think more seriously about his gift. Sure enough, a day later this other photographer sent me a blog comment and so, curiously, I visited his website to check him out.</p>

<p>Wow! Was all I could say for the first ten minutes or so, as my eyes and brain were treated to some of the most evocative images I have ever seen. This young man (well, young to me, anyway) has that rare combination of a good eye… no, a great eye and the technical skills to match.</p>

<p>His name is Daniel Stainer and he lives in western Pennsylvania near some outstanding natural areas that he brings to life in his images. I’m not sure which of his images I like more, his black and whites or color, nature or people, because all are spectacular. He is a semi-pro shooter who is, quite frankly, in my opinion, wasting his time doing anything else but devoting himself full-time to helping the rest of us see the world through his acute and sensitive eyes. Then again, I know full well the need to provide for a family (he is married and co-raising 3 children). But I also know the pain of not being able to do what you love when the muse visits. So, I want to also acknowledge Daniel’s sacrifice for those he loves.</p>

<p><a href="http://blog.lesterpickerphoto.com/wp-content/uploads/2011/04/5280375315_6c18a6fa6a.jpg"><img class="aligncenter size-medium wp-image-1076" title="5280375315_6c18a6fa6a" src="http://blog.lesterpickerphoto.com/wp-content/uploads/2011/04/5280375315_6c18a6fa6a-300x300.jpg" alt="" width="300" height="300"></a></p>

<p>Please treat yourself to a visit to Daniel’s site (<a href="http://www.danielstainer.com/">http://www.danielstainer.com/</a>) and see if you agree with me. As always, I welcome your comments here.</p>

		  <div class="entry-content"><p>I am incredibly honored to have been named to the faculty of the prestigious Nikonians Academy (<a href="http://www.nikoniansacademy.com/viewFacultyPage.html?page_id=7">http://www.nikoniansacademy.com/viewFacultyPage.html?page_id=7</a>). Nikonians is the world&#8217;s largest organization of Nikon devotees. It is a wealth of information on anything Nikon&#8230; and more. Their forums are chock full of useful information about photography in general and I often contribute to them as my schedule permits. It&#8217;s also my go-to resource when I have a technical question.</p>

<p><a href="http://blog.lesterpickerphoto.com/wp-content/uploads/2011/04/LesPicker_284px.jpg"><img class="aligncenter size-medium wp-image-1065" title="LesPicker_284px" src="http://blog.lesterpickerphoto.com/wp-content/uploads/2011/04/LesPicker_284px-217x300.jpg" alt="" width="217" height="300"></a></p>

<p>As a faculty-member, I will be offering workshops in the field for accomplished and aspiring photographers. The wonderful thing about Nikonians workshops is that we accommodate all skill levels and all cameras. You do not have to own a Nikon to come along. Each workshop is designed with the photographer in mind. We do all the planning and preliminary work; you show up and enjoy the best photo locations, good food, and excellent instruction. There&#8217;s simply no better way to learn new skills and improve existing ones than with the one-on-one a small group workshop provides.</p>

<p>Check out Nikonians (<a href="www.nikonians.org">www.nikonians.org</a>) and after you are wowed by all it offers, check out my first workshop, which will be held this summer in the pristine Yukon wilderness of Canada. Want to photograph bears? We got &#8216;em! Caribou, elk, fox, wolves, beaver? Done! Spectacular landscapes? Join me this summer from August 27 to September 3. Here is the workshop description: <a href="http://www.nikoniansacademy.com/nikon-Yukon%2B-%2BCanada%27s%2BUntamed%2BWilderness-workshop/96">http://www.nikoniansacademy.com/nikon-Yukon%2B-%2BCanada%27s%2BUntamed%2BWilderness-workshop/96</a>. I&#8217;d love to see you there!</p>

<p>If you&#8217;d like to see examples of Yukon landscapes and wildlife, check out my Yukon gallery: <a href="http://www.lesterpickerphoto.com/gallery.php?gallery=yukon">http://www.lesterpickerphoto.com/gallery.php?gallery=yukon</a>.</p>

		  <div class="entry-content"><p>It’s now official. After months of planning, I will be offering a photography workshop for the Nikonians Academy in the Yukon, a place I love dearly. The course will run from August 27<sup>th</sup> to September 4<sup>th</sup>, the absolutely most spectacular time of the year to be in Canada’s famed Yukon Territory.</p>

<p><a href="http://www.nikoniansacademy.com/all/viewWorkshop.html?course_id=838">http://www.nikoniansacademy.com/all/viewWorkshop.html?course_id=838</a></p>

<p><a href="http://blog.lesterpickerphoto.com/wp-content/uploads/2011/04/Terry-photo-installation.jpg"><img class="size-medium wp-image-1056" title="Terry photo installation" src="http://blog.lesterpickerphoto.com/wp-content/uploads/2011/04/Terry-photo-installation-300x199.jpg" alt="" width="300" height="199"></a></p>

<p>Late August is the drop-dead gorgeous Fall season in Yukon. We will begin our journey in Whitehorse, where the Yukon’s only international airport is located. After an orientation session we drive by commercial vans to Dawson City, site of the famous Klondike Gold Rush. This historic town is a photographer’s dream, with gravel streets, wood sidewalks and historical structures in various states of repair. The indigenous First Nations culture is alive and well here, too.</p>

<p>While in the Dawson region, we will have numerous opportunities to photograph the Northern Lights, an amazing spectacle that everyone must see sometime in their life. While in Dawson we will travel the scenic Top of the World Highway to Alaska, photographing the landscape and an abandoned gold mine town.</p>

<p><a href="http://blog.lesterpickerphoto.com/wp-content/uploads/2011/04/northernlights1.jpg"><img class="size-medium wp-image-1057" title="northernlights1" src="http://blog.lesterpickerphoto.com/wp-content/uploads/2011/04/northernlights1-199x300.jpg" alt="" width="199" height="300"></a></p>

<p>Next we travel up the storied Dempster Highway to the Arctic Circle, where we should have many opportunities to photograph grizzly bears, moose, foxes, beavers, caribou, eagles and other wildlife. The scenery changes markedly from forest to tundra as we head north to the Arctic Circle. Most incredible is the change of color as Fall transforms the tundra into flaming reds, oranges and earth-tones. There is nothing else like it, a place few people get to visit, let alone photograph with two professional guides. Since we are so far north, daylight lasts until 11 PM. What more can a photographer ask for?</p>

<p><a href="http://blog.lesterpickerphoto.com/wp-content/uploads/2011/04/DEmpster.jpeg"><img class="size-medium wp-image-1058" title="Dempster Hwy view from YT/NWT border," src="http://blog.lesterpickerphoto.com/wp-content/uploads/2011/04/DEmpster-224x300.jpg" alt="" width="224" height="300"></a></p>

<p>I say two guides because I will be accompanied by my co-instructor Richard Hartmier (<a href="http://www.hartmier.com">www.hartmier.com</a>) a Yukon resident and photographer par excellence. Richard is a storehouse of knowledge about the Yukon environment, knows hidden photography spots that a casual visitor would never discover, and is an excellent instructor.</p>

<p><a href="http://blog.lesterpickerphoto.com/wp-content/uploads/2011/04/Maine-2009-Longpond-hdr-2.jpg"><img class="size-medium wp-image-1059" title="Maine 2009-Longpond-hdr (2)" src="http://blog.lesterpickerphoto.com/wp-content/uploads/2011/04/Maine-2009-Longpond-hdr-2-300x200.jpg" alt="" width="300" height="200"></a></p>

<p>As we retrace our steps to get back to Whitehorse, the Fall landscapes will have changed dramatically and we’ll stop and shoot our way back during sunrises, sunsets and nighttime Aurora excursions.</p>

<p>When you first arrive in Whitehorse, you will not have ot take out your wallet again (except for alcoholic beverages). All food, transportation, even sunscreen and insect repellant, are included. We want you to focus exclusively on photography.</p>

<p>Nikonians workshops are for all levels of photographic skills. Here you’ll have a chance to learn new techniques, refine existing techniques, or just plain snap some images on your point-and-shoot. The workshop is limited to 14 people, so everyone has plenty of instructional time, as needed. Nikonians workshops are fun, with lots of information sharing throughout.</p>

<p>For the full itinerary, fees, and other travel information, please go to:</p>

<p>Oh, did I mention grizzlies?</p>

<p><a href="http://blog.lesterpickerphoto.com/wp-content/uploads/2011/04/Maine-2009-Longpond-hdr.jpg"><img class="size-medium wp-image-1060" title="Maine 2009-Longpond-hdr" src="http://blog.lesterpickerphoto.com/wp-content/uploads/2011/04/Maine-2009-Longpond-hdr-300x198.jpg" alt="" width="300" height="198"></a></p>

<p>I hope to see some of you there!</p>

		  <div class="entry-content"><p>Every so often an amateur photographer will write to me with comments on my images or to ask for advice. I enjoy both, even if the comments are negative, because I like to understand what about my images turn people on or off.</p>

<p>In most cases, if my reader includes a website or Flickr account, I check it out. I invariably enjoy the images, which give me insights into the person, his or her likes and dislikes, and their eye for photography. It’s one of the more enjoyable aspects of what I do.</p>

<p>Once in a while I am impressed by a reader’s images and have blogged about that individual’s work. But once in a very, very great while a reader’s images will, quite simply, blow me away.</p>

<p>That was the case a few months back when James Winters commented on my work. We corresponded back and forth for a while and I came to find out that James lives in a geodesic dome in Maine that I actually visited a few times as a starving doctoral student when it was being built by one of my friends back in 1976! How’s that for synchronicity, or whatever you’d call it?</p>

<p>In any event, Jim is fairly new to DSLR photography, but he managed to pick up a Nikon with a couple of lenses. Many of Jim’s images are solidly good, but fairly ordinary, as he is learning to master his hobby. Frankly, a small percentage of his images I would have culled if they were my albums. But then there are images on his site— lots of them— that are so wonderful they grab at your heart. I’ve asked Jim for permission to write about him and to highlight a sampling of his images to show you how they affect me.</p>

<p>First, the gestalt; the cumulative effect of Jim’s work is to show how much family means to him. His shots of people, kids in particular, are fresh, candid and full of life’s magic moments. With eleven (!) children, a wife and tons of friends, Jim has ample subject matter, to be sure. But it’s the joys and disappointments that he captures in everyday moments that makes his work stand apart. If you spend time in his world, and there is abundant opportunity with thousands of images, you gain a sense of his children’s personalities, some impish, some quiet and restrained. You also get a glimpse into the frenetic, loving and creative home that Jim and his wife, Laura, have crafted.</p>

<p><a href="http://blog.lesterpickerphoto.com/wp-content/uploads/2011/03/393073290_z8FX2-L.jpg"><img class="aligncenter size-medium wp-image-1041" title="393073290_z8FX2-L" src="http://blog.lesterpickerphoto.com/wp-content/uploads/2011/03/393073290_z8FX2-L-300x225.jpg" alt="" width="300" height="225"></a></p>

<p>I thought I would comment on each image, relating what I like about each. But as I thought on it, I believe the  best way to go is to just post a bunch of Jim&#8217;s images and let YOU, my readers, comment first. Then I&#8217;ll chime in with my responses. As always, click on an image to enlarge it.</p>

<p><a href="http://blog.lesterpickerphoto.com/wp-content/uploads/2011/03/364448900_Hvvbe-L.jpg"><img class="aligncenter size-medium wp-image-1042" title="364448900_Hvvbe-L" src="http://blog.lesterpickerphoto.com/wp-content/uploads/2011/03/364448900_Hvvbe-L-300x225.jpg" alt="" width="300" height="225"></a></p>

<p>This next one, though, I can&#8217;t refrain from commenting on. To me, this is simply an amazing image. Is it the blur of the boy active on the swing? The girl standing and watching, wearing a &#8220;traditional&#8221; dress. The expression on the face of the girl? But above all, I see a story here, a yearning on my part to know what is going on. Who are they? What is the girl thinking? What is the setting? And that&#8217;s the beauty of photography; it is at its best when it tells a story.</p>

<p><a href="http://blog.lesterpickerphoto.com/wp-content/uploads/2011/03/390717702_z6PFV-L.jpg"><img class="aligncenter size-medium wp-image-1045" title="390717702_z6PFV-L" src="http://blog.lesterpickerphoto.com/wp-content/uploads/2011/03/390717702_z6PFV-L-300x225.jpg" alt="" width="300" height="225"></a></p>

<p>When you have the chance, go to: <a href="http://vielle.smugmug.com/Family/the-main-folder/5475774_MtSEg#1205479117_Nyg5L">http://vielle.smugmug.com/Family/the-main-folder/5475774_MtSEg#1205479117_Nyg5L</a> and randomly go through his work. If nothing else, Jim’s body of work shows me that one doesn’t have to be a pro to get meaningful, dramatic results, even from life&#8217;s everyday moments. Jim does what he does in photography simply for the joy of capturing those special family moments and sharing them with his extended network of friends and family. For that, we are all grateful.</p>

		  <div class="entry-content"><p>A few months ago, I was asked to be the exclusive artist for a wonderful new upscale restaurant opening in the county in which I live. I was honored to have been asked and after I agreed to do it the reality of the situation hit me. Here it was, literally weeks from opening, and I had to design the installation, choose the images, get them printed and install them before the grand opening, and that was on top of my other assignments. Stress city, here I come!</p>

<p>Now we’re just a week away from the Grand Opening and I thought you might want to see what has gone into the production from the photographer’s viewpoint.</p>

<h3>Hats off to Bob</h3>


<p>First, I’ve got to say that none of this would have been possible— well possible, but not as expertly done— without the able assistance of Bob Boyer. Bob and I have been working together for a couple of years now and we have entire sets of non-overlapping skills. Bob is a computer expert (<a href="http://photo.rwboyer.com">http://photo.rwboyer.com</a>), while I know nothing about what goes on inside the black box. Bob is a studio photographer and indoor lighting expert, while I would much rather be outdoors, shooting landscapes in minus-30F or plus-110F. Thankfully, Bob is also a printing maven, a true master of the craft, a digital Ansel Adams, if you will (or Edward Westin, who he prefers).</p>

<h3>Carsins&#8217;: The Restaurant</h3>


<p>Carsins’—that’s the name of the restaurant… and yes, the apostrophe is in the right place— is the brainchild of Terry Cheung, an experienced and successful restaurateur. It will open as a steak and seafood establishment, although Terry plans to add sushi to the fare a few months after opening. It occupies a large footprint and so our selection of images was governed both by size and the unique wall surfaces throughout. In the end we settled on 22 images, some individual and others in geographic or thematic groupings, such as Canadian scenics or wildlife images.</p>

<p>We also wanted to highlight for customers, many of whom will be corporate executives, what our capabilities are for potential displays in their offices or building lobbies. So, we chose several display media, most notably ColorPlak, aluminum, face-mounted plexiglass (FMP) and traditional matted and framed prints.</p>

<p>Once the images were selected from my Aperture files, we assembled them using the lightbox feature within Aperture and began to arrange them in individual spaces or in pleasing wall groupings. Once I was done with that I handed the images over to Bob to work his magic.</p>

<h3>Printing Challenges</h3>


<p>Anyone who knows anything about printing images knows that every paper type prints slightly differently. To get the best print possible, you’d better know how each paper handles contrast and tonality, for example. Now, multiply that knowledge several times to understand how different <strong><em>media</em></strong> affect print quality. ColorPlak, for example, handles contrast wholly differently than FMP, so Bob had to incorporate those differences for every image, paper and medium.</p>

<p>Finally, the images began to be delivered to us, in the case of ColorPlak, freighted across the country to us from California. For the black and white images, we did our own printing and only had to pick them up from the framing shop.</p>

<h3>The Installation Starts</h3>


<p>Here I am installing one array of images on a dining room wall (just click on each image to enlarge). We do all the installations ourselves so as to get the exact look we want. Sure it takes me away from photographing, but it’s all part of artistic expression, so I enjoy that hands-on part of my artwork.</p>

<p><a href="http://blog.lesterpickerphoto.com/wp-content/uploads/2011/03/P1010178.jpg"><img class="size-medium wp-image-1031" title="P1010178" src="http://blog.lesterpickerphoto.com/wp-content/uploads/2011/03/P1010178-300x168.jpg" alt="" width="300" height="168"></a></p>

<p>The biggest challenge we faced was choosing and mounting one iconic image that would serve as the visual focal point for those entering the main dining room. After many visits to the unfinished space and some rousing debates, we finally took a big gamble and settled on an image I took while in the Yukon Territory and Northwest Territory of Canada two years ago. One day a storm approached us as I was photographing. My wife wanted to leave as the wind began to blow fiercely and the temperatures dropped precipitously. I persuaded her to stay for a few minutes more. I weighted down my tripod and took this image, one of my favorites.</p>

<p><a href="http://blog.lesterpickerphoto.com/wp-content/uploads/2011/03/Yukon2009-Dempster-Highway-1782009-09-05.jpg"><img class="size-medium wp-image-1034" title="Yukon2009-Dempster Highway 1782009-09-05" src="http://blog.lesterpickerphoto.com/wp-content/uploads/2011/03/Yukon2009-Dempster-Highway-1782009-09-05-300x199.jpg" alt="" width="300" height="199"></a></p>

<p>The challenge for Bob was to blow that 12-megapixel image up to 5 feet by 9 feet!!! That he was able to do so is a testament to his expertise. We decided to do it as a triptych, which we felt would add some dynamism to the look. We sent the file to ColorPlak (<a href="http://www.colorplak.com">www.colorplak.com</a>) and, as usual, they did a phenomenal job on it.</p>

		  <div class="entry-content"><p>It’s the age-old debate among photographers: gloves vs. mittens. Which are best for the serious photographer, amateur or pro?</p>

<p>For most photographers, the choice is a matter of preference, since the overwhelming majority of enthusiasts shoot in warm or mildly cold temperatures. In those cases you can get away with a light glove, like the excellent wool gloves made by Lowepro that sport rubberized palms and fingers that give the photographer a good grip. I own a pair that I use through the Fall shooting season.</p>

<p><a href="http://blog.lesterpickerphoto.com/wp-content/uploads/2011/03/31948.jpg"><img class="aligncenter size-medium wp-image-1023" title="31948" src="http://blog.lesterpickerphoto.com/wp-content/uploads/2011/03/31948-300x300.jpg" alt="" width="300" height="300"></a></p>

<p>Many photographers I know prefer mittens, simply slipping them off when it comes time to shoot. But, what about seriously cold weather? What does a photographer do in sustained conditions of -25F? I had an opportunity to test this out on my recent photo expedition to Canada’s striking Yukon Territory, where cold is… well, very, very cold.</p>

<p>Having had frostbitten fingers on more than one occasion in my youth living in Maine, I’m susceptible to repeat experiences, so I’m unusually careful with my hand wear in winter. I also have a doctorate in winter ecology, meaning that I love being outdoors when the temps drop, so go figure. I have tried every conceivable glove on the market; Gore-tex, insulated, down-filled, fat, skinny, natural, synthetic, 5-finger and 3-finger hybrids. I’ve also tried every mitten imaginable.</p>

<p>What works for me when I’m photographing in severe cold is this: a thin glove under an insulated mitten. That way I can slip off the mitten once I’m ready to shoot and replace it once the deed is done. The problem has always been what to do with the mitten. I’ve tried clipping it to my sleeve (cumbersome), tying it to the other mitten under my jacket (okay, but not great in Arctic conditions) or just taking 4 pairs with me so that as I lose them I just replace them (very costly and definitely not recommended). Finally, I think I have the perfect solution for my needs.</p>

<p>This was my setup on my latest trip: a layer of very thin Seirus Hyperlite All-Weather gloves- purchased from REI- underneath a pair of mittens made by Swany America (<a href="http://www.swamyamerica.com">www.swanyamerica.com</a>). Be forewarned that the Seirus Hyperlites will not last more than a season under regular photographic use. All the wheels and buttons we use tend to eventually shred the forefinger material.</p>

<p>The Swany mittens are another matter entirely in terms of durability. They offer a line of mittens known as the Toaster collection, available in both men and women models. What makes the Toaster mittens unique is they have a water-sealed zipper along the side of the mitten, allowing you to unzip, poke your hand through, take care of your camera controls and make the shot, then withdraw into the comfort and warmth of the mitten.</p>

<p><a href="http://blog.lesterpickerphoto.com/wp-content/uploads/2011/03/9b2cf93bfff2569b7ac52c48448a73611.jpg"><img class="size-full wp-image-1025" title="9b2cf93bfff2569b7ac52c48448a7361" src="http://blog.lesterpickerphoto.com/wp-content/uploads/2011/03/9b2cf93bfff2569b7ac52c48448a73611.jpg" alt="" width="136" height="250"></a></p>

<p>The Swany mittens are ruggedly constructed, with attention to detail that reflects the ethic of this upstate New York company (the gloves are manufactured in China).</p>

<p>I used the Seirus-Swany pairing throughout my Yukon assignment, including dog mushing. On two nights I was out for up to five hours at a time photographing the Northern Lights (<a href="http://blog.lesterpickerphoto.com/2011/02/15/how-to-photograph-the-northern-lights/">http://blog.lesterpickerphoto.com/2011/02/15/how-to-photograph-the-northern-lights/</a>), with  minus 25F temperatures and a slight wind blowing, making it around -30F. The combo worked well for me, although there are some drawbacks that I need to advise you of if you will be facing that kind of cold.</p>

<p><a href="http://blog.lesterpickerphoto.com/wp-content/uploads/2011/03/swany-mitten-1-of-1.jpg"><img class="size-medium wp-image-1026" title="swany mitten 1 of 1" src="http://blog.lesterpickerphoto.com/wp-content/uploads/2011/03/swany-mitten-1-of-1-300x225.jpg" alt="" width="300" height="225"></a></p>

<p>First, the good news. The zippers on the Swany mittens allowed me to remove my hand as needed, then slip my fingers back into the mitten to rewarm between shots. The mitten fabrics- there are two varieties available, synthetic and leather- are highly flexible, so they give you a good grip on the camera. Even the synthetic model has a leather palm pad to give you a better grip. Each mitten also sports a terrific fleece snow cuff, which can be drawn tight with their uni-pull mechanism. There is also a customizable quick-release strap on the  back of the hand.</p>

<p>As I mentioned, I’m particularly susceptible to frostbite in my dominant right hand, the one I use for all my camera controls. I found I needed to add a hand-warmer (<a href="http://www.littlehottieswarmers.com">www.littlehottieswarmers.com</a>) to each mitten after I’d been out for an hour, just standing around, waiting for the skies to light up. I buy these hand-warmers by the box at Costco. They are environmentally safe, inexpensive and work like a charm.</p>

<p>If you haven’t experienced the biting cold of -25F or below, suffice it to say it is brutal and unforgiving. You’ve got to be fully prepared. These mittens are not the most insulated in Swany’s line, but they are a great compromise for photography <strong><em>IF</em></strong> used with the hand warmers.</p>

<p>The second caution I would offer is that the zippers on the Swany mittens can be difficult to grip and close while wearing the other mitten in extreme cold. Swany needs to attend to that by perhaps enlarging the zipper or making it more grippable. By the end of my trip, however, I managed to develop a routine that worked for me. Also, remember that a mitten works best if it is not too tight. The air space helps insulate, and you’ll need a little room to allow for the hand warmer, which are pretty slim.</p>

<p>If you want to try the Seirus-Swany solution I developed, you’ll need to choose the Swany Toaster Arctic (TS-16) model. It is strictly a shell-type mitten. The all-leather Toaster Legend II (TS-20) has a built in thin polyester liner glove sewn into the glove, making it impossible to use with the Seirus liner. That would be all well and good if the Swany built-in liner worked for photography. But the liner that comes sewn into the Swany Legend II does not have finger grips, making it difficult to use for controlling the camera wheels and buttons in extreme cold.</p>

<p>All in all, the Swany-Seirus combo worked well for me and I plan to use it in the future. I do think I now have a workable solution for my cold weather jaunts.</p>

		  <div class="entry-content"><p>Don’t say I didn’t warn you!  If you’re shooting landscapes, one of the most effective means of adding interest and impact is to include a foreground element. I know we hear this a lot nowadays, but what I find is that this is usually mentioned as a given, an aside, without providing enough detail for the photographer looking to improve his or her skills. I’m hoping to add flesh to the bones here, so please bear with me.</p>

<p>I believe it was George Lepp who said that there is no such thing as a bad day for a nature (landscape) photographer. After all, even if conditions are miserable, we are out there enjoying beautiful, natural environments. Many is the time I’ve hiked down from a mountain with nary a shot, humbled, and glowing with the feeling of divine grace. So, it’s easy to lose sight of what makes a good image great when faced with that scenic beauty on a lovely day. It’s tempting to just slap on a wide angle lens, screw on a polarizer and snap away. Yes, chances are it will be a lovely shot, but is it the very best image we can create for ourselves or for those who will view our work?</p>

<p>As you study my images that I use as examples in this blog, try to analyze how the foreground elements help (or not) the overall presentation. Most of the time I’m guilty of not shooting comparison images for instructional purposes and I’m guilty of that here. I’ll try to do better on that score this year, but I hope you’ll still understand the basic principles shown by the images in this blog. <strong><em>Remember to click on each image to enlarge it.</em></strong></p>

<h3>How Foreground Helps</h3>


<p>Foreground helps bring scale and perspective to a scene. It can functionally help by drawing the viewer’s eye into a scene. It can create visual interest by adding texture, an interesting form, or a looming presence. It can even add cognitive dissonance by forcing the viewer to confront paradoxes in perception; viewers may not like the image, but they sure as heck will remember it! In the above scene, I lowered my reference point in an attempt to use the foreground to draw the viewer&#8217;s eyes to the ocean and sky. Similarly with the image below. I stood in the stream and lowered my vantage point to make the rock loom large and point the viewer&#8217;s eyes to the waterfall.</p>

<p><a href="http://blog.lesterpickerphoto.com/wp-content/uploads/2011/03/w-maui-hikers1-Version-2-Version-2.jpg"><img class="size-medium wp-image-999" title="Falling Branch" src="http://blog.lesterpickerphoto.com/wp-content/uploads/2011/03/w-maui-hikers1-Version-2-Version-2-200x300.jpg" alt="" width="200" height="300"></a></p>

<h3>Composing With Foreground Elements</h3>


<p>The first thing with using strong foreground elements is to decide on its placement compositionally. In most cases I find that setting the foreground object(s) off center helps. You want the viewer’s eye to move from foreground to background and if the foreground element is smack-dab in the middle of the frame it can act as a barrier, hindering the eye’s movement through the frame. Placing it ⅓ of the way (remember the Rule of Thirds) into the frame will lead the viewer’s eyes naturally into the background. Here I used the highlights in the seaweed to allow the eye to roam from there to the sky and toward the silhouetted rock on the right.</p>

<p><a href="http://blog.lesterpickerphoto.com/wp-content/uploads/2011/03/Great-Ocean-Road-Victoria-Australia-3372010-11-11-Version-2.jpg"><img class="size-medium wp-image-1000" title="Martyr Bay, Victoria" src="http://blog.lesterpickerphoto.com/wp-content/uploads/2011/03/Great-Ocean-Road-Victoria-Australia-3372010-11-11-Version-2-300x199.jpg" alt="" width="300" height="199"></a></p>

<p>In the next scene, I used a stronger foreground to both anchor the image at the bottom, but also to frame it on the left so that the viewer is lead to the ocean and sunrise sky on the right, as well as the small tide pool that so nicely reflects the sky.</p>

<p><a href="http://blog.lesterpickerphoto.com/wp-content/uploads/2011/03/Great-Ocean-Road-Victoria-Australia-1152010-11-09.jpg"><img class="size-medium wp-image-1001" title="Great Ocean Road, Victoria, Australia 1152010-11-09" src="http://blog.lesterpickerphoto.com/wp-content/uploads/2011/03/Great-Ocean-Road-Victoria-Australia-1152010-11-09-199x300.jpg" alt="" width="199" height="300"></a></p>

<p>This Hawaiian scene was just &#8216;okay,&#8217; but the tree alone against the ocean just didn&#8217;t do it for me. When I backed up, I saw this small rock thrown into deep shadow and I knew I wanted it as a foreground element.</p>

<p><a href="http://blog.lesterpickerphoto.com/wp-content/uploads/2011/03/West-Maui-Mountains-554.jpg"><img class="size-medium wp-image-1004" title="West Maui 554" src="http://blog.lesterpickerphoto.com/wp-content/uploads/2011/03/West-Maui-Mountains-554-199x300.jpg" alt="" width="199" height="300"></a></p>

<h3>Depth of Field Considerations</h3>


<p>Next you need to make a decision on how ‘focal’ the foreground will be in the overall scene. By that I mean, you need to decide on depth of field (DOF). Do you want to throw the background into soft focus, or do you want to have foreground and background all in sharp focus? This question raises the most difficult series of technical challenges to the photographer and here’s why.</p>

<p>For most of my landscapes, I like to have sharp focus throughout the scene, front to back, side to side. That’s just my general preference, although I will alter that for special scenes. To get that front-to-back focus, using a wide-angle lens, I would need to use an aperture opening of f16 or f22, and even then some of the scenes I shoot would not have tack sharp focus in the far background. A lens can only give you so much DOF.</p>

<p>Another challenge I sometimes face with foreground-background focus is that when using f16 or f22 the image displays a decrease of sharpness, or what pros call “softness” in the image. Each lens has an aperture that is optimum, for my lenses usually f11. Anything more than that, while I may gain DOF, I also lose sharpness. Most people would hardly notice, but a sharp-eyed editor will.</p>

<h3>The Foreground Big Gun</h3>


<p>I solve both these problems by using a specialized lens known as a tilt-shift lens or a perspective correcting lens. I’ll discuss those lenses in more depth in a later blog. Suffice it to say that tilt-shift lenses have the ability to shift the plane of focus and make both near and far objects sharp.</p>

<div>

<a href="http://blog.lesterpickerphoto.com/wp-content/uploads/2011/03/353_2168_PCE_NIKKOR24mm_f3.5DED_sidetilt.png"><img class="size-medium wp-image-1013 " title="353_2168_PCE_NIKKOR24mm_f3.5DED_sidetilt" src="http://blog.lesterpickerphoto.com/wp-content/uploads/2011/03/353_2168_PCE_NIKKOR24mm_f3.5DED_sidetilt-300x254.png" alt="" width="300" height="254"></a>

</div>


<p>The end result is that I’m able to get a landscape image that is to my liking.I used a tilt-shift in this black &amp; white image to capture everything in focus from foreground to background.</p>

<p><a href="http://blog.lesterpickerphoto.com/wp-content/uploads/2011/03/CaRockies2009-Route-742-Spray-Lake-Kananaskis-country-7-of-11.jpg"><img class="size-medium wp-image-1005" title="CaRockies2009-Route 742-Spray Lake, Kananaskis country 7 of 11" src="http://blog.lesterpickerphoto.com/wp-content/uploads/2011/03/CaRockies2009-Route-742-Spray-Lake-Kananaskis-country-7-of-11-300x199.jpg" alt="" width="300" height="199"></a></p>

<h3>Foreground Works With People, Too</h3>


<p>Don&#8217;t forget that foreground elements work when photographing people, too, as this next image shows. I wanted this image to portray this Ecuadorean woman in the context of her livelihood and culture. The bananas in the foreground make the visual statement I was looking for, but it is the woman&#8217;s facial expression that does it for me.</p>

<p><a href="http://blog.lesterpickerphoto.com/wp-content/uploads/2011/03/ecuadorbananalady.jpg"><img class="size-medium wp-image-1010" title="ecuadorbananalady" src="http://blog.lesterpickerphoto.com/wp-content/uploads/2011/03/ecuadorbananalady-201x300.jpg" alt="" width="201" height="300"></a></p>

<h3>Use a Tripod</h3>


<p>Whatever equipment you use, a regular lens or a tilt-shift, to properly use foreground elements, you really need to use a tripod. I explain this in detail in another blog (<a href="http://blog.lesterpickerphoto.com/2010/12/15/tripod-or-lens/">http://blog.lesterpickerphoto.com/2010/12/15/tripod-or-lens/</a>). When you think of it seriously, you can understand my rationale. To include strong foreground elements you have to compose the scene properly, critically focus on the foreground object(s) and then stop down (reduce the aperture opening of) your lens. Reducing the aperture means you have to increase the exposure time. Now, try doing all that while hand-holding a camera! The blurry results will make all your efforts wasted.</p>

<p>Then again, there are times when it all comes together for the photographer, as happened to me on this sunset in Kahana, Maui, Hawaii. I had come back to this same spot four sunsets in a row until I finally got this scene. The sunset alone would have been lovely, as attested to by perhaps a dozen or more tourists who were on the sandy beach to the right of where I took this image. They probably thought I was nuts, climbing down from a parking area to these rocks to set up my tripod. I set my camera for a long, 20-second exposure, allowing the ebb and flow of the tide to soften the water. But I truly feel it is the rocks in the foreground that make the shot. For me, anyway, it was a perfect night.</p>

<p><a href="http://blog.lesterpickerphoto.com/wp-content/uploads/2011/03/West-Maui-Mountains-575.jpg"><img class="size-medium wp-image-1006" title="Maui 575" src="http://blog.lesterpickerphoto.com/wp-content/uploads/2011/03/West-Maui-Mountains-575-199x300.jpg" alt="" width="199" height="300"></a></p>

<p>One of my favorite photographers using strong foreground elements is the noted Canadian landscape photographer Darwin Wiggett. Take a gander at how he uses foreground elements to anchor his landscapes and you’ll understand how a master photographer works. Try this one: <a href="http://www.darwinwiggett.com/photo.php?id=663&amp;gallery=winter">http://www.darwinwiggett.com/photo.php?id=663&amp;gallery=winter</a> or this one: <a href="http://www.darwinwiggett.com/photo.php?id=662&amp;gallery=winter">http://www.darwinwiggett.com/photo.php?id=662&amp;gallery=winter</a> for starters.</p>

<p>By all means include strong foreground elements in your images, but be forewarned. Arrive prepared and it will make the job far easier and much more rewarding.</p>

<p>Rather than do a second post on Dawson City, Yukon- as wild and whacky and wonderful a town as you&#8217;ll ever see- I decided to reduce confusion and add details on places of interest, hotels and restaurants to the original blog. Here&#8217;s the link:</p>

		  <div class="entry-content"><p>Once photographers find out that I travel to the Yukon and Arctic Circle, I’m invariably asked about photographing the Northern Lights, technically known as the Aurora borealis.</p>

<p>There are tons of articles and technical publications related to photographing these miraculous lights that magically appear in the far north at certain times of the year. They are caused by solar winds brushing by the earth’s magnetosphere. The most common color for the lights is green, but under certain conditions the lights can be orange, teal, purple or a combination of these.</p>

<p>Rather than get into a technical discourse, here is some basic information and some personal tips if you are thinking of capturing the Northern (or Southern) lights with your camera. Please note that most of this information is based on personal experience and discussions with my friend Richard Hartmier (<a href="http://www.hartmier.com/flash/light/light.html">http://www.hartmier.com/flash/light/light.html</a> ), an experienced Northern lights photographer who lives in Whitehorse, Yukon. I’m sure I left some things out, so feel free to suggest your own tips so our readers may benefit from your experience.</p>

</div>


<h2 style="text-align: center;">Preparation</h2>


<h3>Time of Year</h3>


<p>Richard points out that in the North it doesn’t get dark enough for Northern Lights until mid-August. “Fall is a great time for Northern Lights because you can take advantage of reflections in lakes and rivers. I love September for the Lights.”</p>

<p>Winter also works, with the best times being late February, March and April.</p>

<h3>Consult Websites</h3>


<p>“Before you go, consult a number of websites,” Richard advises. “Then make your go-no go decision.” If you are in the Yukon or Alaska, sites such as <a href="http://www.spaceweather.com">www.spaceweather.com</a>,  the University of Alaska, Canadian government sites and the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration (NOAA) each have sites that predict the aurora (just Google “aurora predictions”). However, keep in mind that aurora prediction is an inexact science and it’s common for sites to be way wrong.</p>

<h3>Dress Warmly</h3>


<p>The first step to getting successful lights images is to dress warmly. “Layers is the answer,” says Richard. However cold you anticipate it being, add yet another layer to accommodate the fact that you will essentially be standing still on snow for hours at a time. Use chemical hand warmers for your mittens and boots, as needed. They are available at outdoor stores, as well as big box stores like Costco or BJs. One pair for your gloves or boots will last a good 8 hours. Wear a warm hat, under your parka hood. Use two hand protectors; a thin glove so you can operate your camera controls and a warm pair of mittens over them.</p>

<h3>Use a Tripod</h3>


<p>“A good tripod is mandatory,” says Richard, and I agree. Since you’ll be using very long shutter opening times- up to 30 seconds- the only effective way to get good, sharp Aurora images is by using a tripod.</p>

<h3>… And a Cable Release</h3>


<p>Coupled with your tripod, use a cable release to minimize vibration and shake.</p>

<h3>… And a Headlamp</h3>


<p>You’ll need both hands free to change camera settings and orientation, level, batteries, etc.</p>

<h3>Bring Extra Batteries</h3>


<p>Charge your batteries before you go. Cold weather, especially the extreme cold you’ll encounter in the high north, saps battery power at an incredible rate. Bring extra charged batteries for your camera, headlamp, cable/electronic shutter release and any other battery-powered devices.</p>

<h3>Take Food</h3>


<p>Your body uses lots of calories to keep itself within a narrow temperature range. Take along high fat/high energy foods like nuts and raisins, along with a thermos of hot chocolate to keep yourself nourished.</p>

<h3>Site selection</h3>


<p>“Select a site with good foregrounds if that’s important to your composition,” Richard offers. “That might be a snow covered tree or water.” Richard prefers wide open spaces that give a 360 degree view of the sky, with mountains in the background. “It’s also nice to have moonlight in the image,” he advises, based on his extensive experience.</p>

<p>“Remember that you can always light foreground objects with your headlamp or a flashlight or even your flash,” an increasingly common effect seen on websites nowadays. “But, don’t push that too far,” cautions Richard. “You’re close to God here and I don’t go for too much artificial stuff.”</p>

<h2 style="text-align: center;">Camera Issues</h2>


<h3><strong>Using a Point-and-Shoot (PAS)</strong></h3>


<p>“Most PAS cameras are not up to shooting Northern Lights,” according to Richard. “If you are serious about Northern Lights, make the investment in a DSLR.” I agree, although you can get passable (but not professional level) images with a PAS. Some of the newer PASs, like the Cannon G12, do offer needed options which will allow you to get terrific aurora shots (see below). However, no matter what type of camera you use you really need to use a tripod for good results.</p>

<h3>Change to Manual Focus</h3>


<p>If you are using a PAS (or a DSLR), read your manual and learn how to put it into manual focus mode and then set focus to infinity. Note that some autofocus lenses under- or over-focus at infinity, so it’s a good idea to set up your camera while it is still light and focus it manually on a distant point and be sure to get critical focus. Then, make a mental note of where the pointer on the lens barrel points in relation to the infinity symbol (you may even want to use a permanent marker to mark the spot). Pre-set your camera to that focus setting, leave it on manual focus before you leave and be sure to wear a head lamp. The fewer things you have to fiddle with in the dark, the better your experience- and results- will be.</p>

<h3>Shoot Wide Open</h3>


<p>“The main thing is you need a wide angle lens with a fast aperture,” Richard suggests. The “faster” your lens, the better the results will be, because ypu’ll be able to use shorter exposure times and capture the lights more crisply.</p>

<p>Use a wide angle lens (no more than 28 mm, but preferably 20mm&#8230; or even less) with a rated f stop of 2.8 or less. A rating of 2.0 or 1.4 is even better, but such lenses are expensive. Check the used market for good deals on manual focus lenses. I checked eBay (February, 2011) and found several Nikon 24mm f2.0 lenses for under $500.</p>

<p>Richard is adamant on this issue if you want to achieve professional results. &#8220;My recommendation is that  top notch manual focus lenses like the new Zeiss offerings or some of the older manual focus lens that are still available on the used market are a lot easier to achieve and maintain infinity focus in the field.&#8221;</p>

<p><strong>Set Your ISO</strong></p>

<p>Try to use as low an ISO setting as possible. As you increase your ISO, noise increases and will affect your image. Noise in digital cameras is what grain was in film days. On the other hand, if by lowering your ISO you will increase your exposure time to more than 30 seconds, then bump up your ISO a bit. Lights photography is a bit of a balancing act.</p>

<h3>Turn on Noise Reduction</h3>


<p>Many cameras have a setting that minimizes noise. However, that usually doubles the amount of time it takes to record the image. So, for example, if you leave the shutter open for 20 seconds, it will take an additional 20 seconds for the in-camera computer to reduce the noise. Aurora photography involves a lot of patience and trial-and-error.</p>

<h3>Don’t Use Filters</h3>


<p>Whatever you do, be sure to remove all filters from in front of your lens. Filters can cause interference patterns that will ruin the images (in the sample, below, note the bulls-eye rings in the aurora, just above the  river).</p>

<p><a href="http://blog.lesterpickerphoto.com/wp-content/uploads/2011/02/2008-Yukon-Dawson-City-332008-09-191.jpg"><img class="size-medium wp-image-975" title="Northen lights over Yukon River, Dawson City, Yukon, Canada" src="http://blog.lesterpickerphoto.com/wp-content/uploads/2011/02/2008-Yukon-Dawson-City-332008-09-191-300x199.jpg" alt="" width="300" height="199"></a></p>

<h3>Start at 20 Seconds</h3>


<p>With your camera on manual focus and set on infinity, trip your shutter and time it to stay open for 20 seconds as a starting point. In some cameras, you will need to set your camera to “Bulb” to accomplish this. Other cameras have pre-set long time intervals to make the job easier.</p>

<p>Once the camera is done processing the image, use your screen to assess results. Against the black of night it’s easier to do this than during daylight. If you can magnify the image in camera, do so and examine the shadowed areas and aurora areas for noise.</p>

<p>If the aurora is too faint, increase the exposure time by 5 seconds and try again. However, try not to go above 30 seconds because you will then get smears in the image instead of distinct starlight points. Those smears are actually star tracks formed by the earth’s rotation. “The shorter the exposure, the better,” advises Richard, “because you’ll get better details in the lights, better streaks and better curtains. Boost your ISO to the highest possible without introducing noise.”</p>

<h3>Stay On It</h3>


<p>Just because 25 seconds works at first, doesn’t mean it will work later in the display. Auroras are highly variable. Sometimes they will be faint and ten minutes later they pulse with energy. So, always maintain your vigil and adjust exposures to suit.</p>

<h2 style="text-align: center;">After the Shoot</h2>


<h3>Guard Against Condensation</h3>


<p>Your cameras will cold through and through when your shoot is done. Before you come back inside, whether to a warm car or hotel or house, place your cameras and lenses in a sealed plastic bag so condensation forms on the outside of the bag and not on and in your cameras. Condensation inside your camera can ruin the electronic and mechanical components (see my previous blog on condensation: <a href="http://blog.lesterpickerphoto.com/2011/01/06/condensation-recommendation/">http://blog.lesterpickerphoto.com/2011/01/06/condensation-recommendation/</a>).</p>

<h3>Post-Processing</h3>


<p>“Lots of people use a contrast mask in PhotoShop or use another method to boost contrast,” Richard points out. “You may also want to fiddle with White Balance until the image looks like it looked to you in the sky.”</p>

<p>Good luck with your aurora experiments. Remember, a warm photographer is a happy one.</p>

		  <div class="entry-content"><p>As Robert Burns so ably said: “The best laid plans o’ mice of men, gang aft agley.” Or, as my dear mother used to say: ”Man plans and God laughs.”</p>

<p>So, my trip up the Dempster Highway to the Arctic Circle to photograph the Porcupine caribou herd is now up in smoke. More accurately it is down in snowflakes, as in a blizzard with 90 km/hour winds and whiteout conditions that was expected to last for days. Two winter storms converged right over the Arctic Circle in Yukon territory, making the only road in and out impassable.</p>

<p>I’m bummed; 3,500 miles and nothing to show for it in terms of wildlife photography. But I did finally get to see the Yukon Quest dogsled race, which was phenomenal (see previous post:<a href="http://blog.lesterpickerphoto.com/2011/02/09/the-yukon-quest-begins/">http://blog.lesterpickerphoto.com/2011/02/09/the-yukon-quest-begins/</a>), so the trip was not a total loss. And I love Yukoners and the very unique characters that they are, so many a night was spent over some good beer and even better company.</p>

<p><a href="http://blog.lesterpickerphoto.com/wp-content/uploads/2011/02/2008-Yukon-Dawson-City-332008-09-19.jpg"><img class="size-medium wp-image-968" title="Northen lights over Yukon River, Dawson City, Yukon, Canada" src="http://blog.lesterpickerphoto.com/wp-content/uploads/2011/02/2008-Yukon-Dawson-City-332008-09-19-300x199.jpg" alt="" width="300" height="199"></a></p>

<p>Before I left I did make tentative plans to go back next March, both to capture images of caribou and to improve my chances of Northern Lights images. But for now, sad to say, it’s the end of my Yukon winter adventure, although I’m slated to return late this summer (for Yukon Fall images) with a group of friends. Yukon in summer is a different animal entirely, but one I enjoy every bit as much. Stay tuned.</p>

		  <div class="entry-content"><p>If you’re headed for a Yukon adventure, you’ll almost definitely stay in Whitehorse at some point in your travels. With a population of 25,000, Whitehorse is by far the largest city in the Yukon. In fact, if you subtract Whitehorse’s population, there are only about 8,000 additional Yukon residents occupying a territory nearly 20% larger than California (and that state has around 35 million people)!</p>

<p>Whitehorse, capital city of the Yukon, is really a lovely small city, the kind you can easily wrap your brain around. One of the things I love most about it is that, unlike so many American cities, there is actually a walkable downtown where residents do much of their shopping. There are clothing stores, restaurants, two real, live bookstores, small hotels and lots of coffee shops. There are huge, colorful murals covering many of the downtown buildings, celebrating aspects of life Up North. So, for those of you contemplating a trip “Up North,” here is my modest guide to Whitehorse.</p>

<p><a href="http://blog.lesterpickerphoto.com/wp-content/uploads/2011/02/Yukon-Quest2011-around-downtown-Whitehorse-9.jpg"><img class="size-medium wp-image-953" title="Yukon Quest2011-around downtown Whitehorse 9" src="http://blog.lesterpickerphoto.com/wp-content/uploads/2011/02/Yukon-Quest2011-around-downtown-Whitehorse-9-300x200.jpg" alt="" width="300" height="200"></a></p>

<p>I’ll periodically update this section each time I visit and discover new treats, so check again before you take off for the North. Also, make sure to visit my blogs on Dawson City (<a href="http://blog.lesterpickerphoto.com/2011/02/10/dawson-city-or-bust/">http://blog.lesterpickerphoto.com/2011/02/10/dawson-city-or-bust/</a>).</p>

<h3>Coffee Rules!</h3>


<p>In a land where winter occupies most of the pages in the calendar, coffee is the drug of choice. Whitehorse sports a dozen (maybe more) coffee shops, so you’re sure to find at least one that will appeal to you. Here is a sampling.</p>

<p>If you’ve never tried one before, you’ve got to make at least one stop at <strong><em>Tim Horton’s </em></strong>(there are two of them on Second Avenue), which is the Canadian equivalent of Dunkin’ Donuts. Personally, I’m not a Horton’s fan, but think of it as part of your Canada acculturation process.</p>

<p>Next up is the omnipresent <strong><em>Starbucks</em></strong>, and Whitehorse hosts two of them. One is situated on Main Street (201 Main Street), at a major downtown intersection and is hard to miss.</p>

<p>My favorite downtown coffee shop is <strong><em>Baked Cafe</em></strong> (100-108 Main Street), although it has now been “found” and is often crowded. However, the coffee is great and the pastries divine. Baked also offers a wide range of healthy, delicious sandwiches for breakfast or lunch. Try one of their egg panini sandwiches for breakfast. Hot off the grill it’s hard to beat on a cold morning.</p>

<p><a href="http://blog.lesterpickerphoto.com/wp-content/uploads/2011/02/Yukon-Quest2011-around-downtown-Whitehorse-22.jpg"><img class="size-medium wp-image-949" title="Yukon Quest2011-around downtown Whitehorse 22" src="http://blog.lesterpickerphoto.com/wp-content/uploads/2011/02/Yukon-Quest2011-around-downtown-Whitehorse-22-300x200.jpg" alt="" width="300" height="200"></a></p>

<p>If you’re headed for a day of cross-country skiing, snowshoeing, snowmobiling or just sightseeing, be sure to stop at <strong><em>Bean North Coffee Roasting Company</em></strong>. Located on the Takhini Hot Springs Road, you could couple a hearty cup of java with a dip in the hot springs. Bean North is housed in an old house and you’ll sit in comfortable chairs and couches while you sip your favorite beverage. All coffee is roasted on site and they also provide the coffee for Baked Cafe.</p>

<p><a href="http://blog.lesterpickerphoto.com/wp-content/uploads/2011/02/Yukon-Quest2011-Bean-Noth-Coffee-Roasters-Takhini-8-1.jpg"><img class="size-medium wp-image-959" title="Yukon Quest2011-Bean Noth Coffee Roasters-Takhini  8 (1)" src="http://blog.lesterpickerphoto.com/wp-content/uploads/2011/02/Yukon-Quest2011-Bean-Noth-Coffee-Roasters-Takhini-8-1-200x300.jpg" alt="" width="200" height="300"></a></p>

<h3>Restaurants</h3>


<p>There is no shortage of restaurants in Whitehorse. From meat and potatoes to fresh caught salmon, you’ll be able to find it here. One thing to note. The Yukon is known for its water-to-table salmon and char. Here you’ll also find fresh meats, including bison and elk. Another note: Yukon is very informal. You never really need to dress up, even at the most upscale establishments. Here are some of my favorite restaurants.</p>

<p>You’d hardly expect a Caribbean-themed restaurant in the Yukon, but <strong><em>Antoinette’s</em></strong> (Fourth Avenue off Wood Street) is a classy, avant garde establishment with atmosphere and attitude. Run by Antoinette Oliphant, the restaurant of her name has an eclectic, but surprisingly delectable menu. Antoinette herself is a joy and she freely mingles with customers, making them feel at home.</p>

<p>Right next door to Antoinette’s is <em><strong>Ruby’s</strong></em>, a funky restaurant catering to vegans. Ruby’s is owned and run by Antoinette’s parents who recently moved to the Yukon and are experienced restaurateurs in their own right.</p>

<p><strong><em>Klondike Rib and Salmon</em></strong> (Second Avenue off Steele Street) is an enormously popular restaurant, and for good reason. They serve fresh food, good bread and trimmings. However, they are not open in winter, as you can see from the following sign in their window.</p>

<p><a href="http://blog.lesterpickerphoto.com/wp-content/uploads/2011/02/Yukon-Quest2011-around-downtown-Whitehorse-44.jpg"><img class="size-medium wp-image-950" title="Yukon Quest2011-around downtown Whitehorse 44" src="http://blog.lesterpickerphoto.com/wp-content/uploads/2011/02/Yukon-Quest2011-around-downtown-Whitehorse-44-300x200.jpg" alt="" width="300" height="200"></a></p>

<p>The restaurant is designed as a cabin tent. When the place is hopping, it can be crowded and noisy, but the food is superb. Try their ribs or muskox dishes, which my companions tell me is delicious (I wouldn’t know, since I don’t eat meat). Their fish and chips (which I do eat) was delicious, washed down with an ice-cold Yukon Gold beer.</p>

<p>For a change of pace, I love <strong><em>Sakura Sushi</em></strong> (404 Wood Street off Fourth Avenue), a Japanese establishment with a wide variety of dishes. Their sushi is to die for, especially those that incorporate salmon and char. They also have refreshingly different fruit sushi. I particularly enjoy their BC Box, an assortment of sushi, tempura, soy and ginger grilled salmon, cabbage and rice.</p>

<p>A close second in terms of Japanese fare is <strong><em>Tokyo Sushi</em></strong> (204 Main Street). Their lunch specials are a good deal and a great pick-me-up on frigid days. .</p>

<p>The <strong><em>Cellar Steakhouse and Wine Bar</em></strong>, located in the basement of the Edgewater Hotel (First Avenue and Main Street) is a renovated space devoted to upscale dining, with an expanded wine selection. When I recently dined there, all appetizers were excellent. My companions all raved about their meat dishes. I ordered a salmon dish and found it dry, reflecting the newness of the kitchen staff. However, I believe the restaurant has good potential, as it irons out the kinks.</p>

<p>The <strong><em>Burnt Toast Cafe</em></strong> is another option for breakfast or lunch, offering traditional, as well as unexpected fare. Nice wait staff always helpful with recommendations and good food, too.</p>

<p><strong>Earls Restaurant</strong> (9016 Quartz Road) is a chain eatery with generally good food and a friendly waitstaff. Their food is what I call &#8220;solid,&#8221; meaning tasty and fresh, but not inspiring. Their lunch menu is especially good. I enjoy their soups, with a side of Rosemary-Oregano Bread. Be warned that the bread portion is enough to feed two or three people with normal appetites.</p>

<p>I wouldn’t exactly call the <strong><em>Urban Cake Shop</em></strong> a restaurant, but it is a damned good place for traditional as well as zany cupcakes.</p>

<p>Okay, I kinda saved the best for last. If you’re going from Whitehorse to Dawson City, plan to stop about 75 minutes out of town for breakfast. Now, here’s the point; skip breakfast! Instead get one of <strong><em>Braeburn Lodge</em></strong>’s Cinnamon Buns. Just one. It’s guaranteed to feed at least 4 people and you’ll still have some left over for an after lunch treat. It truly is THAT good! Proprietor (and baker) Steve Watson is the big, burly guy with the white beard. Enjoy a cup of hot coffee with him. Thanks to Sibell and Stephen for the introductions.</p>

<h3>Hotels</h3>


<p>Whitehorse offers a range of lodging, from hostels and low-budget motels to comfortable (but not luxury) hotels. I’ve only had experience with  four hotels, and two I feel comfortable recommending.</p>

<p>I generally stay in the <strong><em>Westmark Hotel</em></strong> (Wood Street and Second Avenue), which is owned by Holland America cruise line. Yukon is offered as a trip extension for Holland America Alaska cruises, hence the connection. I’d describe the hotel as 3-star, but the staff is unbeatable, willing to go out of their way with friendly, fast service. The restaurant draws locals, which says a lot about its unpretentious ambience.</p>

<p>If you are using Whitehorse as a quick stop en route to Dawson City or points north, you really can’t do better than the <strong><em>Skyy Hotel</em></strong>, right across from the airport. Aside from clean rooms, the in-house restaurant is excellent and a destination eatery for Whitehorse residents.</p>

<h3>Events</h3>


<p>For the penultimate Yukon experience, there is nothing that can beat the<strong><em> Yukon Quest</em></strong>, the annual 1,000 mile long dogsled race that goes from Whitehorse, Yukon to Fairbanks, Alaska. The Quest is widely considered the most grueling, eclipsing the Iditarod.</p>

<p>The Quest alternates its starting gate, with odd years launching from Whitehorse and even years from Fairbanks so you’ll need to make plans accordingly. When the race leaves from Whitehorse, the tourism folks do a bang-up job of making it a fun family event, with celebrations lasting a week. There are hot air balloons, a banquet, dogsled rides, and lots more.</p>

<p>Whitehorse sponsors festivals throughout the year, including the Frostbite Music Festival, the Available Light Film Festival, Kayak and triathlete marathons, summer and fall events. Go to <a href="http://www.trafelyukon.com">www.travelyukon.com</a> for details.</p>

<h3>Activities</h3>


<p>You name the summer or winter sport and it’s available in and around Whitehorse. There are just too many vendors to mention here, but suffice it to say that the best tend to stay in business.</p>

<p>For dogsledding adventures for a day to a week or more, I recommend<strong><em> Sky High Wilderness Adventures</em></strong> (<a href="http://www.skyhighwilderness.com">www.skyhighwilderness.com</a>) and <strong><em>MukTuk Adventures</em></strong> (<a href="http://www.muktuk.com">www.muktuk.com</a>), run by the inveterate Frank Turner, the record holder for longevity in the Quest race, with 24 completed races under his belt.</p>

<p>Whitehorse also has top-ranked adventure guides and facilities offering canoeing along the Klondike and Yukon Rivers, as well as kayaking, motor boating, fishing and more.</p>

<p>Flightseeing is available year round. One solid company is <strong><em>Sifton Air</em></strong> in Haines Junction (<a href="http:/www.yukonairtours.com">www.yukonairtours.com</a>), about 90 minutes from Whitehorse. They run glacier tours into Kluane National Park surely one of the most spectacular places on Earth. I especially recommend the winter tours and suggest taking a morning or late afternoon flight when the sun is low in the sky and the mountains are warmed by the sun’s rays. On my recent flight, we spotted 12 moose, 2 wolves, and two coyotes. We even tracked a grizzly that had briefly awakened from its winter sleep but were unable to locate the animal itself.</p>

		  <div class="entry-content"><p>Dawson City, Yukon, is like an itch under your skin. No matter how much you scratch, it’s always there. That’s how Dawson City is for me. I love this whacky, unpaved, raw hole in the wilderness, where the people are real and the frontier mentality is alive and well. When I’m gone for any appreciable time, I think of it and its zany character.</p>

<p><a href="http://blog.lesterpickerphoto.com/wp-content/uploads/2011/02/Yukon-Quest2011-Dawson-City-28.jpg"><img class="aligncenter size-medium wp-image-942" title="Yukon Quest2011-Dawson City 28" src="http://blog.lesterpickerphoto.com/wp-content/uploads/2011/02/Yukon-Quest2011-Dawson-City-28-300x200.jpg" alt="The Downtown Hotel" width="300" height="200"></a></p>

<p>Dawson City was built nearly overnight, at the height of the Klondike Gold Rush. During its heyday in 1898, Dawson had more than 40,000 people, every one them somehow involved in the madness of the gold rush. Today the town has perhaps 1,200 residents, although that number climbs somewhat in summer.</p>

<p>Today, Dawson is the epicenter of wilderness travel, the launch point for canoeing, kayaking, hiking and touring adventures. It is the provisioning place for those traveling to the western Arctic Circle and beyond. I’m here today for two reasons. First is to cover the Yukon Quest dogsled race, an epic 1,000 mile battle between man and dog and nature. Dawson City is a major stop in that race, a mandatory 36-hour layover for mushers and their dogs. Once all the mushers leave Dawson for their final dash to Fairbanks, Alaska, I’m off with fellow photographer Richard Hartmier to the Arctic Circle, where we hope to rendezvous with the Porcupine Caribou herd for a photo shoot.</p>

<p>Back to Dawson. Surrounding the city are the scarred remains of the gold rush, when massive mining machines entered the fray and tore through the earth, heaving tons of soil and rock aside in man’s unquenchable thirst for the gold metal. But the tiny town of Dawson itself is a jewel. First, there are fantastic places to eat, from simple breakfasts to fine dinners (specifics in a later blog). The streets are laid out in a neat grid, with museums and historic building left or restored to their former glory. There is even a wonderful Opera House that serves to this day as an entertainment venue.</p>

<p><a href="http://blog.lesterpickerphoto.com/wp-content/uploads/2011/02/Yukon-Quest2011-Dawson-City-13.jpg"><img class="size-medium wp-image-943 " title="Yukon Quest2011-Dawson City 13" src="http://blog.lesterpickerphoto.com/wp-content/uploads/2011/02/Yukon-Quest2011-Dawson-City-13-300x200.jpg" alt="" width="300" height="200"></a></p>

<p>Dawson was also the first town in Canada to have a gambling hall, and Diamond Tooth Gertie’s Gambling Hall is still operating. Aside from the gambling there is a marvelously entertaining, turn-of-the-century vaudeville show.</p>

<p>Of course, Dawson is a true frontier town and, as such, has its quirky side, most notably the Sourtoe Cocktail. Served at the historic Downtown Hotel, the drink requires one to… well… okay, there’s no way to sugar-coat this; it requires one to drink a shot of whiskey (or scotch or whatever your poison happens to be) in which a human toe is suspended. The rule is the toe must at least touch your lips, amidst much cheering and profane comments from your fellow inebriated friends. Now, to be sure the toe is biologically clean, stewing as it has been for many, many years in alcohol. But its shriveled, blackened appearance will test the mettle of the stoutest, grizzled Yukoner (let alone photographer originally from Brooklyn, NY). Proudly, I do sport certificate number 31179 (September 20th, 2008), for those you wanting to look up my membership in the rather exclusive Sourtoe Cocktail Club.</p>

<p>Robert Service, the great Canadian poet whose Cremation of Sam McGee is a staple in schools throughout North America, lived here in Dawson and his cabin is still preserved, along with Jack London&#8217;s cabin, all worthy of tours. You&#8217;ll see odes to these great literary figures throughout town.</p>

<h2 style="text-align: center;">Dawson City Details</h2>


<h3>Places of Interest</h3>


<p><strong>Dawson City Museum</strong> (595 Fifth Avenue: <a href="http://www.dawsonmuseum.ca">www.dawsonmuseum.ca</a>) is a wonderful educational venue for the family. As soon as you enter the museum you are presented with interactive displays explaining the geology of the region. Displays also cover the indigenous aboriginal cultures, as well as exploration by whites, the Klondike Gold Rush and development of Dawson City. There is also a nice gift shop with items on natural history, aboriginal culture, photography books, jewelry and more.</p>

<p><strong>Danoja Zho (Long Ago House) Cultural Centre</strong>: (<a href="http://trondekheritage.com/danoja-zho/">http://trondekheritage.com/danoja-zho/</a>) is a small, but critically important museum to understanding the First Nations culture in the region. The Tr’ondëk Hwëch’in culture was dominant in the area until the arrival of white culture and the Centre has displays that show how the native culture interacted with its environment. The Centre also has a wonderful gift shop, offering hand-crafted aboriginal items, clothing, jewelry, music and more.</p>

<p><strong>Moosehide Village</strong> (<a href="http://trondekheritage.com/our-places/trochek/">http://trondekheritage.com/our-places/trochek/</a>) is a vigorous hike from Dawson City along the banks of the Yukon River. It is a working aboriginal village and if you hike there, please respect the people and their homes. You must have permission to go there and it can be obtained at the reception desk at the Tr’ondëk Hwëch’in Government building.</p>

<p><strong>Klondike Institute of Art and Culture</strong> (2nd Avenue and Princess Street) offers exhibits of paintings and photographs and also coordinates art shows in Dawson City.</p>

<p>In addition to the above sites, there are numerous historic building located throughout Dawson City. The Park Service maintains a visitor’s information site on  Front and King Streets. They also offer walking tours of the city from May to September, using very knowledgeable guides dressed in period costumes.</p>

<p><strong>Dredge # 4</strong> on Bonanza Creek, just outside the city, is a national treasure. It is the largest wood hull dredge ever built and the mammoth gold-dredging behemoth is open for guided tours during the tourist season. It’s a fascinating tour and one I recommend for insights into Yukon’s mining history.</p>

<p><strong> Jack London Interpretive Museum</strong> (8th Avenue and Firth Street: ) offers guided tours explaining the life and times of the famed Yukon writer.</p>

<p><strong> Robert Service Cabin</strong> (8th Avenue, near the Jack London Museum: <a href="http://www.pc.gc.ca/lhn-nhs/yt/klondike/natcul/natcul-dawson/natcul5.aspx">http://www.pc.gc.ca/lhn-nhs/yt/klondike/natcul/natcul-dawson/natcul5.aspx</a>).</p>

<p><strong>The Dome </strong>(formally known as The Midnight Dome) is located just outside the city, about a 5-minute drive from downtown. The road winds up the dome and ends at the summit with a view that encompasses all Dawson and a picturesque part of the Yukon River. Great place for a family picnic and photos of the area.</p>

<h2>Hotels</h2>


<p>There are several hotels in Dawson, catering to hostelers and the general market. There are no luxury, 5-star accommodations (or even 4-star). I can personally recommend two of them, having stayed for extended times in both.</p>

<p><strong>Downtown Hotel</strong> (2nd Avenue and Queen Street: <a href="http://www.downtownhotel.ca">www.downtownhotel.ca</a>), home of the infamous Sourtoe Cocktail, is the accommodation most visitors consider the “must-stay” place. It’s historic structure and old-timey ambience will put you into the right frame of mind for turn-of-the-century Dawson City. However, the hotel is old and a bit on the ragged side. There is no elevator, so you’ll have to drag your bags up and down stairs. There is a nice restaurant, the Jack London Grill, in the hotel, particularly for breakfast. Adjoining the hotel is it’s bar, which serves the Sourtoe Cocktail in the evening (see prior blog: <a href="http://blog.lesterpickerphoto.com/2011/02/10/dawson-city-or-bust/">http://blog.lesterpickerphoto.com/2011/02/10/dawson-city-or-bust/</a>).</p>

<p><strong>The Eldorado Hotel</strong> (3rd Avenue and Princess Street: <a href="http://blog.lesterpickerphoto.com/2011/02/10/dawson-city-or-bust/">http://blog.lesterpickerphoto.com/2011/02/10/dawson-city-or-bust/</a>) has more modern accommodations than the Downtown Hotel. Once again, a lack of elevators means you’ll have to either lug your bags up or request help from the front desk. An attached restaurant/bar is perfect for casual food. Their nacho platter is huge, dripping with cheese and, paired with a beer, perfect for watching a hockey game.</p>

<h2>Restaurants</h2>


<p><strong>Klondike Kate’s</strong> (3rd Avenue and King Street: <a href="http://www.klondikekates.ca">http://www.klondikekates.ca</a>) has a good reputation for hearty Yukon foods and their popular Tin Roof pie. It can be crowded at peak times.</p>

<p><strong>Jack London Grill</strong>, located in the Downtown Hotel, serves basic fare. Good for breakfast and lunch, but I’d recommend elsewhere for dinner.</p>

<p><strong>Riverwest Bistro</strong> (Front and Queen Streets) serves up great coffee, hearty breakfasts and healthy lunch sandwiches. It’s my favorite breakfast and lunch spot in Dawson City during the tourist season. Not open in winter.</p>

<p><strong>The Drunken Goat </strong>(2nd Avenue and York Street) specializes in mediterranean foods, especially Greek. The portion sizes are generous and the food superb. It’s probably the best dining experience in Dawson.</p>

<p><strong>Sourdough Joe’s</strong> (Front Street, near Riverwest Bistro) serves incredibly good halibut or salmon fish and chips. If you’re into poutine, a French Canadian dish of french fries with melted cheddar, this is THE place in Dawson to get it. Only open during tourist season.</p>

<p>And, remember, dining in the Yukon, especially Dawson City, is very informal.</p>

		  <div class="entry-content"><p>To call the Yukon Quest merely a dogsled race is akin to calling the Superbowl just another football game. The Quest is the penultimate showdown, a grueling match of dogs and man (or woman) against whatever nature can conjure up on its worst day. It is a 1,000 mile long endurance test of man and beast.</p>

<p>Make no mistake about it; every musher and every dog is a finely tuned athlete, melded into a team that, if all goes well, functions seamlessly. These are working dogs in every sense of the word. They live to run and the love and devotion between musher and dog is evident before each racer takes off. Hugs, words of encouragement, last minute snacks for the dogs are proof of that caring.</p>

<p><a href="http://blog.lesterpickerphoto.com/wp-content/uploads/2011/02/Yukon-Quest2011-Mushing-Sky-High-Wilderness-Adventures-6.jpg"><img class="size-medium wp-image-934" title="Yukon Quest2011-Mushing-Sky High Wilderness Adventures 6" src="http://blog.lesterpickerphoto.com/wp-content/uploads/2011/02/Yukon-Quest2011-Mushing-Sky-High-Wilderness-Adventures-6-200x300.jpg" alt="" width="200" height="300"></a></p>

<p>The city of Whitehorse, Yukon takes on the air of a carnival during Quest on alternate years. Since the race takes mushers from Whitehorse to Fairbanks, Alaska, the starting venue alternates between the two cities. There is the kickoff banquet, a lively affair which anyone can attend. In Yukon, leave your formal wear at home. Typical dress at the banquet consisted of mukluk boots, wool sweaters and beaver fur hats.</p>

<p>Ten veterinarians examine every dog before the start and at every mandatory checkpoint. Led by Dr. Alan Hallman from Arizona, the Quest’s high standards are evident in the healthy looking dogs. There are mandatory stops long the route to allow both mushers and their dogs to rest. Each musher starts the race with 14 dogs. Few ever finish with all their dogs. Any dogs who become ill or injured are left with the team’s handlers at a checkpoint and immediately treated by the vets. This sport draws such passionate participants, every one of the 12 vets is a volunteer.</p>

<p>The winning musher will average about 100 miles per day. You simply cannot appreciate that feat until you arrive in the Yukon. The teams will encounter -40F temps regularly throughout the race. They will have to climb mountains that would challenge the most able mountaineer. Even worse, they will have to traverse steep mountain downhills that brings every skill to bear as they try to prevent the sleds from careening out of control.</p>

<p>Before the race begins, the expressions on the faces of the mushers changes radically from the celebratory mood of the banquet the night before to a high seriousness of purpose as each one loads his sled, feeds his dogs and finally, just minutes before the race starts, harnesses his dogs to the sled. Five of the 25 mushers are women.</p>

<p>At the start of the race I’m in the chute, positioned with probably 25 other photographers from around the world. I rarely do event photography - my specialty is landscape and wildlife- and in the excitement of the race I am so busy watching the goings on I sometimes forget to keep shooting.</p>

<p>Each musher leads a team into the chute and gives final hugs to his or her 14 team members. The noise of the dogs barking and howling, wanting desperately to start pulling, is overpowering. The mushers check the dogs’ booties, designed to protect the animals from ice cuts. They pull at the rigging to make sure they are secure. They whisper words of encouragement to their charges.</p>

<p><a href="http://blog.lesterpickerphoto.com/wp-content/uploads/2011/02/Yukon-Quest2011-Mushing-Sky-High-Wilderness-Adventures-5.jpg"><img class="aligncenter size-medium wp-image-935" title="Yukon Quest2011-Mushing-Sky High Wilderness Adventures 5" src="http://blog.lesterpickerphoto.com/wp-content/uploads/2011/02/Yukon-Quest2011-Mushing-Sky-High-Wilderness-Adventures-5-199x300.jpg" alt="Eager to start" width="199" height="300"></a></p>

<p>Thousands of spectators line the starting chute cheering each competitor. Every three minutes the race officials send off another team. In a little over an hour the din of the dogs is replaced by an eerie quiet, as the crowds saunter off to the many other events around town.</p>

<p><a href="http://blog.lesterpickerphoto.com/wp-content/uploads/2011/02/Yukon-Quest2011-Mushing-Sky-High-Wilderness-Adventures-2.jpg"><img class="size-medium wp-image-936" title="Yukon Quest2011-Mushing-Sky High Wilderness Adventures 2" src="http://blog.lesterpickerphoto.com/wp-content/uploads/2011/02/Yukon-Quest2011-Mushing-Sky-High-Wilderness-Adventures-2-200x300.jpg" alt="" width="200" height="300"></a></p>

<p>The Yukon Quest is a family event, a true celebration of man and dog pitted against whatever nature throws at them. What makes it all the more wonderful to me is that it takes place in the glorious Yukon.</p>

		  <div class="entry-content"><p>Okay, I&#8217;m hooked. After spending the afternoon at Sky High Wilderness Ranch in Whitehorse, Yukon, there&#8217;s no doubt in my mind I&#8217;ll be back, this time for a sled dog wilderness camping adventure. Few times have I had more fun as a travel photographer than I did today.</p>

<p><a href="http://blog.lesterpickerphoto.com/wp-content/uploads/2011/02/Yukon-Quest2011-Mushing-Sky-High-Wilderness-Adventures.jpg"><img class="size-medium wp-image-924 " title="Yukon Quest2011-Mushing-Sky High Wilderness Adventures" src="http://blog.lesterpickerphoto.com/wp-content/uploads/2011/02/Yukon-Quest2011-Mushing-Sky-High-Wilderness-Adventures-300x199.jpg" alt="" width="300" height="199"></a></p>

<p>Mushing is as endemic to the Yukon as ice hockey is to the rest of Canada. There are scads of outfitters, lodges and guides who will happily arrange a dogsledding adventure for individuals and families. Two of the best are Sky High and MukTuk Adventures, run by veteran musher Frank Turner. More on both of them in a later blog.</p>

<p>For now, two things to mention. First, these dogs are incredible. They live to work. Never have I seen animals so eager to run. If you doubt that at all, take a look at this YouTube video I shot for you on my iPod Touch.</p>

<p><a href="http://www.youtube.com/user/lespicker#p/a/u/1/WfmZm5-S7Rw">http://www.youtube.com/user/lespicker#p/a/u/1/WfmZm5-S7Rw</a></p>

<p>Next, the dogs&#8217; care. Despite what some would lead you to believe, these incredible animals are healthy, well cared for, and happy. They are raised with love from birth, although there are undoubtedly the rare instances of abuse, I&#8217;m sure. They are socialized as puppies by the older animals and by time they are adults, they are eager to join a team. They have practiced running free besides a harnessed team and are ready to pull as soon as they are hitched.</p>

<p>I have spent large chunks of time in the Yukon over the past four or five years and I have heard many a tale of a musher coming into a small bit of change and spending it entirely on his or her dogs.</p>

<p>But, enough about the dogs.</p>

<p>Mushing is pure poetry. The hectic harnessing and preparations, the dogs barking and baying to get started, finally gives way to the trail as one eases his foot off the &#8216;brake.&#8217; The dogs leap to life once they feel the tension gone and one enters a state of pure grace.</p>

<p>On a wooded trail it is work, steering through turns and negotiating tree limbs. But out on a wide-open lake, as we did today, the only sound you hear is the steady pull of the dogs and the crunching of the sled underfoot. It is instantly addicting.</p>

<p>Of course, we were all clothed properly, but even so the minus 15F temperatures reminded me to pull up my balaclava, pull down my earflaps and raise the hood of my parka. The Yukon is a very special place, dear to my heart and soul. With only 33,000 people, and 25,000 of them living in Whitehorse, the open space is stunning.</p>

<p>And, so we went, around and across Fish Lake, where at times the wind blew patches of snow off the frozen surface, exposing clear ice, our sleds slipping, sliding and scraping for just a few seconds.  Here you can see a view of the Fish Lake, with my able sled team leading me quietly along the trail.</p>

<p><a href="http://www.youtube.com/user/lespicker#p/a/u/0/0sqFuVabBwA">http://www.youtube.com/user/lespicker#p/a/u/0/0sqFuVabBwA</a></p>

<p>And here is the link to the Google maps, showing our route toward and around around Fish Lake.</p>

<p><a href="http://www.spotadventures.com/trip/view/?trip_id=241355">http://www.spotadventures.com/trip/view/?trip_id=241355</a></p>

<p>BTW, for you trivia aficionados, the Gee Haw in the title refers to the two directional commands they use with their dogs. Gee means turn right, while Haw means turn left.</p>

		  <div class="entry-content"><p>Well, after two or three nights of stargazing, Richard Hartmier and I finally got a tiny glimpse of Aurora borealis activity. I say we only because we were out photographing together. Richard lives in the Yukon and has extensively photographed the Northern Lights. In fact, his Aurora work can be found in his books and in postcards sold in gift shops throughout the Yukon.</p>

<p>We were at Fish Lake, perhaps 15 minutes outside the city of Whitehorse (pop: 24,000). There were clouds in the sky, not aparticularly good thing when photographing the Aurora. Normally you would want a large expanse of clear, black sky, with the stars bright.</p>

<p><a href="http://blog.lesterpickerphoto.com/wp-content/uploads/2011/02/Whitehorse-aurora-borealis.jpg"><img class="size-medium wp-image-914" title="Whitehorse aurora borealis" src="http://blog.lesterpickerphoto.com/wp-content/uploads/2011/02/Whitehorse-aurora-borealis-199x300.jpg" alt="" width="199" height="300"></a></p>

<p>In fact, the lights, as they are known up here, were not very energized that night. It took a long exposure to get this image (look for a future blog with tips on photographing the Aurora).</p>

<p><a href="http://blog.lesterpickerphoto.com/wp-content/uploads/2011/02/Whitehorse-aurora-borealis-1.jpg"><img class="size-medium wp-image-915" title="Whitehorse aurora borealis 1" src="http://blog.lesterpickerphoto.com/wp-content/uploads/2011/02/Whitehorse-aurora-borealis-1-199x300.jpg" alt="" width="199" height="300"></a></p>

<p>In the image above, I was looking in the same general direction, but in this instance the lights from  the city of Whitehorse lit up a band of clouds, flaming them orange.</p>

<p><a href="http://blog.lesterpickerphoto.com/wp-content/uploads/2011/02/Whitehorse-aurora-borealis-3.jpg"><img class="size-medium wp-image-916" title="Whitehorse aurora borealis 3" src="http://blog.lesterpickerphoto.com/wp-content/uploads/2011/02/Whitehorse-aurora-borealis-3-300x199.jpg" alt="" width="300" height="199"></a></p>

<p>In the image above, taken about an hour later, the aurora is diffuse over a massive area of sky. Again, the lights from Whitehorse are reflected by the clouds.</p>

<p>There is something magical, spiritual and very humbling about the Northern Lights. I&#8217;m not sure I can explain it, but I know that I definitely feel quite insignificant in its presence. Remember that these images are of a weak display. But even on that night, these images are only of a small part of the night sky. The actual display may totally envelope you, from one horizon to the opposite one.</p>

<p>Of course, one has to brave the frigid temperatures and whatever elements nature throws at you. Some nights the lights don&#8217;t appear at all, on other nights it is too cloudy. But when it does come together, it is awe-inspiring.</p>

<p>I do hope to capture lots more Northern Lights as we approach the Arctic Circle next week. I was also just informed that the caribou herd I&#8217;ve been wanting to photograph for years has finally made it to the Arctic Circle and I hope my visit coincides with their continuing presence. We&#8217;ll see.</p>

<p>My next blog will describe the Quest dogsled race, which just began today. It was one exciting, fun-filled event.</p>

<p>Until my next blog, try to stay warm.</p>

		  <div class="entry-content"><p>Okay, I think I figured out the way for you to follow my &#8220;tracks&#8221; in the Yukon, all the way up to the Arctic Circle and beyond.</p>

<p>Click on this URL and it should take you to a Google map. Make sure to switch to &#8220;Terrain&#8221; view on the right side of the map, if it is not already there when the site opens.</p>

<p>This was Day 1, a leisurely drive southward toward Skagway, Alaska. The day was a photographic bust, since it actually rained (rather than snowed). But, from the Terrain map you&#8217;ll get an idea of the grandeur of the Yukon topography.
<a href="http://www.spotadventures.com/trip/view/?trip_id=240772">Yukon Quest Trip-Day 1 - Photography trip - SpotAdventures</a>.</p>

<p>I did get a slightly good shot from the highway, when the rain let up for a few minutes. By the time I got my photo stuff set up the best light had already faded. But, it gives you an idea.</p>

		  <div class="entry-content"><p>So, right after I awoke to clear skies and no ice at all (see yesterday&#8217;s blog: http://blog.lesterpickerphoto.com/2011/01/31/delayed/), Air Canada managed to rebook me to Yukon so that I arrived pretty much the same day I was originally supposed to. I say &#8220;pretty much,&#8221; because I actually arrived in Yukon at 1:00 AM, but at least I was able to go out photographing with <a href="http://www.hartmier.com/">Richard Hartmier</a> after a few hours sleep.</p>

<p>The downside of my rebooking was that I arrived in Whitehorse, Yukon safe and sound, but my luggage did not. Thirty-five passenger bags were left in Vancouver for some inexplicable reason. I was able to get them by noon, though.</p>

<p>I&#8217;ve started using my SPOT GPS system, so you&#8217;ll be able to follow me in real time.. once I figure out how to link you to the correct site.</p>

<p>Our photo day was a bust in terms of images, but still a fun experience. It actually rained most of the afternoon! Now, we&#8217;re talking Yukon, folks. It should have been snowing. The temperature was a balmy 5C (41F), highly unusual this far north.</p>

<p><a href="http://blog.lesterpickerphoto.com/wp-content/uploads/2011/02/south-of-Whitehorse.jpg"><img class="size-medium wp-image-905" title="south of Whitehorse" src="http://blog.lesterpickerphoto.com/wp-content/uploads/2011/02/south-of-Whitehorse-199x300.jpg" alt="" width="199" height="300"></a></p>

<p>After a short nap, Richard picked me up again at 11:30 PM for a try at photographing the Northern Lights. Predictions at <a href="http://www.spaceweather.com">www.spaceweather.com</a> and the University of Alaska&#8217;s Northern Lights tracking site were for the start of a few days of good displays, but after two hours of standing around, waiting, a heavy layer of clouds moved in and we drove back to town.</p>

<p>Still, the experience was wonderful. The stars were so bright and close, you felt like you could just reach out and touch them. The temperature had dropped and the wind off Fish Lake was blowing steadily, but we were both dressed with layers and snow pants and a good parka. Then, in the distance, Richard was the first to pick up the howling of wolves. There is simply no way to properly describe the feeling of that sound, carried across the lake. Despite my layers, the howling gave me chills.</p>

<p>I get emotional at times like that, grateful for the opportunity to feel such a visceral connection to our natural world, but also keenly aware of just how fragile this tiny planet is, spinning within a nondescript galaxy in the immensity of the universe. It&#8217;s enough to make you wonder if we are wasting a once-in-a-universe opportunity to get it right.</p>

<p>I shared my thoughts with Richard, a curmudgeonly iconoclast if I ever met one, at which point he shared with me his deeply spiritual beliefs on the origin of our species. &#8220;It was a spaceship,&#8221; he says seriously, although in the pitch black it&#8217;s hard to see his face. &#8220;Just as they were passing earth they dumped their bilge tank. The conditions were just right. Voila, humans!&#8221;</p>

		  <div class="entry-content"><p>I decided to leave for the airport the night before my flight to Yukon, due to our local weather forecast here in Baltimore calling for ice and snow tomorrow morning. I figured if I avoided the icy roads going down to the airport in the morning, I might have a chance of making my flight.</p>

<p>No such luck! As soon as I checked into the hotel (of course it couldn&#8217;t have happened ten minutes earlier) I got a text message that my flight had been cancelled. Don&#8217;t they de-ice planes anymore?</p>

<p>So now I&#8217;m spending the night at a b-o-r-i-n-g hotel, one of those new brands that Starwood patched together to meet the needs of stranded passengers. It&#8217;s sort of an attempt at a Euro look. Not much in the way of furnishings, yet clean and very efficient. To be honest, when I&#8217;m stranded like this I&#8217;m really not looking for more. Just a comfy bed and a quiet place to read and write and listen to music.</p>

<p><a href="http://blog.lesterpickerphoto.com/wp-content/uploads/2011/01/IMG_1376.jpg"><img class="size-medium wp-image-888" title="IMG_1376" src="http://blog.lesterpickerphoto.com/wp-content/uploads/2011/01/IMG_1376-300x198.jpg" alt="" width="300" height="198"></a></p>

<p>The dark side of my delay is that I&#8217;ll get to spend another wonderful night in a hotel tomorrow night, this time in Vancouver, since the delay will also force me to miss my connection to Whitehorse, Yukon. That means a day less photography with my friend, a fantastic Yukon-based photographer named <a href="http://www.hartmier.com">Richard Hartmier</a>. If you haven&#8217;t yet seen his work, go to his website and enjoy (and ORDER HIS BOOK). His Northern Lights images are superb.</p>

<p>Okay, back to cleaning my lenses. Stay warm.</p>

<p><strong>PS: I awoke this morning to clear skies and not even a hint of precipitation. Damn!!</strong></p>

<p style="margin: 0.0px 0.0px 0.0px 0.0px; font: 12.0px Helvetica;">Well, the burnish is now off the image of the professional photographer, namely my image. <a href="http://photo.rwboyer.com">Bob Boyer</a>, my friend and very able assistant, has documented one step in the creative process that we are currently involved in. I could explain it here, but I’ll let Bob do the talking. Suffice it to say that the behind-the-scenes work ain’t pretty. It’s sort of like getting a look at how sausage is made and should go far to remove the luster of the nature photographer out there in the wilderness! Hey, we do have families to feed!</p>

		  <div class="entry-content"><p>It’s showtime again. In ten days I leave for a photo assignment in Yukon, Canada. This will be my fourth trip to the Yukon, a land I’ve grown to love, as much for its friendly, independent people as for its majestic scenery and incredible wildlife.</p>

<p>First some perspective. Yukon is in the northwestern corner of Canada, bordered by Alaska to its west and the Arctic Ocean to its north, British Columbia to the south and Northwest Territory to the east. It has approximately 33,000 residents, 24,000 of whom live in its capital city, Whitehorse. That leaves about 9,000 people spread over an area 20% larger than California! [BTW, California has 37 million residents. Even if you remove Los Angeles, that leaves 33 million. Hmmm!]</p>

<p><a href="http://blog.lesterpickerphoto.com/wp-content/uploads/2011/01/Grizzly.jpg"><img class="size-medium wp-image-867" title="Grizzly" src="http://blog.lesterpickerphoto.com/wp-content/uploads/2011/01/Grizzly-300x225.jpg" alt="" width="300" height="225"></a></p>

<p>There are two moose for every person in the Yukon, and nearly one bear. That’s aside from caribou herds, wolves, fox, mountain goats, mountain sheep and wood bison.</p>

<p>The scenery of the Yukon defies description. Mountains tower above lush valleys, pristine lakes mirror snow-capped mountains and the immense tundra in the north boggles the mind. But, to me, it’s the ever-present Yu-kun-ah, the mighty Yukon River that winds its way through this magnificent land, that is its icon, bringing its life-giving waters to all.</p>

<p><a href="http://blog.lesterpickerphoto.com/wp-content/uploads/2011/01/Yukon2009-Dempster-Highway-1782009-09-05.jpg"><img class="size-medium wp-image-868" title="Yukon2009-Dempster Highway 1782009-09-05" src="http://blog.lesterpickerphoto.com/wp-content/uploads/2011/01/Yukon2009-Dempster-Highway-1782009-09-05-300x199.jpg" alt="" width="300" height="199"></a></p>

<p>Twenty-five percent of Yukoners are aboriginal people, representing 14 First Nations, speaking eight different languages. Is it any wonder, then, that Yukon is a photographer’s dream?</p>

<p>But the idyllic Yukon that draws tourists by the thousands in summer is but a sliver of the true Yukon. I’ll finally visit the Yukon in winter, long a dream of mine. Yesterday it was minus 58 Fahrenheit in Dawson City and a balmy minus 36 in Whitehorse, a couple of hundred miles south. Of course that includes the wind chill factor, but since that is what my body feels, I’ll go with that measurement.</p>

<p>So, how does a photographer prepare for such conditions? Carefully. Being out in minus 50 is no lark. Ninety percent of such photography happens before one sets foot on site. There is the issue of making sure your clothing is layered and that your boots and socks can withstand such frigid conditions. There’s the research one needs to conduct on what the best synthetic balaclava is, worn underneath a hooded parka, of course. Finally, there are the hands, next to one’s eyes the most valuable asset to the photographer. In this case I’ll wear a set of thin fleece gloves underneath a warm mitten that I’ll take off for a few seconds at a time to manipulate my camera controls.</p>

<p>Photographing in extreme cold is a love-hate affair for me. Having lived in Maine for 10 years, I dread the bulkiness, the slowing of movement, the way my mind becomes numb as I wait an hour or more in the frigid cold for an animal to move into position. Yet it is also incredibly exhilarating, being out in the elements, sharing those precious moments with wildlife who struggle every minute to merely survive.</p>

<p>In such extreme cold I also worry about my equipment. In the pre-digital days, film would literally snap when being advanced in the camera. Nowadays, I know that my LCD screen in the back of my camera will slow and probably stop working at around minus 10. I’ll have to constantly remind myself to not breathe when looking through the viewfinder, else I’ll fog up the view. The mental list is long, but I force myself to go through it as I wait in order to keep my mind as sharp as possible.</p>

<p>Then there is the condensation issue,a real threat to our equipment (see my previous blog on condensation: <a href="http://blog.lesterpickerphoto.com/2011/01/06/condensation-recommendation/">http://blog.lesterpickerphoto.com/2011/01/06/condensation-recommendation/</a>). This provides me with a good outlet for my recycled Zip-Lock bags.</p>

<p>I’ll also be testing out some equipment that manufacturers have sent me to see how well they work in the field. Tests in the lab are fine, as far as they go. But being out in the field is the only way to see if working photographers can benefit from newer materials and designs.</p>

<p>My main assignment is to cover the start of the Yukon Quest dogsled race, a 1,000 mile, rough-and-tumble adventure that pits man/woman and dogs against the most brutal elements nature can muster. The Quest precedes the Iditarod by a month, but many consider it even more challenging. Surrounding the Quest is a week or more of events, including the world’s northernmost film festival.</p>

<p>I’m really looking forward to being back in the Yukon, visiting dear friends (more about them in a later blog), and photographing the snow-covered landscapes. One thing that I will do a bit differently is that I will begin using the SPOT Satellite Messenger System. This is an emergency beacon and tracking device that allows adventurers to call in an SOS. But, more than that, it also allows us to leave “tracks” that can be followed online. So, each day that I blog, I’ll post the URL address, so those of you following my progress can click on the link and up will pop a Google map with my exact location.</p>

<p>I look forward to your comments as I blog throughout my adventure. In the meantime, stay warm!</p>

		  <div class="entry-content"><p>Here is the second installment in what I promised would be a continuing series of photo self-assignments. As I discussed in my previous self-assignment blog (<a href="http://blog.lesterpickerphoto.com/2010/07/28/photography-homework-1/">http://blog.lesterpickerphoto.com/2010/07/28/photography-homework-1/</a>) I talked about the value of these ‘homework assignments, so I won’t go over it again here, except to say that the name of the game is practice, practice, practice.</p>

<p>Today I’m suggesting a seasonal assignment, one that plagues many photographers.</p>

<h3>Shooting in the Snow</h3>


<p>Snow is white, right? Not if you’ve ever photographed it. Snow can appear white and textured or overblown and featureless. It can even appear gray or yellow, much to the frustration of even advanced amateur photographers. You definitely witness the scene one way, yet in the camera or on your print it looks entirely different.</p>

<p>The reason why this happens lies entirely with your camera’s sensor, not with your eyes. In two areas even the best sensor is no match for the human eye. The first sensor deficit in in contrast. The human eye can register a much wider contrast range than can a camera sensor. The second area where sensors lag is in recording certain scenes, such as snow. Here’s why.</p>

<h3><strong>How a Sensor Works on Snow</strong></h3>


<p>A sensor works by trying to register a scene in 18% (neutral) gray. In other words, given a scene with lots of contrast, the sensor will assign a value of 100% to the brightest part of the scene and 0% to the blackest black. So with very snowy scenes, it tends to bring down the snow values to a yucky grayish tone. In essence it tries to make it closer to 18% gray.</p>

<p>There are several ways to deal with this problem. If you are a pro or advanced amateur, and you shoot in RAW format, you have the advantage of changing your white balance during post-processing. That flexibility is one the many reasons I recommend shooting in RAW. But what if you have a point and shoot, or simply don’t want to do much post-processing of your images.</p>

<h3>Solving the Gray Snow Problem</h3>


<p>Here’s a trick you can use. Simply increase the exposure anywhere from ⅓ stop to 2 whole stops! Sounds counterintuitive, right? But increasing the exposure brightens the scene and brings the snow back to its original hue. Unfortunately, there is no hard and fast rule for how much exposure increase you’ll need. Every camera meter, sensor and scene is different, so you’ll just have to experiment with it. Remember to look at your images in your LCD screen. If you are an advanced photographer, it’s critical that you look at your histogram to see if the graph is off the right side of the screen. If it is, you have blown out highlights and you need to back off the exposure bit by bit.</p>

<p>Also, experiment with your white balance (even many point-and-shoots nowadays allow you to do this). Did you know that simply switching your white balance from Automatic to Cloudy will  warm up the snow?</p>

<p><a href="http://blog.lesterpickerphoto.com/wp-content/uploads/2011/01/falling-branch-winter-1-of-11.jpg"><img class="size-medium wp-image-861" title="falling branch winter 1 of 1" src="http://blog.lesterpickerphoto.com/wp-content/uploads/2011/01/falling-branch-winter-1-of-11-300x199.jpg" alt="" width="300" height="199"></a></p>

<h3>Now For the Homework</h3>


<p>So, in the midst of winter now, our assignment is to dress warmly, go outdoors and take our time making various exposures until we get the effect we want. Please submit some of your images here for constructive critique or bragging rights. I promise to do the same on my Yukon trip in February and I’ll post the images shortly after.</p>

<p>Good luck!</p>

		  <div class="entry-content"><p>Right now I&#8217;m preparing for my next photo adventure. In early February I&#8217;m leaving for the Yukon and Arctic Circle, in part to cover the incredible, 1,000 mile Quest dogsled race. The February temperature can dip to -45 degrees Fahrenheit for days at a time. In upcoming blogs I&#8217;ll describe how I prep for such extreme  cold weather photography and I&#8217;ll be blogging in real time as the race proceeds. But for now I want to cover a particular issue related to photography in cold weather, namely condensation. But allow me to start this ‘lesson,’ if you will, in the tropics.</p>

<p>A few years ago I was onboard a cruise ship, lecturing as I do on digital photography. When we arrived at Tortola, I left the air conditioned ship and headed out to photograph the tropical paradise. As soon as I exited the ship’s security zone, I took the lens cap off my camera and… that’s when the trouble started.</p>

<p>Turns out my lens was completely fogged up from condensation. I had simply forgotten one of the most elemental laws of physics; when you move from a cold environment (meaning ‘dry’) to a warm one (meaning ‘wet’), water vapor will condense onto the surfaces of the colder objects. Yes, the vapor will eventually evaporate over a period of minutes to hours, but in the meantime the clouded lenses will prevent you from taking pictures. I always remember this when I’m out photographing in winter, but it just slipped my mind in the tropical environment.</p>

<p>I have seen people frantically wiping off their lenses to remove the condensation. That simply doesn’t work, since the lens surface will re-condense the moisture until it eventually reaches the same temperature as the outside warmer air. I have also seen people just keep on taking their pictures, unaware that they will turn out blurred when they later look at the pictures, due tot he vaseline-like effect of shooting through the foggy lens. That’s especially true when dealing with small point-and-shoot cameras whose lenses are small and recessed into the camera. It’s hard to even notice the condensation.</p>

<p>But, there is a bigger problem involved with condensation. Don’t make the mistake of thinking that the condensation is showing up only on the lens surface. It is also occurring <strong><em>inside</em></strong> the camera! It may not wreak havoc the first time it happens, but it can ruin the internal electronics as that moisture corrodes the circuitry.</p>

<p>Now back to winter. The same exact phenomenon occurs in reverse. The solution to the problem is simple. Whenever you are out photographing snow scenes or family ski trips, always bring along a zip-top or otherwise totally sealable plastic bag (in other words, not a twist-tie). Just before coming indoors, place your camera in the plastic bag and seal the bag. Bring the camera in and let it sit. You will notice condensation forming on the <strong><em>outside</em></strong> of the bag. That is good! Wait until the camera achieves room temperature and then you can remove it safely.</p>

<div><a href="http://blog.lesterpickerphoto.com/wp-content/uploads/2011/01/Camera-in-Bag.jpg"><img class="aligncenter size-medium wp-image-853" title="Camera in Plastic Bag (photo courtesy Canon)" src="http://blog.lesterpickerphoto.com/wp-content/uploads/2011/01/Camera-in-Bag-268x300.jpg" alt="" width="268" height="300"></a></div>


<p>Alternately, if you are an advanced amateur or professional photographer, just leave your camera in your zippered, weatherproof backpack for several hours after you go from cold to warm before removing your cameras.</p>

<p>BTW, if you do run into a condensation problem, the thing to do is to open up your camera back, open and empty the battery compartment and any open any other covered plug-in areas and let the camera dry out as quickly as possible. If you have a DSLR, uncouple the lens from the camera body.  Make sure you also keep dust and debris from getting in at such vulnerable times.</p>

<p>In the meantime, stay warm when you are outside shooting (but that will be a separate blog!).</p>

		  <div class="entry-content"><p>Trumpets, please! Now some fanfare…. and roll the drums. It’s my annual New Year’s Photo Resolutions, Version 2011.1 (meaning they will undoubtedly change as the year progresses). Here are my major goals.</p>

<h3>A Stitch In Time</h3>


<p>This year I plan to get into panoramas, which some of my clients are demanding. I already have a terrific tripod (Gitzo 3541) and ball head (Really Right Stuff BH-55), so with that solid base I’m going to add panoramas to my repertoire.</p>

<p>That means I will have to find, learn and then use a stitching program for panoramas. That also means I’ll have to actually shoot some panoramas. Not sure whether or not I’ll need a nodal attachment for my ball head, but I’d welcome your opinions on this. What stitching software do you use? Do you find you need a special nodal adapter to get professional looking results?</p>

<h3>Macro Managing</h3>


<p>This year I’d finally like to do more macro photography, something I really enjoy but just can’t seem to get around to doing very much. I travel a lot on assignment and it’s impossible for me to shlep a macro lens and macro attachments for my tripod, along with an appropriate lighting setup. I find I need a dedicated photo trip with just macro in mind and that’s difficult to carve out of my day. But, this year…</p>

<h3>Stage a Gallery Show</h3>


<p>If you know of a good, tasteful art gallery that welcomes nature/landscape photography exhibitions, please let me know. I’m in the market for a major show.</p>

<h3>Buy a D3x (or other 20+ megapixel Nikon camera)</h3>


<p>I need a big megapixel count since I make very large prints. I’ve waited long enough. Nikon graciously sent me a D3x to test. I liked it… a lot, but not enough to shell out $7,500 for a heavy monster with quirks. I may buy one when the price drops, or continue to wait until spring to see what new releases Nikon has in store for 2011.</p>

<p><a href="http://blog.lesterpickerphoto.com/wp-content/uploads/2011/01/nikon-d3x.jpg"><img class="aligncenter size-medium wp-image-847" title="nikon-d3x" src="http://blog.lesterpickerphoto.com/wp-content/uploads/2011/01/nikon-d3x-300x145.jpg" alt="" width="300" height="145"></a></p>

<h3>Complete an e-Book</h3>


<p>I’m working hard on developing an exciting e-Book for photographers. Once I get some shots that I need, I’ll go into the final stretch. My goal is to have it ready in May. We’ll see.</p>

<p>Now, what are <strong><em>your</em></strong> photo goals for 2011? Willing to share?</p>

		  <div class="entry-content"><p>I’m currently doing some preliminary research for a proposed photographic workshop I’ll be leading to Egypt in November, 2012. Egypt is one of the most photogenic places on Earth, not just for its antiquities, but for its warm and friendly people. I have been to Egypt several times in my career and I find that I can never get enough of it.</p>

<p>In any event, in putting together an itinerary that I think photographers would enjoy and that would add high impact images to their portfolio, I knew that it would have to include il Fontina Island, as it is called in Arabic, and known to most of the world as Elephantine Island. il Fontina is situated smack in the middle of the Nile River, immediately opposite downtown Aswan and its famous Cornish el Nile (Nile river walk). It has carried its elephantine name since antiquity due to the huge boulders that sit near the island, resembling the curved backs of elephants. You might be surprised to know that elephants once roamed as far north as Aswan, possibly as late as 5,000 B.C., before desertification overtook southern Egypt.</p>

<p>What makes il Fontina so special are its people. Egyptians are composed of two major branches; those of mid-eastern descent and the Nubians, a dark-skinned people whose stock is from farther south, in what is present day Sudan and further south. il Fontina is populated by those of Nubian heritage. They are still Muslim, but have a rich oral history that includes their African heritage.</p>

<p><a href="http://blog.lesterpickerphoto.com/wp-content/uploads/2010/12/il-Fontina-kids-1-of-1.jpg"><img class="size-medium wp-image-842" title="il Fontina kids 1 of 1" src="http://blog.lesterpickerphoto.com/wp-content/uploads/2010/12/il-Fontina-kids-1-of-1-227x300.jpg" alt="" width="227" height="300"></a></p>

<p>Only those who have walked the dirt alleyways of il Fontina can understand what it is like. Literally five minutes by public ferry from the hustle, bustle and hawking of Aswan, you are suddenly transported to a world that existed 5,000 years ago. The houses are still built as they were in pre-Dynastic times, out of mud brick and even the more primitive mud daub construction. If you go here (<a href="http://www.lesterpickerphoto.com/photo.php?id=271&amp;gallery=egypt">http://www.lesterpickerphoto.com/photo.php?id=271&amp;gallery=egypt</a>) you can see on my Gallery website what I am talking about.</p>

<p>People still fish the Nile River using round, weighted nets that are tossed by hand. Fellucas sail lazily by, their masts silhouetted by the cloudless azure sky. The only sounds you’ll hear are the bleating of goats and the calls of mothers to children when strangers come near. Women dress in traditional Muslim garb as they walk barefoot around one of the two villages (<a href="http://www.lesterpickerphoto.com/photo.php?id=273&amp;gallery=egypt">http://www.lesterpickerphoto.com/photo.php?id=273&amp;gallery=egypt</a>).</p>

<p>I recall vividly a bright, February day in 2001 as I sat alone on a shoreline bluff, eating my lunch of cheese and peasant bread a few yards above the fishing fleet, watching the men and boys repairing nets and boats. Suddenly a woman appeared behind me, looking for her son. “Mohammed!,” she yelled down. Immediately at least half a dozen men looked up. I smiled at this natural by-product of Muslim life, where names are traditionally derived from one of the 99 names for Allah in the Koran.</p>

<p><a href="http://blog.lesterpickerphoto.com/wp-content/uploads/2010/12/il-Fontina-feluccas-1-of-1.jpg"><img class="size-medium wp-image-843" title="il Fontina feluccas 1 of 1" src="http://blog.lesterpickerphoto.com/wp-content/uploads/2010/12/il-Fontina-feluccas-1-of-1-300x200.jpg" alt="" width="300" height="200"></a></p>

<p>For our workshop, we will probably stay on il Fontina Island, an option that was not even  conceivable just 10 years ago. Now there is a huge, modern European-style hotel on the south side of the island. A pity, really. But my sources tell me that the people and villages of il Fontina are still lovely, a charm born of antiquity.</p>

<p>You&#8217;ll notice that I rendered many of the new images in B&amp;W. I love B&amp;W photography, but my hand was forced in this case by the horrible weather we encountered.

		  <div class="entry-content"><p>Having spent four of the grayest, rainiest weeks ever in Australia, Fiji, New Caledonia and New Zealand, it reminded me of a valuable pro photographic lesson that I’ll share with you. It’s called ‘extraction.’</p>

<p>Of course, every photographer loves sunny days with lots of blue sky and clouds. But, what do you do when you get to a place where you only have a day or two and the weather sucks? Maybe it’s actively raining (that’s the subject of a future blog) or, worse yet, the sky is a featureless, dull gray, the proverbial kiss of death for photographers. Even dark, angry clouds are great for dramatic impact, so no complaints from this photographer when the weather threatens. But those dull, lifeless skies are the nemesis of the hardworking pro.</p>

<h3>Extraction Shots</h3>


<p>So, what we do in that case is extract images from the background and simply exclude that dull sky, the equivalent of making lemonade from lemons. In fact, plant and flower images often are best under gray skies, since the lighting is even and you don’t get harsh shadows or hotspots on the bright areas of flowers.</p>

<p>If you have a flower or tree with great colors- especially after a rain when raindrops are still visible on the petals- you can work with the scene and get acceptable images. In this shot, we were in the mountains of Doubtful Sound, on the South Island of New Zealand. It was a drizzly, gray day so I couldn&#8217;t shoot the mountain against the sky. Instead I shot this Mt. Cook lily. I wouldn’t call this a prize-winner, but I think it’s a solid image. Not sure what I’ll do with it, though.</p>

<p><a href="http://blog.lesterpickerphoto.com/wp-content/uploads/2010/12/Mt.-Cook-Lilly-Doubtful-Sound-New-Zealand-32010-11-17.jpg"><img class="size-medium wp-image-825" title="Mt. Cook Lilly, Doubtful Sound, New Zealand 32010-11-17" src="http://blog.lesterpickerphoto.com/wp-content/uploads/2010/12/Mt.-Cook-Lilly-Doubtful-Sound-New-Zealand-32010-11-17-200x300.jpg" alt="" width="200" height="300"></a></p>

<h3>Extracting Urban Scenes</h3>


<p>Ditto with urban scenes on yucky days, where you need to discipline yourself to take tight shots that give you a sense of place without including the sky. I had only two days in Christchurch, New Zealand and again the weather was terrible. I knew I couldn’t get the images I had planned, such as the cathedral against a blue sky with clouds. Nor could I get some of the Botanical Garden images I had planned. So, I changed my focus to extract shots of subject against a contextual background without including the sky. These two images give you an idea of what I’m talking about, both taken in Christchurch, at the cathedral of the same name.</p>

<p><a href="http://blog.lesterpickerphoto.com/wp-content/uploads/2010/12/Christchurch-South-Island-New-Zealand-502010-11-20.jpg"><img class="size-medium wp-image-826" title="Christchurch, South Island, New Zealand 502010-11-20" src="http://blog.lesterpickerphoto.com/wp-content/uploads/2010/12/Christchurch-South-Island-New-Zealand-502010-11-20-200x300.jpg" alt="" width="200" height="300"></a></p>

<p>(For those of you interested in the technical aspects, I rendered the next image in Black and White, but left the umbrella and the man&#8217;s shirt in color).</p>

<p><a href="http://blog.lesterpickerphoto.com/wp-content/uploads/2010/12/Christchurch-South-Island-New-Zealand-782010-11-20.jpg"><img class="size-medium wp-image-827" title="Christchurch, South Island, New Zealand 782010-11-20" src="http://blog.lesterpickerphoto.com/wp-content/uploads/2010/12/Christchurch-South-Island-New-Zealand-782010-11-20-199x300.jpg" alt="" width="199" height="300"></a></p>

<h3>Forest Extraction Images</h3>


<p>One final example. You can also isolate elements of a forest by using a telephoto and focusing on a specific tree or branch that has great color or an unusual shape. In this next image I was on a boat in Milford Sound, South Island, New Zealand on another miserable day. I would have loved to have landed on a solid shoreline to photograph the scene with my tripod so it would be tack sharp and I could include the foggy, misty sky, but that wasn’t possible. So I went with the flow (and rocking of the boat) and upped the ISO to 800 to extract trees from the background. I liked this shot for the compositional elements of the way the tree filled the frame and seems to flow through it, but it wasn’t tack sharp, usually a fatal flaw that forces me to press the Delete key. However, in this case I decided to have fun with it and I processed the image with a soft glow filter using Nik Software, something I rarely do, but I’m not apologizing for it. For me it works although, as always, I welcome your reaction and critique, which you can leave as a comment at the end of this blog.</p>

<p><a href="http://blog.lesterpickerphoto.com/wp-content/uploads/2010/12/Doubtful-Sound-New-Zealand-592010-11-17.jpg"><img class="size-medium wp-image-828" title="Doubtful Sound, New Zealand 592010-11-17" src="http://blog.lesterpickerphoto.com/wp-content/uploads/2010/12/Doubtful-Sound-New-Zealand-592010-11-17-199x300.jpg" alt="" width="199" height="300"></a></p>

<p>Until the next blog, don’t get driven to distraction by featureless skies. Take control and drive yourself to extraction.</p>

<p>Happy shooting!</p>

		  <div class="entry-content"><p>As a veteran photographer who has witnessed the digital revolution that effectively beheaded film photography, I can say that I’ve seen a lot in my day. And now that digital is here, the evolution has accelerated so that one can hardly keep pace with the innovations. Cameras that cost $5,000 when launched are replaced by cousins that are faster, more sensitive and have more features, at half the price.</p>

<p>Even my tiny iPod offers an HDR (High Dynamic Range) app. Admittedly, I have one of them- Pro HDR- on my device. Unbelievably, it does a very nice job… for a $1.99 phone app. So I was naturally intrigued by an article in today’s New York Times, which explores the future world of photography, from the perspective of some top academic research labs in America.</p>

<h3>Here It Comes!</h3>


<p>Are you ready for cameras that can realio, trulio take a picture around a corner and into a darkened room? Well, believe it, because researchers at M.I.T. are using lasers mounted inside a camera to fire pulses at one-trillionth of a second. The laser light bounces off walls and doors to illuminate what’s in another room. Creepy! It’s a ways off before we’ll see it in the marketplace, thank heavens.</p>

<p><a href="http://blog.lesterpickerphoto.com/wp-content/uploads/2010/12/images.jpeg"><img class="size-full wp-image-819" title="images" src="http://blog.lesterpickerphoto.com/wp-content/uploads/2010/12/images.jpeg" alt="" width="99" height="127"></a></p>

<p>I can’t imagine that innovation would be useful for my photography, but the CIA is probably foaming at the mouth waiting for it. However, another app that researchers are working on would be ideal for landscape photographers. It mathematically calculates the exact spot from which a photo was taken so you can re-shoot the scene precisely. That bests even GPS technology, which can get us to a scene, but not help us place the camera exactly. I can imagine using it to follow a scene through the seasons, for example, or perhaps to record environmental changes over time.</p>

<h3>Closed Code Stifles Innovation</h3>


<p>Apparently, one of the big issues in this burgeoning field is that cameras, unlike computers, are closed source. In other words, programmers can’t fiddle with the middle and add code that will allow them to experiment with new techniques. However, some forward-thinking companies are jumping on the bandwagon and giving the researchers access to the top-secret computer chips and code.</p>

<p>To see the NY Times article, go to: <a href="http://www.nytimes.com/2010/12/19/business/19novel.html?_r=1&amp;hpw">http://www.nytimes.com/2010/12/19/business/19novel.html?_r=1&amp;hpw</a></p>

		  <div class="entry-content"><p>I was contributing to a forum yesterday when the question came up about tripods. Specifically, the writer wanted to know whether to bring an additional lens along when he hikes the Grand Canyon or leave it home so he could bring along his tripod. Further, if he were to bring a tripod, he was seeking input on which lightweight one to get.</p>

<p>Two experienced photographers suggested the man bring a tripod and even offered suggestions on which lightweight model to buy. My slant on tripod use is slightly different and I’d like to share it with you here.</p>

<p>To my way of thinking there is no real point in squeezing in another lens, no matter how sharp and wonderful it is, if you don’t have a stable platform on which to place it. When shooting landscapes or wildlife, and you are looking for magazine-quality images, you simply have to use a tripod to frame the scene properly and eliminate camera shake. You may not think so, but adding a tripod can make the difference between a perfect image and a so-so one.</p>

<p>With the kind of shooting that I primarily do, namely landscapes, I want extreme depth of field. I may also use a filter or two. That translates to less light getting to the sensor and correspondingly longer exposure times, which in turn does not lend itself to hand-held shooting.</p>

<p>Look, I am a 55+ photographer and I lug a 30-pound backpack on mountain hikes. I also have a bad back (probably from carrying a 30-pound backpack!). But I’d never leave my big tripod (Gitzo 3541 and RRS BH-55 ball head) home. I’d rather leave behind a lens or two, and guarantee that I’ll have tack-sharp images, suitable for my editors. Of course, I’m assuming that the tripod is paired with a cable or electronic release.</p>

<p><a href="http://blog.lesterpickerphoto.com/wp-content/uploads/2010/12/TVC33.png"><img class="size-medium wp-image-814" title="TVC33" src="http://blog.lesterpickerphoto.com/wp-content/uploads/2010/12/TVC33-228x300.png" alt="" width="228" height="300"></a></p>

<p>Moving one step further, I choose to shlep a regular (carbon-fiber) tripod with me rather than a lightweight model for the simple reason that a tripod’s effectiveness as a stable platform is directly proportional to its total mass. I suppose that someone could argue that point with me until s/he is blue in the face, but that still wouldn’t change the laws of physics. One way to try to minimize that problem is to hang a weight (like your backpack, for example) from the center column, which adds mass and subsequently reduces vibrations, but that would, of course, work even better with a heavier tripod, right?</p>

<p>So, there you have it. My take on tripods.</p>

<p><strong>AIR CANADA VOTED TOP HONOURS BY READERS OF BUSINESS TRAVELER MAGAZINE</strong></p>

<div id="content">
<ul>
<li><strong>Best Flight Attendants in North America</strong></li>
    <li><strong>Best In-Flight Services in North America</strong></li>

I&#8217;m not professing to know about business travel, since I fly cattle-car within North American destinations. But I have been saying in my blogs that even in Economy, it&#8217;s hard to beat Air Canada.

<p>One of my favorite features is that there is a 120-volt outlet at every seat, as well as a USB port and terrific touch-screen entertainment system. Plug in, stick in your earbuds, turn on the music (or movie)  and you can either relax or get substantial work done with no hassles. They also really, truly have flight attendants who are attendant!</p>

<p>Anyway, congrats Air Canada on a recognition that is well deserved.</p>

		  <div class="entry-content"><p>I just completed my 10th cruise, this time aboard Royal Caribbean’s Rhapsody of the Seas, a beautifully designed, if slightly older vessel. I teach photography aboard these floating hotels and have sailed aboard Norwegian Cruise Lines and Princess, too.</p>

<p><a href="http://blog.lesterpickerphoto.com/wp-content/uploads/2010/12/Rhapsody-of-the-Seas-Royal-Caribbean-162010-11-07.jpg"><img class="size-medium wp-image-785" title="Rhapsody of the Seas-Royal Caribbean 162010-11-07" src="http://blog.lesterpickerphoto.com/wp-content/uploads/2010/12/Rhapsody-of-the-Seas-Royal-Caribbean-162010-11-07-199x300.jpg" alt="" width="199" height="300"></a></p>

<h3>My Cruise Experience</h3>


<p>Ten trips does not make me a cruise expert, especially since I regularly meet people with 30, 50 and more cruises under their belts (and we’ll get to what else is under those belts in a moment). But I do figure that my cruise experiences, coupled with the fact that I am a seasoned travel photojournalist, gives me some credibility to make some observations and recommendations (I’d also love to read your observations, and so will my readers, if you’ll kindly comment here on this blog).</p>

<p>First, I fought the cruise experience for decades, erroneously thinking that it was:</p>

<p>a. for older and/or more sedentary folks</p>

<p>b. too confining</p>

<p>c. for people with B-I-G appetites</p>

<p>d. all of the above</p>

<p>But, after much cajoling from my wife I finally succumbed and have been really enjoying them over the past five years.</p>

<p><a href="http://blog.lesterpickerphoto.com/wp-content/uploads/2010/12/Rhapsody-of-the-Seas-Royal-Caribbean-482010-11-07.jpg"><img class="aligncenter size-medium wp-image-786" title="Rhapsody of the Seas-Royal Caribbean 482010-11-07" src="http://blog.lesterpickerphoto.com/wp-content/uploads/2010/12/Rhapsody-of-the-Seas-Royal-Caribbean-482010-11-07-199x300.jpg" alt="" width="199" height="300"></a></p>

<h3>Cruise Ship Observations</h3>


<p>So, here goes with my observations. First, my hat is off to those younger couples that cruise with children. For those of you who have never cruised before, the cabins are efficiently laid out, but laughably small and I simply can’t imagine the challenges presented to families with little ones sharing the same cabin. Judging by the body language and dark circles under the eyes of those very same parents after about day three, cruising with young kids may not exactly make you a winner on “Are You Smarter Than a Fifth Grader?”</p>

<p>Next is an observation my wife and I made when we once went on two cruises back-to-back. Since we were cruising for two weeks straight, we did an informal survey and here’s what we found: seventy percent of the kids at the dining tables either played video games during dinner or had earphones in or on their ears (many also wore a baseball hat, with the brim turned backward). Have our cultural norms really changed that much? Why do parents allow such behavior? Do I sound like an old fart??</p>

<p>Okay, enough about kids and families. Longer cruises- those over 10 days- tend to draw an older crowd due to the expense involved and the time required. Our recent 12-day cruise from Sydney, Australia to Fiji and New Caledonia included many retirees. As a result, the trip was pleasantly quiet, as opposed to two shorter cruises we have taken from New York City, where it was a far younger, partying and drinking crowd. Keep that in mind when booking your cruise.</p>

<p><a href="http://blog.lesterpickerphoto.com/wp-content/uploads/2010/12/Rhapsody-of-the-Seas-Royal-Caribbean-782010-11-07.jpg"><img class="size-medium wp-image-787" title="Rhapsody of the Seas-Royal Caribbean 782010-11-07" src="http://blog.lesterpickerphoto.com/wp-content/uploads/2010/12/Rhapsody-of-the-Seas-Royal-Caribbean-782010-11-07-300x199.jpg" alt="" width="300" height="199"></a></p>

<h3>Eat Your Heart Out</h3>


<p>If you think that cruising is nothing but one big, fat eat-fest, you’re… well, actually you’re right. It’s the glutton’s version of The Grand Canyon. Let’s call it The Great Gorge. There are so many eating options, essentially 24/7, one could easily gain 10 pounds on a 7-day cruise. And it’s amazing to see how many serious over-eaters frequent these ships, from basic overweight-and-out-of-shape through obese to morbidly obese. There are the basic three squares a day that the dining service offers, which can be taken in a huge, gloriously extravagant dining room, served by a formal wait staff, or in a pile-it-higher-and-deeper smorgasbord buffet arrangement. In either case you can ask for, or get up and get, your own seconds, thirds or more. Of course, every meal includes multiple dessert options.</p>

<p><a href="http://blog.lesterpickerphoto.com/wp-content/uploads/2010/12/Rhapsody-of-the-Seas-Royal-Caribbean-572010-11-07.jpg"><img class="size-medium wp-image-788" title="Rhapsody of the Seas-Royal Caribbean 572010-11-07" src="http://blog.lesterpickerphoto.com/wp-content/uploads/2010/12/Rhapsody-of-the-Seas-Royal-Caribbean-572010-11-07-300x199.jpg" alt="" width="300" height="199"></a></p>

<p>Then there are the multitude of little cafes aboard ship, where one can indulge without incurring extra fees, as well as specialty cafes, like Ben and Jerry’s ice cream shops, for example, where you pay extra. And again, there are the free midnight buffets or “Chocolate Extravaganzas,” where even sniffing the decadent desserts concocted by the pastry chefs can cost you boku calories.</p>

<p><a href="http://blog.lesterpickerphoto.com/wp-content/uploads/2010/12/Rhapsody-of-the-Seas-Royal-Caribbean-282010-11-07.jpg"><img class="size-medium wp-image-789" title="Rhapsody of the Seas-Royal Caribbean 282010-11-07" src="http://blog.lesterpickerphoto.com/wp-content/uploads/2010/12/Rhapsody-of-the-Seas-Royal-Caribbean-282010-11-07-300x199.jpg" alt="" width="300" height="199"></a></p>

<p>On our latest cruise, for example, the ship’s kitchen staff served 120,000 meals to 2,000 people and went through 48,000 eggs. I watched grown people pile four and five desserts on their plates, like Mom wasn’t watching. Of course most passengers exhibit restraint… many do… at least some do… but it is tempting, no doubt.</p>

<h3>Bingo!?</h3>


<p>Another observation- and here I’m just curious… really!- but wouldn’t you think there were better things to do on a cruise than play Bingo for hours at a time? Yet that’s a big draw aboard ship (and big money-maker for the cruise lines). People typically wait in long lines to buy their cards, and then crowd into a lounge to play. I’ve got nothing against Bingo, but onboard ship? I suppose it’s just a way that many people let down their hair and have fun. Please enlighten me here if I’m missing some larger picture. Seriously.</p>

<p>So, what tips and recommendations can I make to those of you contemplating your first cruise (or even seasoned travelers wanting to try something different)?</p>

<h3>Learn Something New</h3>


<p>First, why not attend some of the informational presentations by the lecturers hired by the cruise ship companies? Their presentations vary, of course, from downright boring to exciting (of course mine fall into the latter category). But I can’t help but think that giving up a Bingo game or the Biggest Stomach contest (for real!) for a chance at learning something new is worth it.</p>

<p><a href="http://blog.lesterpickerphoto.com/wp-content/uploads/2010/12/cruise-lecture_2010-10-28_667%C2%A9LesterPicker.jpg"><img class="size-medium wp-image-793" title="cruise lecture_2010-10-28_667©LesterPicker" src="http://blog.lesterpickerphoto.com/wp-content/uploads/2010/12/cruise-lecture_2010-10-28_667%C2%A9LesterPicker-300x225.jpg" alt="" width="300" height="225"></a></p>

<p>Cruise ships are also great places to learn to dance or to try a new craft, all of which are offered onboard. Want to learn how to fold towels into animal shapes? They actually offer lessons on most cruise ships. So far I’ve managed to resist that one, but it might be cool for a family with young children.</p>

<h3>Treat Yourself</h3>


<p>Cruise ships also have some excellent exercise and spa facilities. The gym is free, but there are also specialty programs that allow the cruise line to earn extra bucks. The spa is also extra, but the prices are not unreasonable. Massages, for example, are competitively priced with any day spa.</p>

<p>I’ve got to say that it’s always an extra kick for me to work out while at sea. The gyms on every ship I’ve sailed on have wraparound windows, so the views are priceless. I once saw some whales cavorting as I climbed Mt. Everest on the treadmill (well, that’s what it felt like!).</p>

<h3>Make Friends</h3>


<p>Cruising is a great way to make friends. On every cruise we’ve been on, there are passengers who eat only at the buffet or in the dining room at a table for two, for the entire trip. Why not try sitting at a table for eight and meet some fascinating people? If you don’t get along with your companions, simply ask the maitre de to transfer tables. My wife and I have made some wonderful friends that way (here’s a shout-out to Mario, Glennis, Bill and Lisa, our amazing Aussie table companions!).</p>

<h3>Get Out!</h3>


<p>Believe it or not, many passengers choose to stay onboard when the ship stops in port, perhaps for financial or health reasons, which I certainly can understand. But the sheer number of people who remain onboard couldn’t possibly all be in bad health or financially destitute, unless they played too much Bingo or logged in too many pulls on the slot handle.</p>

<p>Ports of call present a terrific opportunity to see new sites, expose oneself to different people and cultures, tease your taste buds with exotic spices, or just find a remote beach where you can relax. I heartily recommend either booking on the ship tours or hiring a taxi for the day (make sure you get back at least an hour before the ship is set to sail).</p>

<h3>Get in!</h3>


<p>Take advantage of the many shows and performances offered on every cruise ship. I am almost always impressed by the amount of talent shown by the performers, some of whom go on to careers on Broadway and other competitive venues.</p>

<p>The onboard shows have only improved in recent years, as competition for passengers has intensified. There are musicals, Broadway-type mini-shows, dancers, magicians, acrobats, singers, orchestras. On our last cruise we watched, spellbound, as an eastern European couple danced a modern ballet routine accompanied by music and a video that was evocative and highly emotional. The combination of fluid movement and incredible strength was mesmerizing. I’m not saying that every show is world-class, but enough are to warrant getting to the theater early.</p>

<h3>Get Real!</h3>


<p>If you are still a working stiff, there may be times during your cruise when you simply have to get some work done. Or maybe not. Maybe you just want to read quietly. I’ll admit I’m one of those who logs in some work time while under sail and I have to say that the view from the office can’t be beat.</p>

<p><a href="http://blog.lesterpickerphoto.com/wp-content/uploads/2010/12/Rhapsody-of-the-Seas-Royal-Caribbean-192010-11-07.jpg"><img class="size-medium wp-image-790" title="Rhapsody of the Seas-Royal Caribbean 192010-11-07" src="http://blog.lesterpickerphoto.com/wp-content/uploads/2010/12/Rhapsody-of-the-Seas-Royal-Caribbean-192010-11-07-300x199.jpg" alt="" width="300" height="199"></a></p>

<p>Imagine reading on deck, with a cool (or warm) breeze gently blowing as you sail past tropical islands. Or imagine finding a shady spot on deck to open your laptop and send some emails to family or colleagues.</p>

<p>Every ship has a library, too, so on bad weather days it’s a great retreat. Quiet lounges are also good for getting some work done. My intention is not to encourage you workaholics out there, but simply to point out that one can get some serious work done if needed.</p>

<p>In any event, I have found the cruise experience to be far different than my pre-cruising biased assumptions. In fact, I find cruises fun, relaxing and rejuvenating. Oh, and did I mention the food?</p>

		  <div class="entry-content"><p>As I mentioned in a previous blog (<a href="http://blog.lesterpickerphoto.com/2010/11/28/te-anau-new-zealand/">http://blog.lesterpickerphoto.com/2010/11/28/te-anau-new-zealand/</a>), Te Anau is a wonderful small town situated on the shores of Lake Te Anau. It is blessed to sit on the eastern side of the mountain chain that affords it protection from the winds and storms that blow in from the Tasmanian Sea.</p>

<p><a href="http://blog.lesterpickerphoto.com/wp-content/uploads/2010/12/Lake-Te-Anau-South-Island-New-Zealand-282010-11-16.jpg"><img class="size-medium wp-image-775" title="Lake Te Anau, South Island, New Zealand 282010-11-16" src="http://blog.lesterpickerphoto.com/wp-content/uploads/2010/12/Lake-Te-Anau-South-Island-New-Zealand-282010-11-16-300x199.jpg" alt="" width="300" height="199"></a></p>

<p>It’s hard for me to absorb the following statistics: rainfall in the foothills on the southeast side of Lake  Manapouri, just east of the mountain range averages about 1 meter (39 inches) a year. That’s a reasonable amount of rain, comparable to the 40 inches of rain that falls in my home state of Maryland. But on the northwest shore of Lake Manapouri, where our boat just dropped us off, rainfall averages three meters a year (117 inches)!</p>

<h3>A Beautiful Sound</h3>


<p>Now our rickety bus is taking us along a narrow, winding gravel road that climbs those mountains- the only road available- and after 30 minutes our small group find itself on the shores of Doubtful Sound, so named by Captain Cook in 1770 because of its forbidding navigation. Without exaggeration, it is one of the most spectacular places I have ever been, with its deep fiords and towering peaks. It looks every bit like the rain forest that it is, but it takes an average of seven to nine meters of rain a year to maintain that botanical diversity! That’s meters, as in 39 inches to a meter, or 275-350 inches of rain falling on average for 225 days a year. That is a whole lot of rain! And, man, are we in the midst of it!</p>

<p><a href="http://blog.lesterpickerphoto.com/wp-content/uploads/2010/12/Milford-Sound-South-Island-New-Zealand-442010-11-15.jpg"><img class="size-medium wp-image-776" title="Milford Sound, South Island, New Zealand 442010-11-15" src="http://blog.lesterpickerphoto.com/wp-content/uploads/2010/12/Milford-Sound-South-Island-New-Zealand-442010-11-15-300x199.jpg" alt="" width="300" height="199"></a></p>

<p>Te Anau is the launching point for trips to nearby Milford and Doubtful Sounds. These trips can be one-day affairs or multi-day excursions. The Doubtful Sound excursion involves taking a bus from Te Anau to Manapouri, then a 45-minute boat ride across the lake and then another bus up and over the mountains, before dropping steeply to Doubtful Sound and the boat you will call home for a few hours, or possibly two or more days. Companies like Real Journeys (<a href="http://www.realjourneys.co.nz">www.realjourneys.co.nz</a>) and Fiordland Cruises (<a href="http://www.doubtfulsound.com">http://www.doubtfulsound.com</a>/) offer these not-to-be-missed packages (there are other outfitters, too). In Te Anau, Real Journeys is the heavyweight adventure outfitter, with a wider selection of activities and larger boats, while Fiordland and its cousins offer smaller boats and more intimate experiences.</p>

<p>I chose Real Journeys for two of my three Sound experiences; a one-day cruise on Milford Sound and a half-day trip to the Glowworm Caves.</p>

<p>Milford Sound receives the lion’s share of the attention when visitors consider cruising on a fiord. But, in my opinion, Doubtful Sound is far more spectacular, although less predictable weather-wise. On our two-day Doubtful Sound cruise, we enjoyed the area’s reputation for liquid sunshine to the tune of non-stop rain, day and night without letup. Still one cannot help but be awed by the natural splendor of these fiords.</p>

<p>Our one-day Milford Sound excursion was no different, with rain seriously curtailing my photography. It’s one thing to photograph in the rain, it’s another to do so on a moving, pitching and yawing small boat with the wind blowing. Frustrating, yes, but the purpose of the trip was more to scout out locations for our intended 3-month return visit in 2012-2013. This time I’ll plan to visit closer to summer. BTW, I’ll also be offering some exciting photography workshops at that time, so contact me to be placed on my list if you are interested.</p>

<h3>A Glowing Experience</h3>


<p>One of the highlights of our stay in Te Anau, was our half-day visit to the Glowworm caves on the north shore of Lake Te Anau. A 30-minute Real Journeys boat trip took us to a docking facility for the caves. We sat through a short video presentation and then were escorted as part of a small group into the cave itself.</p>

<p>Cave is a bit of a misnomer in this case. The Glowworm cave is part of a labyrinthine system of caves, some four miles long and cascading through four levels. Visitors may only access the Glowworm caves, located at the lower end of what is known as the Aurora Caves, and at another site on the upper end.</p>

<p>As a former biologist I was absolutely captivated by this cave and the way in which it has been packaged, with respect for the fragile environment. We entered as part of a 14-person group. The cave system is huge, with a raging river thundering through it. Catwalks allow visitors to walk through, every bend and turn more fascinating then the last. At one point you come to a waterfall roaring down a wall and into a pool.</p>

<h3>Glowworms: A Biological Phenomenon</h3>


<p>And then, you come to the glowworms. My biological curiosity was peaked by these amazing creatures that are actually the larval stage of a fly. They create long mucous tubes within which thy crawl so they are not desiccated. From these tubes they suspend sticky mucous strings with title droplets that look like jewels. They then turn on a tiny bioluminescent light located near its tail, which attracts insects that the larvae use as food. At one point in the cave all 14 people silently board a boat that is hand-pulled to the middle of a grotto. It is pitch dark and suddenly you look up and see a constellation of glowworm ‘stars’ that has everyone gasping.</p>

<p>Everyone, that is, except for the insensitive moron sitting behind me who whispered to his young son: “Hey, this is what they’re making such a big deal about?” I guess he was hoping for “It’s a Small World After All” and a fireworks display. Go figure.</p>

<p>Te Anau is the launching point for trips to nearby Milford and Doubtful Sounds. These trips can be one-day affairs or multi-day excursions. The Doubtful Sound excursion involves taking a bus from Te Anau to Manapouri, then a 45-minute boat ride across the lake and then another bus up and over the mountains, before dropping steeply to Doubtful Sound and the boat you will call home for a few hours, or possibly two or more days. Companies like Real Journeys (<a href="http://www.realjourneys.co.nz">www.realjourneys.co.nz</a>) and Fiordland Cruises (<a href="http://www.doubtfulsound.com">http://www.doubtfulsound.com</a>/) offer these not-to-be-missed packages (there are other outfitters, too).</p>

<p>In Te Anau, Real Journeys is the heavyweight adventure outfitter, with a wider selection of activities and larger boats, while Fiordland and its cousins offer smaller boats and more intimate experiences.  I chose Real Journeys for two of my three Sound experiences; a one-day cruise on Milford Sound and a half-day trip to the Glowworm Caves.  Milford Sound receives the lion’s share of the attention when visitors consider cruising on a fiord. But, in my opinion, Doubtful Sound is far more spectacular, although less predictable weather-wise.</p>

<p>On our two-day Doubtful Sound cruise, we enjoyed the area’s reputation for liquid sunshine to the tune of non-stop rain, day and night without letup. Still one cannot help but be awed by the natural splendor of these fiords.  Our one-day Milford Sound excursion was no different, with rain seriously curtailing my photography. It’s one thing to photograph in the rain, it’s another to do so on a moving, pitching and yawing small boat with the wind blowing. Frustrating, yes, but the purpose of the trip was more to scout out locations for our intended 3-month return visit in 2012-2013. This time I’ll plan to visit closer to summer. BTW, I’ll also be offering some exciting photography workshops at that time, so <em>contact me to be placed on my list</em> if you are interested.</p>

<h3>A Glowing Experience</h3>


<p>One of the highlights of our stay in Te Anau, was our half-day visit to the Glowworm caves on the north shore of Lake Te Anau. A 30-minute Real Journeys boat trip took us to a docking facility for the caves. We sat through a short video presentation and then were escorted as part of a small group into the cave itself.  Cave is a bit of a misnomer in this case. The Glowworm cave is part of a labyrinthine system of caves, some four miles long and cascading through four levels.</p>

<p>Visitors may only access the Glowworm caves, located at the lower end of what is known as the Aurora Caves, and at another site on the upper end.  As a former biologist I was absolutely captivated by this cave and the way in which it has been packaged, with respect for the fragile environment. We entered as part of a 14-person group. The cave system is huge, with a raging river thundering through it. Catwalks allow visitors to walk through, every bend and turn more fascinating then the last. At one point you come to a waterfall roaring down a wall and into a pool.</p>

<p><a href="http://blog.lesterpickerphoto.com/wp-content/uploads/2010/12/Glowworm-caves-Te-Anau-South-Island-New-Zealand-82010-11-161.jpg"><img class="size-medium wp-image-779" title="Glowworm caves, Te Anau, South Island, New Zealand 82010-11-16" src="http://blog.lesterpickerphoto.com/wp-content/uploads/2010/12/Glowworm-caves-Te-Anau-South-Island-New-Zealand-82010-11-161-200x300.jpg" alt="" width="200" height="300"></a></p>

<h3>Glowworms: A Biological Phenomenon</h3>


<p>And then, you come to the glowworms. My biological curiosity was peaked by these amazing creatures that are actually the larval stage of a fly. They create long mucous tubes within which thy crawl so they are not desiccated. From these tubes they suspend sticky mucous strings with title droplets that look like jewels. They then turn on a tiny bioluminescent light located near its tail, which attracts insects that the larvae use as food.</p>

<p><a href="http://blog.lesterpickerphoto.com/wp-content/uploads/2010/12/Glowworm-caves-Te-Anau-South-Island-New-Zealand-242010-11-16.jpg"><img class="size-medium wp-image-780" title="Glowworm caves, Te Anau, South Island, New Zealand 242010-11-16" src="http://blog.lesterpickerphoto.com/wp-content/uploads/2010/12/Glowworm-caves-Te-Anau-South-Island-New-Zealand-242010-11-16-300x200.jpg" alt="" width="300" height="200"></a></p>

<p>At one point in the cave all 14 people silently board a boat that is hand-pulled to the middle of a grotto. It is pitch dark and suddenly you look up and see a constellation of glowworm ‘stars’ that has everyone gasping.</p>

<p>Everyone, that is, except for the insensitive moron sitting behind me who whispered to his young son: “Hey, this is what they’re making such a big deal about?” I guess he was hoping for “It’s a Small World After All” and a fireworks display. Go figure.</p>

		  <div class="entry-content"><p>There is a village in this small corner of Vanuatu, where several years ago a group of indigenous people came together to discuss a plague that threatened to destroy them. Their children were being abducted by corporate marketers hawking products irrelevant to their preferred way of life. Their people were abandoning centuries old values, ones that uniquely defined them. In short, they were in danger of losing their culture, yet another victim of the relentless spread of western consumerism.</p>

<p>They talked, they debated and they listened as a community, and in the end they made a daring decision. They would abandon the trappings of modern society and embrace the ways of old. They formed Ekasup Village, just outside of Port Vila.</p>

<p><a href="http://blog.lesterpickerphoto.com/wp-content/uploads/2010/11/Ekasup-Village-Port-Vila-Fiji-1002010-11-04.jpg"><img class="size-medium wp-image-749" title="Ekasup Village, Port Vila, Fiji 1002010-11-04" src="http://blog.lesterpickerphoto.com/wp-content/uploads/2010/11/Ekasup-Village-Port-Vila-Fiji-1002010-11-04-200x300.jpg" alt="" width="200" height="300"></a></p>

<h3><strong><em>Ekasup Village As a Tourist Venue</em></strong></h3>


<p>It’s hard to describe Ekasup Village. On its face, it is an educational facility designed to give tourists a real taste of traditional island life, prior to Western influences. To that end they do a marvelous job.</p>

<p>Each small group of tourists are greeted by a professional guide who is a village resident. They are then led through parts of the village, where residents dressed in traditional garb demonstrate various crafts and natural medicines and staple foods. There is also a singing and dancing demonstration at the outdoor community meeting spot, a semi-circular lava stone, open air facility painstakingly built by the residents.</p>

<p>The nominal cost of the tour, $20 USD, is worth every penny as everyone who I spoke to attested. Children enjoyed the dancing, singing, demonstrations and samples of traditional foods.</p>

<h3><strong><em>The &#8216;Real&#8217; Ekasup Village</em></strong></h3>


<p>But Ekasup Village is far more than its face. Behind the very effective attempt to educate, there exists the reality of village life. Ekasup is actually home to approximately 60 families comprising 500 individuals. Started in 1996, the village was completed in 2001, although improvements continue. Residents agree to live as did their ancestors. There are no watches, telephones, radios, televisions or other electronics in the village.</p>

<p>The village has its own school and the villagers own the land which traverses Erakor rain forest and winds down a hillside to the shore.</p>

<p><a href="http://blog.lesterpickerphoto.com/wp-content/uploads/2010/11/Ekasup-Village-Port-Vila-Fiji-712010-11-04.jpg"><img class="size-medium wp-image-750" title="Ekasup Village, Port Vila, Fiji 712010-11-04" src="http://blog.lesterpickerphoto.com/wp-content/uploads/2010/11/Ekasup-Village-Port-Vila-Fiji-712010-11-04-199x300.jpg" alt="" width="199" height="300"></a></p>

<p>Sifo, the adult son of the tribal chief, served as my guide and admirably tolerated my incessant questions. At one point he introduced us to his youngest son, who is learning the traditional ways from his father and the village elders.</p>

<p><a href="http://blog.lesterpickerphoto.com/wp-content/uploads/2010/11/Ekasup-Village-Port-Vila-Fiji-972010-11-04.jpg"><img class="size-medium wp-image-751" title="Ekasup Village, Port Vila, Fiji 972010-11-04" src="http://blog.lesterpickerphoto.com/wp-content/uploads/2010/11/Ekasup-Village-Port-Vila-Fiji-972010-11-04-200x300.jpg" alt="" width="200" height="300"></a></p>

<p>The village includes a magnificent ficus tree, used by the ancient villagers as a shelter from monsoons.</p>

<p><a href="http://blog.lesterpickerphoto.com/wp-content/uploads/2010/11/Ekasup-Village-Port-Vila-Fiji-332010-11-04.jpg"><img class="size-medium wp-image-752" title="Ekasup Village, Port Vila, Fiji 332010-11-04" src="http://blog.lesterpickerphoto.com/wp-content/uploads/2010/11/Ekasup-Village-Port-Vila-Fiji-332010-11-04-200x300.jpg" alt="" width="200" height="300"></a></p>

<p>When they are not educating tourists about their culture, the residents are free to do as they like. Some fish, others tend gardens, and just about everyone naps during rainy weather in the off-season. The spiritual practices of residents runs the gamut from plain vanilla Christianity to traditional animist practices.</p>

<p><a href="http://blog.lesterpickerphoto.com/wp-content/uploads/2010/11/Ekasup-Village-Port-Vila-Fiji-232010-11-04.jpg"><img class="size-medium wp-image-753 " title="Ekasup Village, Port Vila, Fiji 232010-11-04" src="http://blog.lesterpickerphoto.com/wp-content/uploads/2010/11/Ekasup-Village-Port-Vila-Fiji-232010-11-04-200x300.jpg" alt="" width="200" height="300"></a></p>

<h3><strong><em>A Special Gift</em></strong></h3>


<p>An interesting side note is that my wife and I were abandoned by our taxi driver, who dropped us off at the village and then disappeared. As a result we had to spend extra time at the village, one of those true gifts that happens when you are flexible enough to go with the flow. The extra time we had allowed us to learn more about this tribal culture and to enjoy the company of our the village residents. One of the more interesting cultural practices involves the use of chicken feathers in the headdress of the men. The feathers represent the colors of their pigs and the more ornate the feathering, the more impressive their pig holdings. This serves to advertise the status of the single males during tribal gatherings, when eligible women will be present.</p>

<p>If your travel plans include Vanuatu, be sure to carve out time for this excellent educational experience.</p>

		  <div class="entry-content"><p>Since I&#8217;ve been a child, I imagined being in New Zealand. When I watched Peter Jackson&#8217;s Lord of the Rings, spellbound, the child within was awakened. And so, here I am. No book, no documentary, indeed not even The Lord of the Rings, could have prepared me for the reality of New Zealand. It is stunning, the penultimate eye candy, an unending visual spectacle that boggles the mind.</p>

<h3><strong>From Christchurch to Fiordland</strong></h3>


<p>We left Christchurch (see <a href="http://blog.lesterpickerphoto.com/2010/11/20/alive-and-well-in-christchurch/">http://blog.lesterpickerphoto.com/2010/11/20/alive-and-well-in-christchurch/</a>) heading toward Fiordland National Park, on a mission to scout out the South Island for our long-term return visit in 2012-13. Heading southwest,  we travelled through a rich, green tapestry of agricultural fields. The landscape changes gradually from totally flat to hilly, with tens of thousands of sheep grazing contentedly, forming a picturesque pastoral scene. (Factoid: NZ has 40 million sheep, or ten sheep for every resident.)</p>

<p><a href="http://blog.lesterpickerphoto.com/wp-content/uploads/2010/11/South-Island-New-Zealand-112010-11-19.jpg"><img class="size-medium wp-image-740" title="South Island, New Zealand 112010-11-19" src="http://blog.lesterpickerphoto.com/wp-content/uploads/2010/11/South-Island-New-Zealand-112010-11-19-300x199.jpg" alt="" width="300" height="199"></a></p>

<p>New Zealanders, surprisingly to me,  also raise enormous numbers of deer for the world venison market.</p>

<p><a href="http://blog.lesterpickerphoto.com/wp-content/uploads/2010/11/New-Zealand-road-to-Te-Anau-342010-11-14.jpg"><img class="size-medium wp-image-741" title="New Zealand, road to Te Anau 342010-11-14" src="http://blog.lesterpickerphoto.com/wp-content/uploads/2010/11/New-Zealand-road-to-Te-Anau-342010-11-14-300x200.jpg" alt="" width="300" height="200"></a></p>

<h3><strong>Lake Tekapo</strong></h3>


<p>We were headed seven hours away, for Lake Tekapo (pronounced tee&#8217;-kah-poe) where I intended to become the umpteen millionth photographer to capture the Church of the Good Shepard, which is perched on a small rise along the shore of the Lake, encircled by a chain of snow-capped mountains in the distance.</p>

<p>As Robert Burns said; &#8220;The best laid schemes o&#8217; mice and men, gang aft agley.&#8221; I set up my tripod and camera well before sunset and promptly faced gale-force winds and light drizzle. Photographers can take, and may even welcome, a gentle rain, but wind is our enemy in most cases (unless you&#8217;re Darwin Wiggett, a photographer I greatly admire&#8230; see my links for his website).</p>

<p>I had a mental image of the shots I had wanted to take, but after a couple of hours on site, I came away disappointed, but knowing for sure how I want to shoot the scene in a couple of years, weather permitting. I&#8217;ll plan to spend a few days in the area to increase my chances of better weather.</p>

<p><a href="http://blog.lesterpickerphoto.com/wp-content/uploads/2010/11/Tekapo-New-Zealand-442010-11-13.jpg"><img class="size-medium wp-image-742" title="Tekapo, New Zealand 442010-11-13" src="http://blog.lesterpickerphoto.com/wp-content/uploads/2010/11/Tekapo-New-Zealand-442010-11-13-300x199.jpg" alt="" width="300" height="199"></a></p>

<p>After a rainy night in Lake Tekapo, we left for Te Anau, the staging town for entry into the wild, undeveloped Fiordland National park. Here lie the iconic NZ landscapes: Milford Sound, Doubtful Sound and the dozens of other coastal sounds that have kept maritime explorers and present-day hikers busy investigating their mysterious beauty for hundreds of years.</p>

<h3><strong>A Lovely Inn in a Wonderful Town</strong></h3>


<p>Te Anau is a lovely small town, situated as it is along the southeast shore of picturesque Lake Te Anau.   On a whim I had booked us into Dock Bay Lodge, a relatively new property purpose-built as an inn by its owners, Dawn and Mark Dowling. This was only the second instance on our month-long adventure in Australia, New Zealand, Fiji and New Caledonia where the reality of our lodging far surpassed our expectations, a rarity as any travel writer will tell you.</p>

<p><a href="http://blog.lesterpickerphoto.com/wp-content/uploads/2010/11/Te-Anau-New-Zealand-Dock-Bay-Lodge-22010-11-14.jpg"><img class="size-medium wp-image-743" title="Te Anau, New Zealand- Dock Bay Lodge 22010-11-14" src="http://blog.lesterpickerphoto.com/wp-content/uploads/2010/11/Te-Anau-New-Zealand-Dock-Bay-Lodge-22010-11-14-300x199.jpg" alt="" width="300" height="199"></a></p>

<p>Dock Bay Lodge (<a href="http://">www.dockbaylodge.co.nz</a>) overlooks Lake Te Anau on an immaculately landscaped property. The bedrooms are huge, and the ceramic tiled bathrooms modern and roomy. The communal living room sported a digital wide-screen television, a large fireplace and large, comfortable leather couches.</p>

<p>The dining room has a large table, able to accommodate the maximum of 10 guests, with floor to ceiling sliding window-doors that give a 210 degree view of the Te Anau environs.</p>

<p>But, it is what is served in this dining area that is a good indication of just how special Dock Bay is. Breakfasts include a selection of juices, yogurt, cereals- including Dawn&#8217;s special recipe muesli- and fresh fruits. There is also a selection of croissants and breads, served with your choice of specialty jams. Dawn and her assistant, Diane, will prepare a hot breakfast of eggs with all †he trimmings and porridge (what Americans call cooked oatmeal).</p>

<p>Dawn and Mark are highly involved in the workings of the town and in the tourism industry. Several times during our 3-night stay I relied on her unfailing advice on what to see and do.</p>

<p>Once you check in to Dock Bay, everything is included. Your in-room refrigerator is stocked with NZ wines and beers, as well as other refreshments. Cookies are provided daily by Diane. Dawn will send you on your way with a cup of coffee or tea. Throughout the lodge Dawn&#8217;s taste is evident. The lodge is decorated so tastefully, my wife and I found ourselves just walking about admiring the artwork and furnishings.</p>

<p>Dawn and Mark are warm, welcoming and gracious hosts, so if you find yourself planning a Kiwi visit, you might want to try Dock Bay Lodge. If you do, be sure to let us know via this blog how your experience went.</p>

<p>In my next blog I’ll cover what there is to do and see in Te Anau, and Milford Doubtful Sounds.</p>

		  <div class="entry-content"><p>Once in a while I’m blessed with a wonderful surprise as a travel photojournalist. I get to visit a place for which I had no expectations, but which brings forth hidden jewels. That was the case when I visited Lifou, one of the Loyalty Islands in the archipelago of New Caledonia.</p>

<h3>New Caledonia: A New Future</h3>


<p>New Caledonia is currently a French protectorate, but is slated for a vote on independence in 2014. Recognizing that its future economy will, in large part, depend on tourism, the island group is busily preparing. Even tiny Lifou Island appears to be raising its profile. It recently hosted a first-ever visit from Royal Caribbean’s Rhapsody of the Seas, a 2,000-passenger vessel out of Sydney, Australia. I was lecturing aboard on digital photography.</p>

<p>Disgorging two thousand people onto an island that does not even have a docking facility (passengers had to be tendered in) is no small task. And, to be sure the islanders were overwhelmed. Yet one would be hard pressed to find more friendly people, willing to accommodate tourists in whatever way they can. The indigenous people greeted us with a colorful and melodic singing and dancing troupe, using hand-pads made of coconut hemp to produce percussion sounds.</p>

<p><a href="http://blog.lesterpickerphoto.com/wp-content/uploads/2010/11/Lifou-New-Caledonia-122010-11-05.jpg"><img class="size-medium wp-image-723" title="Lifou, New Caledonia 122010-11-05" src="http://blog.lesterpickerphoto.com/wp-content/uploads/2010/11/Lifou-New-Caledonia-122010-11-05-200x300.jpg" alt="" width="200" height="300"></a></p>

<p>First a bit of geography. Lifou is a classic tropical island, with miles and miles of pure white sand beaches. Its reefs are idyllic. Fish are abundant. The tropical huts that its indigenous people live in are picturesque and inviting.</p>

<p><a href="http://blog.lesterpickerphoto.com/wp-content/uploads/2010/11/Lifou-New-Caledonia-602010-11-05.jpg"><img class="size-medium wp-image-725" title="Lifou, New Caledonia 602010-11-05" src="http://blog.lesterpickerphoto.com/wp-content/uploads/2010/11/Lifou-New-Caledonia-602010-11-05-199x300.jpg" alt="" width="199" height="300"></a></p>

<p>Lifou also sports caves, picturesque cliffs and gorgeous coves. I spent a lovely few hours prowling the coastline and photographing, although the day was overcast.</p>

<p><a href="http://blog.lesterpickerphoto.com/wp-content/uploads/2010/11/Lifou-New-Caledonia-1152010-11-05.jpg"><img class="size-medium wp-image-724" title="Lifou, New Caledonia 1152010-11-05" src="http://blog.lesterpickerphoto.com/wp-content/uploads/2010/11/Lifou-New-Caledonia-1152010-11-05-199x300.jpg" alt="" width="199" height="300"></a></p>

<h3>The Vanilla Farm Experience</h3>


<p>My wife and I were about to hike the mile back to the ship, when a battered red pickup truck turned into the gravel road we were walking. A man was driving, his wife next to him and two adorable children in the back. We waved hello and they stopped and tried talking to us. Our French is nonexistent, as was their English, yet we were able to communicate. That’s probably one of my favorite activities when I travel; trying to form a human-to-human bond despite the chasm of culture and language. In this case we succeeded and Jacob managed to convey to us an invitation to visit his vanilla bean farm, mostly through his ten-year old son who knew a few English words and expressions. The farm was only a hundred yards down the road.</p>

<p>And what a time we had! For the next hour, Jacob, his wife/partner Leila and their two children, Lorenzo and Maria gave us a tour of their farm, known as The Vanilleraie. Jacob and his family were filled with pride as they showed us how vanilla beans are grown.</p>

<p><a href="http://blog.lesterpickerphoto.com/wp-content/uploads/2010/11/Lifou-New-Caledonia-1382010-11-05.jpg"><img class="size-medium wp-image-726 " title="Lifou, New Caledonia 1382010-11-05" src="http://blog.lesterpickerphoto.com/wp-content/uploads/2010/11/Lifou-New-Caledonia-1382010-11-05-300x199.jpg" alt="" width="300" height="199"></a></p>

<p>The care they take with their plants is evident. Every plant is carefully manicured and cultivated. Each plant is mulched with coconut shells, since the coconut palm grows wild throughout the island and on Jacob’s and Leila’s property. So nothing is wasted, Jacob and his son feed the coconut meat to their pigs.</p>

<p>It was hot and steamy out, but that was the last thing on our minds as we admired the farm they had carved out of the tropical jungle. At the end of the visit Jacob opened a weather-beaten suitcase and showed us the crown jewel of his operation; probably several hundred now dried and brown vanilla beans. My, god, what an intoxicating smell wafted to us when he opened that suitcase! He offered us some as a gift, but we tried to explain to him that we were not allowed to take any plants or foods back to the ship. He looked disappointed- and probably thought we were nuts- but I hope he understood. As soon as I get back to the States, I’ll send photos of the family back to them.</p>

<p><a href="http://blog.lesterpickerphoto.com/wp-content/uploads/2010/11/Lifou-New-Caledonia-1912010-11-05.jpg"><img class="size-medium wp-image-727   " title="Lifou, New Caledonia 1912010-11-05" src="http://blog.lesterpickerphoto.com/wp-content/uploads/2010/11/Lifou-New-Caledonia-1912010-11-05-200x300.jpg" alt="" width="130" height="194"></a></p>

<p>If you ever do get to Lifou, make The Vanilleraie a must-see stop, especially if you speak French.</p>

		  <div class="entry-content"><h3>What Earthquake?</h3>


<p>New Zealand is subject to earthquakes&#8230; lots of them. But after the recent earthquake tragedy in Christchurch, New Zealand, I’m convinced that the media whipped it into a distorted frenzy. Yes, one person died several days later of a heart attack. But the devastation I witnessed while here is nowhere near as bad as I had imagined.</p>

<p><a href="http://blog.lesterpickerphoto.com/wp-content/uploads/2010/11/Christchurch-South-Island-New-Zealand-852010-11-20.jpg"><img class="size-medium wp-image-711" title="Christchurch, South Island, New Zealand 852010-11-20" src="http://blog.lesterpickerphoto.com/wp-content/uploads/2010/11/Christchurch-South-Island-New-Zealand-852010-11-20-300x199.jpg" alt="" width="300" height="199"></a></p>

<p>To be sure, there are buildings down and repair work going on in the downtown business areas. There are regular aftershocks, and we felt a slight tremor at 10:30 at night on our second night in the city (only a 3.5 on the Richter scale, thankfully). But on the whole Christchurch is alive and vibrant, with a marvelous restaurant scene and arts venues citywide.</p>

<p>First a couple of our favorites to place in your file for future reference. I won’t get into lots of detail here (I’ll save that for my magazine writing&#8230; which reminds me&#8230; that’s another reason to register on this site&#8230; I’ll let you know whenever my writing appears in print). As is true virtually everywhere in NZ, prices are generally high. But we did find some exceptional values and fun activities. I also wanted to share a photo insight with you.</p>

<h3>Some Exciting Eateries</h3>


<p>If you are staying anywhere near the city center, do consider a walk to the Addington section on Lincoln Road and spend an pleasurable breakfast hour at the Addington Coffee Co-op, where you’ll enjoy organic, fair-traded coffee, loose-leaf teas, and scrumptious breakfast offerings. I had an amazing smoked salmon and cream cheese rolled in an egg omelette, with a side fresh fruit salad. My wife feasted on a dark raisin bread with other dried fruits in it, along with ricotta cheese and jam spread. She was in heaven. The ambience is of an old coffee house, like Starbucks before it became the corporate STARBUCKS. The tab was $25.30 NZ dollars, but discount that by around 25% for the favorable exchange rate.</p>

<p>For lunches and dinners, there is a wide variety of options in Christchurch, encompassing every ethnic food imaginable. We tried a very plain looking Chinese restaurant called Sampan, on the corner of Columbo and Tuam Roads. This family-run restaurant surprised us with generous plates of seafood and fresh vegetables, rice and mini spring rolls. Total tab was $20 NZ dollars, although we actually split the dish because the portions were so large.</p>

<p><a href="http://blog.lesterpickerphoto.com/wp-content/uploads/2010/11/Christchurch-South-Island-New-Zealand-902010-11-20.jpg"><img class="size-medium wp-image-712" title="Christchurch, South Island, New Zealand 902010-11-20" src="http://blog.lesterpickerphoto.com/wp-content/uploads/2010/11/Christchurch-South-Island-New-Zealand-902010-11-20-300x199.jpg" alt="" width="300" height="199"></a></p>

<h3>The Christchurch Arts Scene</h3>


<p>The arts scene appears quite vibrant all over NZ, but especially in Oamaru ( a small town south of Christchurch) and in Christchurch itself. We had a lovely time in Christchurch at The Arts Centre, a repurposed church building that houses dozens of arts and crafts shops, including several that offer original Maori art. There is a fine cafe located on the second floor with nice views of the tree-lined area.</p>

<p><a href="http://blog.lesterpickerphoto.com/wp-content/uploads/2010/11/Christchurch-South-Island-New-Zealand-992010-11-20.jpg"><img class="aligncenter size-medium wp-image-713" title="Christchurch, South Island, New Zealand 992010-11-20" src="http://blog.lesterpickerphoto.com/wp-content/uploads/2010/11/Christchurch-South-Island-New-Zealand-992010-11-20-300x199.jpg" alt="" width="300" height="199"></a></p>

<p>Diagonally across the street from The Arts Centre is the Christchurch Art Gallery, a light-filled art museum offering an eclectic mix of artists and styles. We felt very fortunate to have Ron Mueck’s art on display as a major exhibit. His work has drawn major attention and kudos in the art world. Perhaps you’ve seen his larger than life size sculptures that look so real you’d swear the sculpture will get up to shift positions in just a moment. While admission to the museum is free, the Mueck exhibit was $15.00 per adult extra, and worth every penny.</p>

<p><a href="http://blog.lesterpickerphoto.com/wp-content/uploads/2010/11/Christchurch-South-Island-New-Zealand-1182010-11-20.jpg"><img class="size-medium wp-image-714" title="Christchurch, South Island, New Zealand 1182010-11-20" src="http://blog.lesterpickerphoto.com/wp-content/uploads/2010/11/Christchurch-South-Island-New-Zealand-1182010-11-20-199x300.jpg" alt="" width="199" height="300"></a></p>

<p>The center city is also packed with excellent shopping that includes a nice outdoor walking mall, as well as boutique clothing stores. At the west end of the walking mall is the Botanic Garden with the Avon River, and many young lovers, gently flowing through it.</p>

<p><a href="http://blog.lesterpickerphoto.com/wp-content/uploads/2010/11/Christchurch-South-Island-New-Zealand-252010-11-20.jpg"><img class="size-medium wp-image-715" title="Christchurch, South Island, New Zealand 252010-11-20" src="http://blog.lesterpickerphoto.com/wp-content/uploads/2010/11/Christchurch-South-Island-New-Zealand-252010-11-20-300x200.jpg" alt="" width="300" height="200"></a></p>

<h3>An Important Photography Lesson</h3>


<p>Now for the photo lesson. The weather in Christchurch when we were there was drizzly, with gray, featureless skies, in short a photographer’s nightmare. Rain is okay. Dark, angry clouds are even better. But gray skies are yucky and can turn a good image into pablum faster than you can squeeze the shutter. So what’s a photographer to do?</p>

<p><a href="http://blog.lesterpickerphoto.com/wp-content/uploads/2010/11/Christchurch-South-Island-New-Zealand-502010-11-20.jpg"><img class="size-medium wp-image-716" title="Christchurch, South Island, New Zealand 502010-11-20" src="http://blog.lesterpickerphoto.com/wp-content/uploads/2010/11/Christchurch-South-Island-New-Zealand-502010-11-20-200x300.jpg" alt="" width="200" height="300"></a></p>

<p>I am already working on a blog that will explain this in depth, but for now suffice it to say that you need to instead focus on tight scenes which do not include the sky. We call these extraction shots, because you are extracting one element to emphasize from a more detailed scene. It limits your photography in some ways, but opens infinite creative possibilities in other ways. Look for my upcoming blog on the topic and then try it out yourself.</p>

<p><a href="http://blog.lesterpickerphoto.com/wp-content/uploads/2010/11/Christchurch-South-Island-New-Zealand-652010-11-20.jpg"><img class="size-medium wp-image-717" title="Christchurch, South Island, New Zealand 652010-11-20" src="http://blog.lesterpickerphoto.com/wp-content/uploads/2010/11/Christchurch-South-Island-New-Zealand-652010-11-20-199x300.jpg" alt="" width="199" height="300"></a></p>

<p><a href="http://blog.lesterpickerphoto.com/wp-content/uploads/2010/11/Christchurch-South-Island-New-Zealand-782010-11-20.jpg"><img class="size-medium wp-image-718" title="Christchurch, South Island, New Zealand 782010-11-20" src="http://blog.lesterpickerphoto.com/wp-content/uploads/2010/11/Christchurch-South-Island-New-Zealand-782010-11-20-199x300.jpg" alt="" width="199" height="300"></a></p>

<p>NZ is far, far more than just the city of Christchurch, as we found out on my photo tour. Look for my next NZ adventures in future blogs. Until then, happy shooting!</p>

<p><strong>S</strong>ure, you may have heard of Australia’s Great Ocean Drive (if you haven’t, please see my previous blog: <a href="http://">http://blog.lesterpickerphoto.com/2010/11/12/the-great-ocean-drive-photo-valhalla/</a>), but have you heard of its Great Ocean Walk? Every so often I come up with a travel venue that I just love and want to share with my readers. This is one of them.</p>

<p><a href="http://blog.lesterpickerphoto.com/wp-content/uploads/2010/11/Great-Ocean-Road-Victoria-Australia-902010-11-09.jpg"><img class="size-medium wp-image-704" title="Great Ocean Road, Victoria, Australia 902010-11-09" src="http://blog.lesterpickerphoto.com/wp-content/uploads/2010/11/Great-Ocean-Road-Victoria-Australia-902010-11-09-300x199.jpg" alt="" width="300" height="199"></a></p>

<p>Various Aussie government agencies, nonprofit organizations and private landowners have created a fascinating, seven-day walk along the Pacific Ocean that meanders through scenery that defies description; along seaside cliffs, through cow pastures and verdant forests. The walk can be done in one weeklong trek, or in one-day or multi-day segments, conveniently divided so that you can pick up those sections you missed at a future time. Along the way are campgrounds and inns that cater to the walking crowd. The walks range from easy to moderately strenuous, depending on your age, physical condition and pace.</p>

<p><a href="http://blog.lesterpickerphoto.com/wp-content/uploads/2010/11/Bothfeet-Lodge-Victoria-Australia-92010-11-10.jpg"><img class="aligncenter size-medium wp-image-700" title="Bothfeet Lodge, Victoria, Australia 92010-11-10" src="http://blog.lesterpickerphoto.com/wp-content/uploads/2010/11/Bothfeet-Lodge-Victoria-Australia-92010-11-10-300x199.jpg" alt="" width="300" height="199"></a></p>

<h3>Using BothFeet</h3>


<p>My wife and I joined one of these walks conducted by a creative small business called Bothfeet, a dream of owners Gavin and Dana Ronan, themselves avid walkers. Bothfeet’s concept is unique in that they run an elegant lodge that caters to every whim of walkers. They offer several types of walking experiences. You can go on a guided walk for any length of days or hire one their very able guides for your private party. Or, you can just stay at the Bothfeet Lodge and take walks on your own. They will pick you up at the end of each day’s segment.</p>

<p><a href="http://blog.lesterpickerphoto.com/wp-content/uploads/2010/11/Great-Ocean-Road-Victoria-Australia-602010-11-09.jpg"><img class="size-medium wp-image-701" title="Great Ocean Road, Victoria, Australia 602010-11-09" src="http://blog.lesterpickerphoto.com/wp-content/uploads/2010/11/Great-Ocean-Road-Victoria-Australia-602010-11-09-199x300.jpg" alt="" width="199" height="300"></a></p>

<p>Waiting for you when you get back to the lodge are heated footbaths with organic salts, an indulgent and delightful experience after a good day’s walk. Best of all, while at Bothfeet you get to feast on the healthy snacks and gourmet meals of Ha Nguyen, their creative, very personable and energetic chef (and site manager).   Bothfeet (www.bothfeet.com.au/) provides all sorts of accessories for walkers to use while at the lodge, all included in the price. Need raingear? No problem. Mosquito nets, sunscreen, backpacks? All included. They also provide gators for your feet and ankles to prevent potential snakebites, which are quite rare. But, then again, Australia has more venomous than non-venomous snakes, so an ounce of prevention…</p>

<h3>From the Ground Up</h3>


<p>The entire Bothfeet facility was conceived by 38-year old Gavin and designed by an architect using eco-friendly materials and concepts. Bothfeet is presently set up for ten guests, creating a wonderfully intimate atmosphere. Future plans include expanding to accommodate a maximum of 20 visitors. The buildings are all modular and nicely appointed, with wood walkways linking all facilities.</p>

<p><a href="http://blog.lesterpickerphoto.com/wp-content/uploads/2010/11/Great-Ocean-Road-Victoria-Australia-722010-11-09.jpg"><img class="size-medium wp-image-703" title="Great Ocean Road, Victoria, Australia 722010-11-09" src="http://blog.lesterpickerphoto.com/wp-content/uploads/2010/11/Great-Ocean-Road-Victoria-Australia-722010-11-09-199x300.jpg" alt="" width="199" height="300"></a></p>

<p>On our first afternoon at Bothfeet, we walked along highlands that paralleled a picturesque stretch of the ocean, from Aire River Valley to Johanna Beach, a distance of perhaps 7 kilometers. Our knowledgeable guide, Marie Killeen, pointed out items of interest, from Aboriginal medicinal plants to the story of shipwrecks that occurred just offshore from where our feet were planted. Walkers encounter some of Australia’s iconic wildlife, like kangaroos, wallabies and koalas, with Marie providing a naturalist’s commentary. Luscious and nutritious lunches are prepared and packed by Ha and happily consumed by hungry walkers.</p>

<p><a href="http://blog.lesterpickerphoto.com/wp-content/uploads/2010/11/Great-Ocean-Road-Victoria-Australia-382010-11-09.jpg"><img class="size-medium wp-image-702" title="Great Ocean Road, Victoria, Australia 382010-11-09" src="http://blog.lesterpickerphoto.com/wp-content/uploads/2010/11/Great-Ocean-Road-Victoria-Australia-382010-11-09-199x300.jpg" alt="" width="199" height="300"></a></p>

<p>If you are interested in an active vacation and want an incredible walking-lodging experience I heartily recommend a stay at Bothfeet. If you do, please come back here to share your experiences with our blog readers.</p>

		  <div class="entry-content"><h3>The Great Ocean Drive</h3>


<p>There are just a handful of iconic scenic drives in this world. One, of course, is Highway 1 along California’s northern coast. Others include Ocean Drive in Acadia National Park, and the spectacular Road to Hana on the island of Maui.  Add to that Australia’s Great Ocean Road, a jaw-dropping drive starting southwest of Melbourne and continuing west to Port Campbell and beyond.</p>

<p>As part of my current photo adventure (future photo travel workshop anyone?), I got to spend several days along Australia’s Great Ocean Road. It’s a marvel of engineering, with backdrop courtesy of Mother Nature.</p>

<p><a href="http://blog.lesterpickerphoto.com/wp-content/uploads/2010/11/Great-Ocean-Road-Victoria-Australia-2402010-11-11.jpg"><img class="size-medium wp-image-692" title="Great Ocean Road, Victoria, Australia 2402010-11-11" src="http://blog.lesterpickerphoto.com/wp-content/uploads/2010/11/Great-Ocean-Road-Victoria-Australia-2402010-11-11-200x300.jpg" alt="" width="200" height="300"></a></p>

<p>The Great Ocean Road is easy to access from Melbourne. It’s a smooth highway jaunt (except for rush hours) along the west side of Melbourne with possibilities of joining the road at its far eastern section or at the more popular slightly more western start. Remember that everything is marked in kilometers, one of which is 6/10 of a mile, so the distance is not as far as it first appears. BTW, the Aussies drive on the left, so if you drive please do so leisurely until you’re acclimated.   Actually, you’d have to drive leisurely.</p>

<h3>Unparalleled Views</h3>


<p>The scenery as you traverse this coast is jaw dropping. Fortunately, the Aussies have carved turnouts frequently along the route, so you can allow others to pass or just get out to admire the view.</p>

<p>Oh, God, what a view! The every twist and turn reveals towering cliffs beaten by ocean surf, white sand beaches that stretch for kilometers, sandstone rock formations standing by themselves in the ocean, having been carved from the mainland by the sea’s relentless wave action for eons.   If you are a photographer, you’ll need to plan your agenda carefully, or else you’ll never make it past the first 20 kilometers.</p>

<p>Along the road are photographic side trips, images of fields, sheep grazing, even rain forests with huge, tree-like primitive ferns that give you the eerie feeling of walking the earth of 300,000,000 years ago. There are also several waterfalls that offer great photo opps.</p>

<p><a href="http://blog.lesterpickerphoto.com/wp-content/uploads/2010/11/Great-Ocean-Road-Victoria-Australia-1562010-11-10.jpg"><img class="size-medium wp-image-693" title="Great Ocean Road, Victoria, Australia 1562010-11-10" src="http://blog.lesterpickerphoto.com/wp-content/uploads/2010/11/Great-Ocean-Road-Victoria-Australia-1562010-11-10-199x300.jpg" alt="" width="199" height="300"></a></p>

<h3>Critiques &amp; Comments Welcome</h3>


<p>On my agenda were certain iconic shots- the 12 Apostles, various arches and the like- but also some less frequented sites where I could play with light and water motion. I’ve included a few of those shots here, but I haven’t been able to do any post-processing since I’m on the road. But, I think you’ll get the idea. In any event, I welcome your comments and critique.</p>

		  <div class="entry-content"><h3>Viti Levu</h3>


<p>Fiji is actually a tropical island archipelago consisting of more than 300 islands and 500 tiny islets. Only 110 islands are populated (by humans), but 87% of the population lives on the islands of Viti Levu and Vanua Levu, the largest in the chain.</p>

<p>And so, bound by our ship’s schedule, we stopped at the capital of Suva on the eastern side of Viti Levu for a day, followed by a one-day stop in Lautoka, on the west side of the island.</p>

<p>In one of my past blogs I talked about the limitations of cruise ship travel for serious photographers. But, since I teach photography onboard cruise ships, I have no choice of venues or layover times.</p>

<h3>Colo-I-Suva Forest</h3>


<p>To be perfectly blunt, I could do without seeing Suva again. It is an economically depressed city. However, there are some interesting natural areas on the outskirts of the city. One we visited was the Colo-I-Suva Forest Park, about 25 minutes out of town. Although not well maintained, it does offer some good hiking and photo ops. Just be sure you have a guide with you, as the area has had some robberies at the hands of locals in recent years. It is patrolled erratically by police, but I wouldn’t count on their sporadic presence. Our taxi driver, Edward, escorted us wherever we went. The trails can be very slippery and the trail railings are flimsy, so come prepared. Be sure to bring rain gear with you, too. Downpours can be sudden and severe.</p>

<h3>Photographing in Local Markets</h3>


<p>The saving graces- at least as far as photography goes- in Suva and Lautoka, are their  local produce markets. Wandering through these vibrant markets one is immediately caught up in the fragrant aromas of exotic spices and plants. Most of the vendors are hard-working Indians who have extensively migrated to Fiji and control most of the commercial scene. Unfortunately, that has produced some resentment on the part of native Fijians, which can erupt into ugly shouting matches among taxi drivers vying for business, for example.</p>

<p><a href="http://blog.lesterpickerphoto.com/wp-content/uploads/2010/11/New-Caledonia-Fiji-62010-11-02.jpg"><img class="size-medium wp-image-685" title="New Caledonia-Fiji 62010-11-02" src="http://blog.lesterpickerphoto.com/wp-content/uploads/2010/11/New-Caledonia-Fiji-62010-11-02-300x199.jpg" alt="" width="300" height="199"></a></p>

<p>That aside, the markets are a cacophony of sights and sounds. The vendors are as colorful as their wares and most are welcoming of the respectful photographer (see my blog on photographing people: <a href="http://blog.lesterpickerphoto.com/2010/02/13/photographing-people/">http://blog.lesterpickerphoto.com/2010/02/13/photographing-people/</a> ). We had a marvelous time wandering through the market, asking people about the strange produce and spices, a great way to strike up conversations and learn more about the people and local culture.</p>

<p><a href="http://blog.lesterpickerphoto.com/wp-content/uploads/2010/11/New-Caledonia-Fiji-72010-11-02.jpg"><img class="size-medium wp-image-686" title="New Caledonia-Fiji 72010-11-02" src="http://blog.lesterpickerphoto.com/wp-content/uploads/2010/11/New-Caledonia-Fiji-72010-11-02-200x300.jpg" alt="" width="200" height="300"></a></p>

<p>The weather was mercifully better in Lautoka, not unexpected since the western side of the island is less prone to wet weather. But, again, we were not able to take advantage of the natural landscape, due to the time constraints of the ship’s visit. Still, Viti Levu provided me with great opportunities to meet and photograph interesting people.</p>

<p><a href="http://blog.lesterpickerphoto.com/wp-content/uploads/2010/11/New-Caledonia-Fiji-92010-11-02.jpg"><img class="size-medium wp-image-687 " title="New Caledonia-Fiji 92010-11-02" src="http://blog.lesterpickerphoto.com/wp-content/uploads/2010/11/New-Caledonia-Fiji-92010-11-02-200x300.jpg" alt="" width="200" height="300"></a></p>

<p>Outside the port cities, Fiji is blessed with such an abundance of beaches and dive sites, you’d need a guidebook devoted just to that (there are such books, BTW). So, if you are a beach person, this is paradise. All of the high-end resorts boast a private beach with every water activity you could imagine, and some which you may not have known existed.</p>

<p>I’m looking forward to returning on our own, so we can become familiar with the surrounding photo ops and take advantage of them on <em>our</em> schedule.</p>

		  <div class="entry-content"><p>Sydney is a walker’s city, so I’m hard pressed make a recommendation for where to stay. Anyplace you choose, within your budget, of course, would be fine as far as location goes. I highly recommend the Four Points Sheraton, located smack-dab on the shore of Darling Harbour, and linked to it by walkway. The Ibis Hotel is another great facility, located a few blocks further within the city, next to the theater district.</p>

<p><a href="http://blog.lesterpickerphoto.com/wp-content/uploads/2010/11/Sydney-3092010-10-26.jpg"><img class="size-medium wp-image-674" title="Sydney 3092010-10-26" src="http://blog.lesterpickerphoto.com/wp-content/uploads/2010/11/Sydney-3092010-10-26-300x199.jpg" alt="" width="300" height="199"></a></p>

<p>The centerpiece on this end of the city⎯ and there are centerpieces throughout Sydney⎯ is Darling Harbour. It’s hard to describe this venue, except to say that it is the epitome of mixed-use waterfront development. Darling Harbour is a beehive of activity. Here you’ll see people walking, biking, eating, smooching, and just plain touring. A monorail system seamlessly winds its way through the waterfront. In short, it is a photographer’s paradise.</p>

<p><a href="http://blog.lesterpickerphoto.com/wp-content/uploads/2010/11/Sydney-3172010-10-26.jpg"><img class="size-medium wp-image-676" title="Sydney 3172010-10-26" src="http://blog.lesterpickerphoto.com/wp-content/uploads/2010/11/Sydney-3172010-10-26-199x300.jpg" alt="" width="199" height="300"></a></p>

<p>One can choose to walk around Darling Harbour or cross an always-busy pedestrian bridge that links both sides in the middle of the harbor. There is an Imax theater, convention center, every ethnic food imaginable, even a bagel shop that… well, it’s not a New York bagel, but it’s good.</p>

<p>The harbor itself is humming with boat traffic, mostly tourist venues taking people out for a cruise around the famed Sydney Opera House. But there are also jet boat tours, kayakers galore, even fishermen fishing at harbor’s edge. Replicas of the original lighthouse and of Captain Cook’s ship, The Endeavor, draw in tourist crowds.</p>

<p><a href="http://blog.lesterpickerphoto.com/wp-content/uploads/2010/11/Sydney-3192010-10-26.jpg"><img class="size-medium wp-image-675" title="Sydney 3192010-10-26" src="http://blog.lesterpickerphoto.com/wp-content/uploads/2010/11/Sydney-3192010-10-26-300x199.jpg" alt="" width="300" height="199"></a></p>

<p>One interesting eatery is Grill’d Burger, where one can grab burgers of every description, including three different kinds of veggie burgers, plus a selection of Aussie beers. It is relatively inexpensive as far as Sydney prices go.</p>

<p>Sydney also boasts an active Asian community, and Chinatown here is well known for its shops and high quality restaurants. Just a few blocks from Darling Harbor, on Sussex Street, you’ll find one of the best restaurants on the outskirts of Chinatown, a fusion Thai property known as Home Thai. Let’s just say that I challenge you to find better tasting Asian food anywhere! A telling sign was that, with the exception of two other men, my wife and I were the only Caucasians present. Pad Thai may sound boring to you by now, but try it here and you won’t regret it. I saved half of my generous portion to eat for breakfast the next day.</p>

<p><a href="http://blog.lesterpickerphoto.com/wp-content/uploads/2010/11/Sydney-4002010-10-27.jpg"><img class="size-medium wp-image-677" title="Sydney 4002010-10-27" src="http://blog.lesterpickerphoto.com/wp-content/uploads/2010/11/Sydney-4002010-10-27-199x300.jpg" alt="" width="199" height="300"></a></p>

<p>And, speaking of breakfast, if you’re near Darling Harbour at that hour, you simply must try Waldemere’s, a small boutique establishment run by Menno Tabbernal, a Dutch immigrant with a degree in hospitality management. It shows in his exceptional attention to customer service and the meticulous way Waldemere’s food is served. From basic yogurt with granola and fruit to eggs and brown bread, every dish is superb. The restaurant also offers free Wifi, not universally available in Sydney, so the pricey nature of Waldemere’s is more than made up for by its relaxed atmosphere and warm hospitality.   Next up… New Caledonia!</p>

		  <div class="entry-content"><p>Sydney is an amazing city, as much for its vitality and friendly residents as it is for the scads of things to see, do and taste. In my last blog I described the character of the city. Today I’ll suggest some places to visit.</p>

<p>Sydney is a city of iconic locations, the most famous of which is undoubtedly the Sydney Opera House, an immense complex of theaters and exhibition halls nestled under what is arguably the most famous roof- actually series of roofs- in the world. No matter from what part of the harbor you view them, the gleaming white shells are impressive, indeed.</p>

<p>The Opera House is fun to walk through and around, each walkway offering a different and intimate view of the famed architecture. But the secret to a fun day in Sydney is in <em>getting</em> to the Opera House. Most tourists take a taxi or bus there. Let me suggest a better way.</p>

<p><a href="http://blog.lesterpickerphoto.com/wp-content/uploads/2010/10/Sydney-2302010-10-26.jpg"><img class="size-medium wp-image-666" title="Sydney 2302010-10-26" src="http://blog.lesterpickerphoto.com/wp-content/uploads/2010/10/Sydney-2302010-10-26-199x300.jpg" alt="" width="199" height="300"></a></p>

<p>Start out in the morning at the north end of Hyde Park, where you’ll take in the view of the immense St. Mary’s Cathedral. Sit at the impressive Archibald Memorial Fountain in the midst of the park and you will hear high-caliber street musicians serenading passersby. On our visit a young flamenco guitarist mesmerized tourists and residents with his fingering dexterity and wide range of musical selections. Enjoy the well-groomed gardens and take in the pleasing architecture of the cathedral itself. When you’re ready, start your walk down Art Gallery Road, which takes off from the northeast end of the park. In a few hundred yards you enter The Domain, a huge public park enjoyed by Sydneyites year round.</p>

<p><a href="http://blog.lesterpickerphoto.com/wp-content/uploads/2010/10/Sydney-2352010-10-26.jpg"><img class="aligncenter size-medium wp-image-667" title="Sydney 2352010-10-26" src="http://blog.lesterpickerphoto.com/wp-content/uploads/2010/10/Sydney-2352010-10-26-199x300.jpg" alt="Art Museum" width="199" height="300"></a></p>

<p>Within another few hundred yards you come to the Art Gallery of New South Wales, a fresh, airy and delightful museum. Aboriginal art and culture dominates (no photography allowed), but there are also galleries devoted to European artists where you can also photograph to your heart’s content. Sprinkled throughout the museum are places to sit and contemplate. The café is simply wonderful. Our meals were freshly prepared, nicely seasoned and, uncommon for Sydney, reasonably priced.</p>

<p>Once out of the museum, continue walking along the same road, which now turns into Mrs. Macquaries Road. At the point there is a stone bench dedicated to a former governor’s wife. From the point you’ll enjoy commanding views of part of Sydney harbor, especially across the cove to the Opera House.</p>

<p><a href="http://blog.lesterpickerphoto.com/wp-content/uploads/2010/10/Sydney-1542010-10-26.jpg"><img class="size-medium wp-image-668" title="Sydney 1542010-10-26" src="http://blog.lesterpickerphoto.com/wp-content/uploads/2010/10/Sydney-1542010-10-26-200x300.jpg" alt="" width="200" height="300"></a></p>

<p>As you continue around the cove, stroll into the Royal Botanical Gardens and admire the vast collection of plants and trees, including a huge diversity of palms. As you go deeper into the gardens, keep glancing up. Eventually you will spot some fruit bats, then more, and more and more. The Gardens are home to thousands of these immense, harmless creatures, who graze on the abundant figs and other fruits in and around the park. It’s fascinating to watch them grooming as they hang upside-down. They are a loud bunch, too, yelping and calling to each other and creating a cacophony of sound that surrounds you. If you time the visit right, at dusk, you’ll see them flying off on their appointed rounds.</p>

<p>Now simply continue your walk along the cove and you’ll be in the vicinity of the Opera House. But hold off for a little while, if you can.</p>

<p><a href="http://blog.lesterpickerphoto.com/wp-content/uploads/2010/10/Sydney-932010-10-25.jpg"><img class="size-medium wp-image-669" title="Sydney 932010-10-25" src="http://blog.lesterpickerphoto.com/wp-content/uploads/2010/10/Sydney-932010-10-25-199x300.jpg" alt="" width="199" height="300"></a></p>

<p>Right near the Opera House is a captivating area of historic streets and structures. The tiny, but interesting Discovery Museum sits tucked away on a narrow alleyway called Kendall Lane. Across from this must-see museum, is a shopping mall. Once out of the mall, deservedly well-known restaurants, patisseries and pubs surround you. Pick any one and you can’t go wrong. Better yet, take something to go.</p>

<p>Now you’re ready for the Opera House. Walk the few remaining blocks and…</p>

<p>No, wait a minute! First take a detour. It’s still only late afternoon, the perfect time to take a side trip up Argyle Street to The Sydney Observatory. The Opera House will wait (the best time to see it is toward dusk anyway).</p>

<p><a href="http://blog.lesterpickerphoto.com/wp-content/uploads/2010/10/Sydney-1532010-10-25.jpg"><img class="size-medium wp-image-670" title="Sydney 1532010-10-25" src="http://blog.lesterpickerphoto.com/wp-content/uploads/2010/10/Sydney-1532010-10-25-300x199.jpg" alt="" width="300" height="199"></a></p>

<p>The Observatory sits atop a hill, with a panoramic view of Sydney. It is a historic structure housing an astronomical observatory, now defunct, but turned into a terrific little museum. Here you can see photo exhibits of the planets, stars and galaxies, as well as historically interesting exhibits on Australian astronomy.</p>

<p>The grounds offer up a lovely garden, places to sit peacefully and take in the Sydney skyline. Enjoy your take-out while sitting on a bench under mammoth ficus trees. Okay, when you’re done, you’re <em>now</em> ready for the Opera House. Trek back down Argyle Street, stroll around Circular Quay and you’ll see streets leading to the Opera House on your left.  Enjoy!</p>

<p>In my next blog we’ll explore another popular Sydney area.</p>

		  <div class="entry-content"><p>The past three days have been wonderful, as we toured Sydney about as hard as any travel photojournalist could. My tendency is to try out-of-the-way venues to add value to my readers’ experience, and this visit was no exception.   First, some impressions. Sydney is as high energy as Manhattan, and I don’t say that idly, since I am a native New Yawkah. Sydney is every bit as frenetic and cosmopolitan, but in a wholly different way. We’re here in late October (spring) and it is sunny and bright, with the expected periodic rain showers.</p>

<p>The city revolves around the water. Sydney is blessed with numerous harbors and the Aussies have developed them to a fine art. Take Baltimore’s Inner Harbor, New York’s South Street Seaport, San Francisco’s Fisherman’s Wharf and crank  them up a notch or two and you have an idea of what a happening place an attraction like Darling Harbour, for example, is. People are busily shopping, leisurely strolling, savoring the diverse eateries, or else kayaking and biking along this massive urban playground.</p>

<p><a href="http://blog.lesterpickerphoto.com/wp-content/uploads/2010/10/Sydney-42010-10-26.jpg"><img class="size-medium wp-image-659" title="Sydney 42010-10-26" src="http://blog.lesterpickerphoto.com/wp-content/uploads/2010/10/Sydney-42010-10-26-300x199.jpg" alt="" width="300" height="199"></a></p>

<p>Oh, did I mention biking? Sydney is a biker’s dream. Bicyclists are everywhere, probably due, at least in part, to the ridiculously high parking fees in the city. We parked overnight, from 10:00 PM to 10:00 AM and it cost $72.00. While we walked around town, construction was going on in several places to increase the number of bike paths and also make the city more walker friendly, something that 97% of Sydneyites requested in a recent survey.</p>

<p>And that is needed, because right now the city suffers from too many cars and excessive car noise. At some point every day my eyes burned from the car exhaust. But Sydneyites have learned to coexist with cars. They are an extraordinarily patient lot, as they wait for the walk signals to turn green, sometimes a very long wait due to the heavy traffic. The one time I impatiently crossed before the green pedestrian go-ahead light, I was pegged as a foreigner and stared down by a crowd of residents.</p>

<p>One thing you will find out as soon as you have your first meal in Sydney is that it is one expensive city. A small bottled water is $3.00, a cup of hot tea is $3.50, and meals… forget trying to get a decent meal for less than $30, not including spirits.</p>

<p><a href="http://blog.lesterpickerphoto.com/wp-content/uploads/2010/10/Sydney-32010-10-26.jpg"><img class="size-medium wp-image-660" title="Sydney 32010-10-26" src="http://blog.lesterpickerphoto.com/wp-content/uploads/2010/10/Sydney-32010-10-26-300x199.jpg" alt="" width="300" height="199"></a></p>

<p>To encourage walking, there are skywalks galore, pedestrian tunnels and bridges. A monorail takes residents and tourists alike all along the downtown. Modern buses provide easy public transportation options. Sydneyites do walk a lot, but they also exercise in other ways. During lunch hours we noticed individuals and organized groups meeting to run together, do aerobics and yoga.</p>

<p><a href="http://blog.lesterpickerphoto.com/wp-content/uploads/2010/10/Sydney-52010-10-26.jpg"><img class="size-medium wp-image-661" title="Sydney 52010-10-26" src="http://blog.lesterpickerphoto.com/wp-content/uploads/2010/10/Sydney-52010-10-26-300x199.jpg" alt="" width="300" height="199"></a></p>

<p>The architecture parallels that of the major North American cities; tall skyscrapers, and showcase buildings by well-known architects. Buildings are full of light and texture, very inviting and pleasing to the eye. For those of us in the U.S., Sydney does present us with a mystery. Where are the homeless people? In three days, I could not find one homeless person on the streets or in the city’s many parks.</p>

<p><a href="http://blog.lesterpickerphoto.com/wp-content/uploads/2010/10/Sydney-22010-10-26.jpg"><img class="size-medium wp-image-662" title="Sydney 22010-10-26" src="http://blog.lesterpickerphoto.com/wp-content/uploads/2010/10/Sydney-22010-10-26-199x300.jpg" alt="" width="199" height="300"></a></p>

<p>Today we spent four hours in the Royal Botanic Gardens. Four hours? Well, for starters the gardens and the public park adjoining it are the size of the entire Sydney city center. The park and gardens wrap around a cove and offer a peaceful oasis from the hustle and bustle of the city. The park is immaculately clean, as is the entire city, by the way. The gardens are interesting not only for those fascinated with flowers and trees, but for one of their most amazing residents. But I’m not revealing what that resident is until my next blog, where I’ll share specifics on restaurants, lodging and tourist attractions that you might want to consider if⎯ no, make that when⎯ you get to Sydney.</p>

		  <div class="entry-content"><p>Well, we finally made it Down Under, but let’s just say it wasn’t exactly uneventful. We were up at 6:00 AM, needing to do umpteen things prior to our afternoon flight. Flying  from BWI to Toronto on Air Canada on a Havilland Dash propeller plane was uneventful, as was our brief layover.</p>

<p>Our cross-country flight to Vancouver was quite pleasant, mostly due to a terrific flight crew who were collectively attentive and engaging. Then we descended into Vancouver International, precisely at the same moment that a large bird decided to greet us, a bit too enthusiastically. Pop! and there went one of our engines. We landed safely, but after waiting until 3:00 AM (east coast time), we were informed that the engine was too badly damaged to continue on.</p>

<p>Air Canada was wonderful in terms of keeping us constantly informed. Once the decision was made to cancel, they pulled in resources to get us processed. Unfortunately, we had to go up and down escalators and walk across the airport to reclaim our luggage, go back to ticketing, get re-ticketed for a morning flight, receive our hotel, taxi and meal vouchers and try to grab a few hours sleep.</p>

<p><a href="http://blog.lesterpickerphoto.com/wp-content/uploads/2010/10/vancouver-aiport-142010-10-22.jpg"><img class="size-medium wp-image-655" title="vancouver aiport 142010-10-22" src="http://blog.lesterpickerphoto.com/wp-content/uploads/2010/10/vancouver-aiport-142010-10-22-300x199.jpg" alt="" width="300" height="199"></a></p>

<p>We were back in the airport at 8:30 AM. Fortunately for me, my wife is absolutely the best travel companion, so we tend to look at these travel hiccups as part of the adventure. And, sure enough, our gate agent that morning was Francis, a supervisor who has helped me before in transit through Vancouver. We greeted each other with smiles and a handshake, he gave us another meal voucher and we traded email contact info. I’ll probably see him again when I head up to the Yukon this February (brrrr!!) to shoot the Quest dogsled race. And that’s the thing I’d like to focus on in this blog; how having a mindset that looks at every travel challenge as an opportunity is really the only way to go.</p>

<p>All around us during this delay we saw several truly unhappy people. Not that I fault them. Delays, when you’re already tired and stressed from air travel, is no fun. But, what is, is. You can’t change these things, so just go with the flow. Look around; make a friend; reach out; trade business cards, talk about your respective kids, whatever. Being miserable is a choice.</p>

<p>Now here’s the next opportunity for us. Vancouver happens to be one of my favorite airports. It’s light and airy. It has free Wifi. There are so many eateries I always have a hard time choosing and they’re spread out so that you don’t feel as if you are at a mall. You can choose to eat around crowds, or find a nice private spot, you can do fast food or sit down at a restaurant.</p>

<p><a href="http://blog.lesterpickerphoto.com/wp-content/uploads/2010/10/vancouver-aiport-122010-10-22.jpg"><img class="size-medium wp-image-656" title="vancouver aiport 122010-10-22" src="http://blog.lesterpickerphoto.com/wp-content/uploads/2010/10/vancouver-aiport-122010-10-22-199x300.jpg" alt="" width="199" height="300"></a></p>

<p>Best of all, Vancouver airport has lots of wonderful educational opportunities. Sprinkled throughout are exhibits of the region’s natural history. There are sculptures and exhibits about indigenous peoples. So there we were, tired and hungry, walking to our gate, when we came upon a huge, two-story vertical aquarium that I hadn’t seen before. Surprise! We stopped and watched the exhibit of local fish, anemones, starfish, kelp and sea urchins. What a rejuvenating experience, one we would not have had if our plane had not been delayed. We had a snack, watching people watching the aquarium display.</p>

<p>In my next blog I’ll share some first impressions about Australia.</p>

		  <div class="entry-content"><p>We’re ready to leave and I’ve already given instructions to our house sitter… multiple times (I’m beginning to envy his carefree life over the course of our trip).</p>

<p>It’s T-minus-2 days. The Australia and Fiji segments are wrapped up, leaving just a few loose ends on our New Zealand adventure. I’m determined to allow that part of the trip to stay loose, in order to take advantage of the photo ops that present themselves.</p>

<p>Right now I’m doing my photo organizing and cleaning. I like to start a trip with clean equipment, so I can amass a rich and diverse collection of dust spots on my sensor as I travel. I mean, what else would I do with my time at night in my hotel room when I’m dead tired other than clean my equipment in dim lighting?</p>

<p>Since this trip is so long and will involve hiking to some remote locations, I have to limit my equipment. You can see from the photo some of what I’ve decided to take along. Most of that equipment will have to fit tightly into my ThinkTank photo backpack (see my previous blog on the backpack I’ll be taking: <a href="http://blog.lesterpickerphoto.com/2009/05/25/transporting-your-gear/">http://blog.lesterpickerphoto.com/2009/05/25/transporting-your-gear/</a>).</p>

		  <div class="entry-content"><p>To my blog readers:</p>

<p>I&#8217;m excited to announce that I was just chosen to be the new photography columnist for ScotteVest.</p>

<p><a href="http://blog.lesterpickerphoto.com/wp-content/uploads/2010/10/pro_photographers_01_page1.jpg"><img class="aligncenter size-medium wp-image-642" title="pro_photographers_01_page" src="http://blog.lesterpickerphoto.com/wp-content/uploads/2010/10/pro_photographers_01_page1-300x111.jpg" alt="" width="300" height="111"></a></p>

<p>If you haven&#8217;t seen their Internet presence yet, you probably are not an outdoorsy-type, since they advertise heavily online. ScotteVest manufactures some of the finest travel and outdoor clothing I have ever had the joy of owning. Their claim to fame is the number of pockets built into their clothing and their durable construction. In fact, it was my use of their product that drew us together (<a href="http://blog.lesterpickerphoto.com/2010/09/19/invest-in-evest-scottevest-that-is/">http://blog.lesterpickerphoto.com/2010/09/19/invest-in-evest-scottevest-that-is/</a>).</p>

<p>I have used ScotteVest products for quite a while now and have been impressed with their design and construction. For the photographer, their clothing has just about everything we could want, especially POCKETS&#8230; tons and tons of pockets in which to place all the accessories we carry around.</p>

<p>In any event, I&#8217;m proud to be associated with this fine product and its founder, Scott Jordan. Visit my column on their site and then be sure to browse their product line (<a href="http://www.scottevest.com/company/photography.shtml">http://www.scottevest.com/company/photography.shtml</a>).</p>

<p>I would also love to hear from you about your candid experiences with ScotteVest products as a traveler and as a photographer.</p>

<p>Happy travels! Happy shooting!</p>

		  <div class="entry-content"><p>Okay, so the Australia-Fiji-New Zealand trip and assignment is exactly 15 days off and I’m feeling rattled. A few items in the itinerary have been nailed down since my last blog post, but there’s a heckuva lot more to go.</p>

<p>So far I have the flights to and from Australia and New Zealand finalized, as well as one flight within Australia. Getting to Fiji has been set for months. I’ve got two car rentals arranged and a couple of nice lodging properties lined up and almost finalized, a good thing since I’m doing several travel articles/photojournalism pieces. But I figure I still have at least 60% of the arrangements left to make, particularly for properties around New Zealand’s southwest coast (Fiordland National Park region). I have numerous leads out there, but they haven’t been finalized.</p>

<p>For those of you who think you’d relish the life of a travel photojournalist, this is the part I dread. Sure, the travel itself is nice; the eye candy of amazing new landscapes, meeting fascinating people, sampling new foods. But getting there entails myriad details that take entirely too much time and energy to set up. At times like this I wish I had an assistant to nail these details, but I often end up deciding on last-minute, must-photograph locations, adding or subtracting hotels… you get the picture. The end result is a frustrated assistant. Better to do it myself (although I’m always on the lookout for that ‘perfect’ assistant who can take charge and run with it).</p>

<p>I’m also thinking about photo equipment I need to take; cameras, lenses, accessories. This is not an idle exercise, since Australian airlines charge $10 for every kilo (2.2 pounds) above 20 kilos of checked baggage within country and a whopping $20 per kilo for flights to New Zealand! That would easily add hundreds of dollars to my fares.</p>

<p>I’ve also got to consider how I’ll transport my gear, both while traveling and hiking to remote locations. I prefer to use my <em>ThinkTank</em> wheeling camera bag for air/train/ship travel, but I probably won’t be able to take that <strong><em>and</em></strong> my <em>ThinkTank</em> Rotation 360 backpack. I’ll keep you posted on my final decisions in an upcoming blog.</p>

<p>A couple of weeks ago I started training at my gym for my excursion. Most people don’t think of this when they think ‘photojournalist,’ but the work can be physically demanding. I carry 30-40 pounds of equipment with me to remote locations, so I have to stay in shape. Typically, beginning a month prior to a major trip I’ll go to my gym three or four times a week dressed in my hiking clothes, and walk the treadmill for an hour or two, varying the up and down hill inclines throughout. I carry my full photo backpack. I’m sure I look like a total dork but, hey, someone’s got to play the role. (In the accompanying photo I&#8217;m using the ThinkTank Rotation 360)</p>

<p><a href="http://blog.lesterpickerphoto.com/wp-content/uploads/2010/10/lesontreadmill-1-of-1.jpg"><img class="size-medium wp-image-616" title="lesontreadmill 1 of 1" src="http://blog.lesterpickerphoto.com/wp-content/uploads/2010/10/lesontreadmill-1-of-1-225x300.jpg" alt="" width="225" height="300"></a></p>

<p>P.S.: As of yesterday an arrangement in New Zealand I was counting on fell through, so I’ve got to start that segment again from scratch!</p>

		  <div class="entry-content"><p>Ever watch a pro or advanced amateur photographer at work? Chances are you’ve noticed that almost all of them share a twitch of sorts. It goes something like this: camera hangs on a strap on their left shoulder… up goes their right hand… grab strap at shoulder… pull up as left shoulder simultaneously rises and left arm juts out a bit to help out… put right hand back down… repeat every 60 seconds.</p>

<p>What I’m referring to here is camera strap slippage (not related to George Castanza’s shrinkage problem, mind you). Camera strap slippage is an especially frustrating affliction for someone like me with sloping shoulders. For decades I have struggled with constantly having to hoist my camera strap back up on my shoulder. In fact, take a look at this collection of straps and this is after I have sold or given away at least a dozen others over the years.</p>

<p><a href="http://blog.lesterpickerphoto.com/wp-content/uploads/2010/09/straps-1-of-1.jpg"><img class="aligncenter size-medium wp-image-609" title="straps 1 of 1" src="http://blog.lesterpickerphoto.com/wp-content/uploads/2010/09/straps-1-of-1-199x300.jpg" alt="" width="199" height="300"></a></p>

<p>Well, folks, not anymore. About five years ago I discovered UPStrap, manufactured by an interested guy in Florida, Al Stegmeyer (<a href="http://www.upstrap-pro.com">www.upstrap-pro.com</a>). I know it sounds completely stupid, but this strap has changed my photography. A couple of months after buying it my wife noticed that I wasn’t twitching constantly while hiking with my cameras. This is the honest truth; the neck pain that I used to have from keeping my shoulder propped up all day while photographing is gone!</p>

<p><a href="http://blog.lesterpickerphoto.com/wp-content/uploads/2010/09/slr_kevlar_black_sm.jpg"><img class="aligncenter size-medium wp-image-610" title="slr_kevlar_black_sm" src="http://blog.lesterpickerphoto.com/wp-content/uploads/2010/09/slr_kevlar_black_sm-254x300.jpg" alt="" width="254" height="300"></a></p>

<p>I own three UPStraps now. They’re made of an incredible new-fangled rubber compound with little nubs on it that stick to your shoulder like glue and feel like nothing&#8217;s there. I put a camera on my shoulder and forget it. That thing won’t come off even if you accidentally knock into someone. They are a bit pricey, but I haven’t had to replace one yet, and I’m in some pretty difficult locations for equipment, from the Sahara to the Arctic.</p>

<p>What made me think of the UPStrap is a recent email I got from Al, advising me that there was a potential problem with the stitching where the strap attaches to the camera. I was asked to go to their site if I wanted replacements, which I immediately did. In a few days I received a package with replacements and a request from Al to please return the old ones for analysis and credit from his factory.</p>

<p>There are so few people who are committed to excellence in product construction and customer service nowadays. Obviously Al comes to mind, as does Bob Singh of Singh-Ray filters (more on him in a future blog). Once I called Al to discuss a technical issue I faced while photographing on a tripod in moderate wind. I wondered, with all the straps and buckles and snaps he used in his product line, if there might be something he could do to fix the problem. He’d think about it. In three days I received a package in the mail from Al with a solution.</p>

<p>So, do yourself a favor. If you suffer from camera strap slippage, visit the UPStrap website and treat yourself to a great product.</p>

		  <div class="entry-content"><p>One of the hassles of travel for me is toting around an entire file folder of flight, hotel and rental car confirmations. Why do the confirmations have to be 5 pages long? Even if I print only the first page, on a 3-4 week assignment that frequently entails 30-40 pages of confirmations.</p>

<p>Enter the niftiest iPod Touch (also iPhone and iPad) app I have ever seen. It’s called TripIt and I’ve fallen in love with it. Here’s what it does and how it works.</p>

<p><a href="http://blog.lesterpickerphoto.com/wp-content/uploads/2010/09/images1.jpeg"><img class="aligncenter size-medium wp-image-602" title="images" src="http://blog.lesterpickerphoto.com/wp-content/uploads/2010/09/images1-300x160.jpg" alt="" width="300" height="160"></a></p>

<p>Basically, TripIt creates a complete itinerary of your trip and makes it available on your iPod, iPhone or iPad (it may also do Windows-based systems, but I’m not sure). I do mean complete, from flight info to hotels, rental cars, events, whatever. Since I use Apple’s Mobile Me, it automatically and wirelessly syncs my iPod Touch, laptop and desktop as soon as I make a change on any device. Mobile Me also stores the information in the “cloud” so I can retrieve it in the unlikely event of a systems crash or a stolen or broken device.</p>

<p>What is most amazing of all is that once you register, all you need to do is forward your confirmation emails to TripIt and it automagically adds them to your itinerary! You just forward it to <a href="mailto:plan@tripit.com">plan@tripit.com</a>. That’s it. No subject heading to add, not even one word of explanation. It detects from your email address that the confirmation is for your itinerary and that’s it. In seconds it pops up on your TripIt itinerary. This thing is so complete, it even includes your departure gate, synced to your mobile device as soon as the airline releases it.</p>

<p>The itinerary includes your confirmation number, reservation number, addresses of hotels. Amazingly, TripIt simultaneously downloads a Google map of the area, with a pin showing the location of your hotel or car rental agency! Plus, it adds a constantly updated weather report for each stop in your itinerary.</p>

<p><a href="http://blog.lesterpickerphoto.com/wp-content/uploads/2010/09/images-1.jpeg"><img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-603" title="images-1" src="http://blog.lesterpickerphoto.com/wp-content/uploads/2010/09/images-1.jpeg" alt="" width="183" height="275"></a></p>

<p>If you are staying in a tiny lodge in the bush somewhere, and TripIt can’t decipher their confirmation email (or if the lodge doesn’t send one), you can add to your itinerary manually. I’m loving this thing. No more carrying around reams of paper. Everything in one place, available in a tap and swipe.</p>

<p>You can have multiple trips going at once. TripIt even keeps track of every one of your airline miles accounts.</p>

<p>Okay now, I saved the best for last. The cost of this app is a big, fat 0. Zilch, nadda, zip (there is a premium version called TripIt Pro that goes for $49 a year and includes lots of power features, but I don’t use it… yet). Go to TripIt.com for more info and an entertaining video.</p>

<p><strong><em>Addendum (June, 2011)</em></strong>: I decided to purchase the Pro version and I love it. The more traveling you do, the more value you&#8217;ll get from the Pro version of this app.</p>

		  <div class="entry-content"><p>Every so often a product appears in the marketplace that makes you think: Why didn’t someone think of that sooner?</p>

<p>That’s how I felt the first time I used a ScotteVest product, the brainchild of founder Scott Jordan. Scottevest (www.scottevest.com) is a line of clothing designed for people who embrace an active lifestyle. The pants, shirts, vests and jackets are ruggedly constructed of lightweight materials, but any similarity to standard outdoors wear ends there. In my quest to share great products with my readers— products that I actually use— I’d like to give you this heads-up.</p>

<p>The secret to the ScotteVest line is in the astounding number of pockets hidden throughout the garments. My jacket (the Quantum; now discontinued), has something like 25 pockets, no exaggeration! My TEC shirt has 8 pockets. But think again if you believe their clothing looks like a dorky photo vest. ScotteVest designers have put together well-styled and durable garments with thoughtfully placed pockets.</p>

<p><a href="http://blog.lesterpickerphoto.com/wp-content/uploads/2010/09/pocketmap_packw_reg.jpg"><img class="size-medium wp-image-593" title="pocketmap_packw_reg" src="http://blog.lesterpickerphoto.com/wp-content/uploads/2010/09/pocketmap_packw_reg-300x161.jpg" alt="" width="300" height="161"></a></p>

<p>Take my jacket, for example. In the late fall, winter and early spring I use it almost exclusively for my photo forays. It is water resistant, has a removable hood, adjustable sleeves, draw cords, armpit vents and a breathable mesh lining. But here’s the winning formula for photographers; it is lined with pockets for every gadget you could possibly carry. I have separate pockets for my right angle viewers (2), my Lee filter holder, filters, shutter release cords, memory cards, 2-3 lenses, a point-and-shoot, etc. The jacket, like many of their jackets in their current product line, has 2 chest pockets specifically designed to fit an iPod, iPhone or smartphone. The high-tech materials lining those pockets are completely see-through, so I’m able to make calls, run my photo apps, or follow a map without taking them out of the pockets.</p>

<p>There are other perks for photographers. My jacket has a shock cord and clip in one of the pockets with a microfiber cloth attached! There is a pocket for business cards, pens, pencils and Lenspens. One pocket has an extendable key holder. When I leave the house I clip my keys to it and don&#8217;t have to worry about losing them in a bog. Another feature is an internal wiring system through which you string your earphones, connect it to your phone or iPod and make calls or listen to music.</p>

<p>Interestingly, the entire jacket is so well balanced (they call it their Weight Management System) I’m hardly aware of all the photo junk I’m packing. I just load up, sling my Gitzo with attached camera over my shoulder and I’m off.</p>

<p>I’d be remiss if I didn’t mention a shortcoming, although it’s kind of a moot point, given that my jacket is now discontinued. To be a perfect photo jacket I would have preferred one large flap-type pocket on each side of the jacket to hold a camera body or medium lens. I’m hoping that ScotteVest’s designers will make a dedicated photo vest in the future; I’m sure it would be a winner.</p>

		  <div class="entry-content"><p>For me, one of the joys of writing a blog, or teaching a workshop, is the opportunity to pass on knowledge that I’ve gained from 40 years in the field, as well as learn from others and make new friends.</p>

<p>There are some aspects of photography that I do not consider my area of expertise. I think of people like Bob Boyer (http://photo.rwboyer.com/), who is a true expert in photographic lighting, post-processing and the technical aspects of photography (aside from being an Aperture guru). His expertise on Aperture (and Photoshop) draws thousands of fans every month to his blog site. So, I rely on Bob, for example, and will sometimes refer a blog reader’s question to him for a response.</p>

<p><a href="http://blog.lesterpickerphoto.com/wp-content/uploads/2010/09/Les-Costa-Rica-1-of-1.jpg"><img class="size-medium wp-image-589" title="Les-Costa Rica 1 of 1" src="http://blog.lesterpickerphoto.com/wp-content/uploads/2010/09/Les-Costa-Rica-1-of-1-300x199.jpg" alt="" width="300" height="199"></a></p>

<p>But, I think I have enough knowledge about nature, wildlife and landscape photography, as well as diverse experiences in the field, to answer your questions. So, fire away! If I’m not sure of the answer, I’ll ask a colleague to guest answer and/or also throw open the question to readers for their solutions. Go ahead; ask a question. Get the discussions going. I dare you!</p>

		  <div class="entry-content"><p>Right now I’m in the throes of prepping for a month-long assignment that will take me to Australia, Fiji, and New Zealand, three places on my bucket list that I’ve never visited before. As with my recent Canadian Rockies adventure, I plan to blog my way through this.</p>

<p><a href="http://blog.lesterpickerphoto.com/wp-content/uploads/2010/09/newzealandmap_medium_en.jpg"><img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-578" title="newzealandmap_medium_en" src="http://blog.lesterpickerphoto.com/wp-content/uploads/2010/09/newzealandmap_medium_en.jpg" alt="" width="240" height="267"></a></p>

<p>First, if any of you have favorite photo spots in any of these places, please let me know. Our plan is to fly to Sydney and spend several days driving along the coast to Brisbane and back, writing and photographing along the way. Then we’ll cruise from Sydney to Fiji and back, while I teach aboard ship. Next we’ll fly to Melbourne, where I’ll focus (get the bad pun?) on photography along the coast. Finally, we’ll fly to New Zealand’s South Island and spend two weeks photographing, mostly along the southwestern coast in Fjordland National Park and other locations.</p>

<p><a href="http://blog.lesterpickerphoto.com/wp-content/uploads/2010/09/Australia_map_full.jpg"><img class="aligncenter size-medium wp-image-582" title="Australia_map_full" src="http://blog.lesterpickerphoto.com/wp-content/uploads/2010/09/Australia_map_full-300x293.jpg" alt="" width="300" height="293"></a></p>

<p>As a travel and nature photojournalist, the biggest ordeal for me is the preparation. I dread having to make all the flight arrangements, constructing each leg so that it dovetails with the next and often finding that “I can’t get there from here.” Then it’s write down the times and connections, rework it to synch with a flight that only happens twice a week, then rework again because you can’t get back in time for the return flight. There have been times I’ve had to cancel an entire destination because I knew that spending only a day or two would have been too harried and frustrating.</p>

<p><a href="http://blog.lesterpickerphoto.com/wp-content/uploads/2010/09/fiji-map.gif"><img class="aligncenter size-medium wp-image-583" title="fiji-map" src="http://blog.lesterpickerphoto.com/wp-content/uploads/2010/09/fiji-map-300x211.gif" alt="" width="300" height="211"></a></p>

<p>As of now I’ve got our flights on Air Canada arranged. That’s one area of prep I don’t have to agonize over. Air Canada is my little secret. If they fly to where I’m going, I’m usually on one of their planes. Since I’ve been photographing a lot in Canada, I’ve gotten to know them. The flight attendants are friendly and efficient, the planes are clean and I love the fact that every seat on their big jets has a 120-volt receptacle. I can get tons of work done, especially on cross country or international flights.</p>

<p>I’m just six weeks out from the start of the journey and I still haven’t: booked my domestic Australian flights, my flight from Australia to New Zealand, any guides I might hire to get to great photo spots, lodging, or car rentals. I haven’t even finalized the list of places I want to visit for travel writing and/or photography. Damn! Stay tuned.</p>

		  <div class="entry-content"><p>By now you readers know that I only review items that I have actually used, ones that have made my photography job easier… or a living hell! Since I do not allow advertisers on my site, I am beholden to no one and always try to tell it like it is. Of course, I’m always quick to remind you that these reviews only reflect my opinion and you may find the same piece of gear perfect for your needs. Go figure!</p>

<p>With that in mind, here’s my take on Right Angle Viewers (RAV), which I consider an indispensable piece of equipment, especially if you are over 40.</p>

<p>First some background. RAVs screw or clip into the eyepiece of a camera and allow you to view the scene at right angles to the viewer. Every one that I have seen or used allows the RAV to rotate, so you can use it in landscape or portrait mode. Ninety percent of the time you’ll use it by peering down into the RAV from above. But, in rare instances you’ll want to have your camera on a tripod a few inches higher than your head, and a RAV is perfect for that situation, too.</p>

<p>Hoodman (<a href="http://www.hoodmanusa.com">www.hoodmanusa.com</a>) used to make a nice RAV for $130, with adapters for use on just about any DSLR camera. But in September, 2010 they pulled it off the market. They claim they will replace it with an entirely new design sometime in mid-2011, so stay tuned. In the meantime, you can still pick up the Hoodman RAV at photography resellers.</p>

<p>Personally, I use two Nikon RAVs, one for my D300 and one for my D700/D3X. They cost considerably more, but one of them I snagged used at a good price and the other I bought new through eBay and saved $50 off the street price. The thing about RAVs is that they do not enter into the optical path of the image and therefore you really don’t have to be too concerned about their optical quality.</p>

<p><a href="http://blog.lesterpickerphoto.com/wp-content/uploads/2010/09/ASSET_60417.jpg"><img class="size-medium wp-image-572" title="ASSET_60417" src="http://blog.lesterpickerphoto.com/wp-content/uploads/2010/09/ASSET_60417-300x300.jpg" alt="" width="300" height="300"></a></p>

<p><a href="http://blog.lesterpickerphoto.com/wp-content/uploads/2010/09/NKDR5.jpg"><img class="size-medium wp-image-573" title="NKDR5" src="http://blog.lesterpickerphoto.com/wp-content/uploads/2010/09/NKDR5-300x300.jpg" alt="" width="300" height="300"></a></p>

<p>RAVs also have a built-in diopter adjustment so that you can tweak it to your vision. Most also have a switch that flips between 1x magnification and 2x or 2.5x. That’s great for those times when you need critical focus. Just remember when you flip the switch to 2x. More than once I’ve looked at the scene through my RAV and forgot that I was viewing it enlarged two times what the image actually is.</p>

<p>I always carry my two RAVs in the side pouches of my backpack, ready to quickly pull out and use. Here’s a photo that an amateur Swiss photographer, Bruno Stadelmann, took of me using the RAV at Lake Louise, Alberta, Canada. It’s painful enough that I had to contort my body into that position, but imagine if I had to lie on my stomach to get that shot. There’s just no way I could do that nowadays, at least not for a prolonged period of time.</p>

<p><a href="http://blog.lesterpickerphoto.com/wp-content/uploads/2010/09/A74D0850.jpg"><img class="aligncenter size-medium wp-image-586" title="A74D0850" src="http://blog.lesterpickerphoto.com/wp-content/uploads/2010/09/A74D0850-300x199.jpg" alt="" width="300" height="199"></a></p>

<p>As you can imagine, a RAV is ideal for shooting flowers, insects or any low-to-the-ground subject. I also find it absolutely critical for water or stream work, when you cant bend over enough without getting your clothes or equipment soaked. I sometimes use waders to get into a stream with camera and tripod for a well-composed image and my RAV allows me to do that without having to lie down in the stream.</p>

<p>If you are part of the over-the-hill crowd, or just take a lot of macro shots, do yourself a favor and indulge. Your back will sing your praises (not to say your neck, knees and elbows)!</p>

		  <div class="entry-content"><p>How crazy that we spend $5,000 and up on a camera setup (hey, the D3X body alone is $7,500!!) and we can get tripped up by not spending another $8.69?  That is exactly what I spend on a pair of kneepads at Home Depot. Since I use them pretty heavily when I’m out shooting landscapes, I go through them or lose them pretty regularly, so I like to keep the cost under $10 a pair.</p>

<p>I have found that kneepads can make the difference between a mediocre shot and a great one. If you are kneeling on a pebbly beach, there is no way you can stay in one position for long. Patience is a photographic virtue, but tolerating pain shouldn’t be. I also found that once I reached 40, my knees just couldn’t take the stress of being on stones, cement, or even sand for very long. And, if you’re a landscape or wildlife photographer, those are the very elements you face every time you are out on a shoot. Kneepads even help when kneeling on wet grass.</p>

<p>I tend to use the simplest kneepads, only because I find they work best. Here’s what mine look like:</p>

<p><a href="http://blog.lesterpickerphoto.com/wp-content/uploads/2010/09/knee-pads-1-of-31.jpg"><img class="size-medium wp-image-566" title="knee pads 1 of 3" src="http://blog.lesterpickerphoto.com/wp-content/uploads/2010/09/knee-pads-1-of-31-300x199.jpg" alt="" width="300" height="199"></a></p>

<p><a href="http://blog.lesterpickerphoto.com/wp-content/uploads/2010/09/knee-pads-2-of-31.jpg"><img class="aligncenter size-medium wp-image-567" title="knee pads 2 of 3" src="http://blog.lesterpickerphoto.com/wp-content/uploads/2010/09/knee-pads-2-of-31-199x300.jpg" alt="" width="199" height="300"></a></p>

<p><a href="http://blog.lesterpickerphoto.com/wp-content/uploads/2010/09/knee-pads-3-of-31.jpg"><img class="size-medium wp-image-568" title="knee pads 3 of 3" src="http://blog.lesterpickerphoto.com/wp-content/uploads/2010/09/knee-pads-3-of-31-199x300.jpg" alt="" width="199" height="300"></a></p>

<p>The good thing about these pads is that they are very lightweight and flexible. I typically put them on at the beginning of my hike and leave them on all day. If I do take them off, I wrap the Velcro straps around the handle of my backpack and off I go.</p>

<p>I recommend that you do <strong>not</strong> buy the kneepads with the plastic reinforced outer surface. I find that they slip on wet rocks. They are hard to wear for prolonged hikes. They are significantly more expensive. They also make unnecessary tapping and scraping sounds, a definite distraction in wildlife photography and a barrier to making friends with fellow photographers.</p>

<p>I’ve also found that kneepads with the solid elastic back, the ones you have to put your foot through in order to get them on, are worse than useless for photographers. As you hike, they cause long pants to ride up, especially if you wear a high tech fabric. They also gather in the back of the knee and cut off circulation. If you wear them with shorts, the back of your knee will sweat and become chafed. That’s why I prefer the ones with two Velcro straps.</p>

<p>FYI, the type I use is McGuire-Nicholas Soft Cushion Kneepads (Model # 345), but any inexpensive pair you find should work well enough. An accessory like this is hardly ever mentioned in the photography magazines, but is a real boon to pros or advanced amateurs who are out in the field.</p>

		  <div class="entry-content"><p>I thought I’d do a wrap-up of my Canadian Rockies trip. There’s no way to soften this; photographically, it sucked! Oh, I snagged <strong><em>some</em></strong> decent images, but not one-tenth of what I had hoped. But, as far as family-bonding time went, that was wonderful, so I’m really not complaining. Okay, maybe a little bit.</p>

<p>The photography challenge was a combination of rainy weather and forest fires. More than 300 fires were burning in British Columbia during my visit, casting nearly every scene in a brownish haze that not even my Singh-Ray polarizer could cut through. To see some great examples of the hazy conditions, please visit the website of one of my blogging regulars, Cindy Kilpatrick. The British Columbia native and photographer has scads of images of the smoke and haze that enveloped her gorgeous province this summer (<a href="http://missusk76.wordpress.com/2010/08/29/wanted-smell-o-photo/">http://missusk76.wordpress.com/2010/08/29/wanted-smell-o-photo/</a>).</p>

<p>Four of my 14 days were spent on trains. Train travel is great; you get a chance to see the countryside without worrying about the joker tailgating you at 100kph an hour (that’s Canadian for around 60mph, but 100kph sounds more… adventuresome). Dinner is served in a dining car or at your seat, relieving anxiety over which greasy spoon joint the family gets the pleasure of sampling (it’s not the venue that I’m anxious about so much as spending the following 4 hours cramped in an enclosed car suffering the aftereffects of said food venue).</p>

<p>Photography on and from a train, however, is limited. To document my trip as a photojournalist, I took umpteen images of people on the train enjoying themselves; eating, talking, reading, eating, taking photographs from the train, eating. Which brings me to the next point.</p>

<p><a href="http://blog.lesterpickerphoto.com/wp-content/uploads/2010/09/rockiesblog-1-of-1.jpg"><img class="size-medium wp-image-541" title="rockiesblog 1 of 1" src="http://blog.lesterpickerphoto.com/wp-content/uploads/2010/09/rockiesblog-1-of-1-199x300.jpg" alt="" width="199" height="300"></a></p>

<p>Taking photographs <strong><em>from</em></strong> a train ain’t easy. If you’re shooting a DSLR you have an advantage, since you can control more variables such as shutter speed and ISO. With a point-and-shoot your options can be limited. Trains move forward. They roll from side to side. They vibrate. As the train goes through its motions, you are moving, too. Now combine two (or three or four) of those movements and you have what I would call a challenging photography environment (see my blog on “Train Photography” in the <em>Notes from the Field</em> section).</p>

<p><a href="http://blog.lesterpickerphoto.com/wp-content/uploads/2010/09/rockiesblog-1-of-10.jpg"><img class="size-medium wp-image-553 " title="rockiesblog 1 of 10" src="http://blog.lesterpickerphoto.com/wp-content/uploads/2010/09/rockiesblog-1-of-10-300x199.jpg" alt="" width="300" height="199"></a></p>

<p>Now add to my frustration the fact that there was an almost constant haze as we rolled through much of British Columbia (I told you to go to Cindy Kilpatrick’s site, didn’t I?) and you could have heard my blood pressure rising. On the plus side I simply put my cameras away for much of the trip and just enjoyed the scenery and the company of my wife and our 16-year old granddaughter (when she wasn’t in a teen funk, that is).</p>

<p>Another two full days – prime shooting time in Jasper National Park- was spent seeking shelter from the deluge. On our rainy 4-hour drive from Jasper to Moraine Lake we did not see a single bear, moose, elk, deer, or coyote. Speak to anyone who has driven the Icefields Parkway during berry season and they will tell you just how unusual that is. It was certainly a first for me.</p>

<p>I’m already planning a winter trip back to the Canadian Rockies, but that will have to wait until 2011 (more likely 2012), since I’m scheduled to be back in the Yukon this winter.</p>

<p>Now for the highlights of my just completed trip and my recommendations:</p>

<p>The <strong><em>Rocky Mountaineer</em></strong> was a delight from our start in Vancouver to our finish in Jasper. If you go, try to indulge and purchase Gold Leaf service, rather than the Red Leaf. It’ll be well worth it for the extra services and upgraded food.</p>

<p><a href="http://blog.lesterpickerphoto.com/wp-content/uploads/2010/09/rockiesblog-trainfood-1-of-1.jpg"><img class="size-medium wp-image-542" title="rockiesblog-trainfood 1 of 1" src="http://blog.lesterpickerphoto.com/wp-content/uploads/2010/09/rockiesblog-trainfood-1-of-1-199x300.jpg" alt="" width="199" height="300"></a></p>

<p><strong><em>Jasper and Banff National Parks</em></strong>. Look, I’m not saying that we don’t have drop-dead gorgeous parks here in the U.S. But we have to share ours with 300 million other people. Canada, by contrast, has 30 million people and about the same land mass. Do the math. That’s why photographing in Jasper and Banff is usually a pleasure (except for July and August). <em>Best advice</em>: If you’re going to the Canadian Rockies to photograph, you’ve got to pick up Darwin Wiggett’s book, “How to Photograph the Canadian Rockies.”  It’ll be the best travel-related investment you ever made. <em>Hint</em>: <strong>always</strong> carry bear spray with you.</p>

<p><a href="http://blog.lesterpickerphoto.com/wp-content/uploads/2010/09/rockiesblog-5-of-10.jpg"><img class="size-medium wp-image-543" title="Moraine Lake, Alberta" src="http://blog.lesterpickerphoto.com/wp-content/uploads/2010/09/rockiesblog-5-of-10-300x199.jpg" alt="" width="300" height="199"></a></p>

<p>If you plan to visit Moraine Lake, try booking into the <strong><em>Moraine Lake Lodge</em></strong>. I prefer Moraine Lake to its more famous sister, Lake Louise, because the crowds are smaller and the atmosphere at the lake is so spiritual. Be sure to hike the easy trail that goes along the lakeshore to the glacial stream that feeds it.</p>

<p><a href="http://blog.lesterpickerphoto.com/wp-content/uploads/2010/09/rockiesblog-4-of-10.jpg"><img class="size-medium wp-image-544" title="rockiesblog 4 of 10" src="http://blog.lesterpickerphoto.com/wp-content/uploads/2010/09/rockiesblog-4-of-10-199x300.jpg" alt="" width="199" height="300"></a></p>

<p>If your plans include visiting Yoho National Park between Lake Louise and Banff, try to book a room at the reasonably priced <strong><em>Cathedral Mountain Lodge</em></strong>. It’s in an odd location- right next to an interesting and historic series of railroad tunnels- but it has great ambience, food and service to match. The cabins are very well designed and spacious. It&#8217;s biggest draw is that it sits in the midst of Yoho National Park, a mecca for hikers, bikers and kayakers.</p>

<p><a href="http://blog.lesterpickerphoto.com/wp-content/uploads/2010/09/rockiesblog-Takkakaw-1-of-1.jpg"><img class="size-medium wp-image-545" title="rockiesblog-Takkakaw 1 of 1" src="http://blog.lesterpickerphoto.com/wp-content/uploads/2010/09/rockiesblog-Takkakaw-1-of-1-199x300.jpg" alt="" width="199" height="300"></a></p>

<p><strong><em>ViaRail</em></strong> is a less expensive alternative to the Rocky Mountaineer and is the only way to get from Jasper to Port Hardy. There is no dining car and the lone observation car is an older vintage than the newer Rocky Mountaineer with its wrap-around windows. However, the service was excellent, thanks to our attendants, Ron and Bruce.  The scenery is also spectacular when the haze dissipated.</p>

<p><a href="http://blog.lesterpickerphoto.com/wp-content/uploads/2010/09/rockiesblog-7-of-10.jpg"><img class="size-medium wp-image-554" title="rockiesblog 7 of 10" src="http://blog.lesterpickerphoto.com/wp-content/uploads/2010/09/rockiesblog-7-of-10-300x199.jpg" alt="" width="300" height="199"></a></p>

<p>The Prince Rupert to Port Hardy Ferry run by <strong><em>BC Ferries</em></strong> is an incredible experience. The 15-hour journey takes you along the inner passage, so close to the shoreline you could make out bears, elk and moose. The scenery is spectacular as you pass island preserves such as Princess Royal Island, home of the Kermode white spirit bears, all in the safety and comfort of a large ferry.</p>

<p><a href="http://blog.lesterpickerphoto.com/wp-content/uploads/2010/09/rockiesblog-ferry-1-of-1.jpg"><img class="size-medium wp-image-546" title="BC Ferries, Prince Rupert to Port Hardy" src="http://blog.lesterpickerphoto.com/wp-content/uploads/2010/09/rockiesblog-ferry-1-of-1-199x300.jpg" alt="" width="199" height="300"></a></p>

<p><strong><em>Gibsons</em></strong>, an artsy town on the Sunshine coast of British Columbia is a jewel, its busy harbor surrounded as it is by towering mountains. It’s terrific for hiking, biking, kayaking and just plain ambling through town. Great restaurants, too. I love this place.</p>

		  <div class="entry-content"><p>To “ogle” means to look at someone flirtatiously or lasciviously, according to Webster’s. So, I invented the term “oogle” (a takeoff on Google, no doubt) to describe a behavior that many of us landscape photographers do.</p>

<p>Perhaps you’ve seen this in action. A pro photographer takes an image and as soon as it pops up on the LCD, he (or she) whips out a little black device from a belt holster or from around his neck, hunches over perilously close to his LCD screen and just… well… oogles.</p>

<p><a href="http://blog.lesterpickerphoto.com/wp-content/uploads/2010/08/H-LPP30.gif"><img class="size-medium wp-image-533" title="H-LPP30" src="http://blog.lesterpickerphoto.com/wp-content/uploads/2010/08/H-LPP30-300x231.gif" alt="" width="300" height="231"></a></p>

<p>The device in question is Hoodman’s HoodLoupe 3.0, an $80 contraption that I’d absolutely never be without. It’s basically a glorified magnifying lens. It fits perfectly over an LCD screen. For a man like me who has to take off his glasses every time he snaps the shutter and then put them back on to see the camera screen, the HoodLoupe is a lifesaver. Plus, I can see the screen with no glare whatsoever, even in the brightest light. And a +/- 3  diopter focus adjustment allows me to adjust the HoodLoupe perfectly for my eyes.</p>

<p>Some pros make heavy use of Nikon’s Live View feature to adjust critical focus (Cannon has a similar feature), but I often have difficulty using it in very bright light. Instead, I find the HoodLoupe to be helpful. On image review I enlarge the image and can see it with critical detail through the HoodLoupe.</p>

<p>The HoodLoupe comes with a belt carrying pouch and neck strap. I use the belt pouch, since I already have my glasses and a camera strap dangling from my neck.</p>

<p>Hoodman has a short video showing the HoodLoupe in action. Go to:  <a href="http://www.hoodmanusa.com">www.hoodmanusa.com</a>.</p>

		  <div class="entry-content"><p>I recently traveled to Costa Rica, that anomaly of a country where 25% of the land is held in national parks and where eco-consciousness is a way of life, not political posturing.</p>

<p>Two hotels in the capital city of San Jose that I stayed in serve as metaphors for the old versus new way of thinking. The Gran Hotel de Costa Rica is a magnificent structure, built in the heyday of the capital city. It is huge, ornate and, sadly, run down. The marble and wood entryway are impressive, as is the classic restaurant sitting area as one enters.</p>

<p><a href="http://blog.lesterpickerphoto.com/wp-content/uploads/2010/08/images-1.jpeg"><img class="size-full wp-image-521" title="images-1" src="http://blog.lesterpickerphoto.com/wp-content/uploads/2010/08/images-1.jpeg" alt="" width="276" height="182"></a></p>

<p>But, initial impressions are deceiving. Look behind the lobby and you have tiny, claustrophobic rooms with no air conditioning and poor ventilation. The rooms have that tired, worn look and the bathrooms are tiny. It reminded me of the old, long-gone days of the South American renaissance.</p>

<p>Oddly enough, the ground floor restaurant food and service was mediocre, while the lunch buffet on an upstairs floor was excellent and a draw for businesspeople and tourists alike. Go figure!</p>

<p>One thing about San Jose that tourists eager to travel to Costa Rica should know is that it is not a particularly safe city. Wander even a block or two from the main downtown area and you are asking for trouble. Since most tourists are in CR to see the parks and wildlife, that’s usually no problem. Just stay in or right around your hotel. San Jose hotels serve as springboards to eco-tours. You fly in, spend a night getting a good sleep and off you go to see howler monkeys in the wild.</p>

<p>So, after three nights in the Gran, I decided to try something completely different. I booked into the Parque del Lago Hotel Vivo, where I had visited earlier for a business presentation and was impressed by the catering and attentive staff.</p>

<p><a href="http://blog.lesterpickerphoto.com/wp-content/uploads/2010/08/foto-fachada-vaca-creencias.jpg"><img class="size-medium wp-image-528" title="foto fachada vaca, creencias" src="http://blog.lesterpickerphoto.com/wp-content/uploads/2010/08/foto-fachada-vaca-creencias-225x300.jpg" alt="" width="225" height="300"></a></p>

<p>The Parque is a boutique hotel, a smartly executed concept by Ana Alfaro, whose vision of an intimate guest experience for the world traveler is reflected in every aspect of the hotel’s operation. Walk in the door and you know you are entering the future of hospitality in CR. There is nothing pretentious here. The hotel has a fresh look and is immaculately clean. The rooms are, well… roomy. Mine had a windowed, airy, separate seating area that allowed me to do my work in comfort on the couch or at the small desk. The bathroom was freshly scrubbed. And the prices are quite reasonable.</p>

<p><a href="http://blog.lesterpickerphoto.com/wp-content/uploads/2010/08/P5090364.jpg"><img class="size-medium wp-image-525 " title="P5090364" src="http://blog.lesterpickerphoto.com/wp-content/uploads/2010/08/P5090364-225x300.jpg" alt="" width="225" height="300"></a></p>

<p>Each floor carries a separate motif reflecting forest, water and fire, the elemental forces that shaped and are Costa Rica today. The ground floor has engaging informational panels painted onto the walls, explaining the culture and history of CR. A small gift shop reflects the canteenas of old. But, it is in the small and tastefully designed restaurant that the Parque truly shines.</p>

<p>Alfaro brought in Executive chef Pedro Reyes to develop a CR-based cuisine where every bite is a morsel of Valhalla. I feasted on mahi mahi prepared with sliver-fried plantains and a light cream sauce. The palate feel of melt-in-your-mouth fresh fish and crisp plantains was perfectly balanced and the sauce burst open with notes of citrus. The traditional Costa Rican rice and beans was raised to a higher level with the addition of a hint of spicy heat. I ended the meal with a desert aptly named “Plantain in Glory,” a scoop of vanilla ice cream surrounded by sliced, warm plantain cooked in caramel sauce, white wine, cinnamon, and sugar. Even a simple item like coffee was excellent, a strong brew of home-grown beans.</p>

<p>The dining room itself is small, intimate and unpretentious, with nicely designed elements of Costa Rican culture gracing the walls. The soft Latin music was a perfect complement to the dining experience.</p>

<p>One final note; the staff at Parque was exceptional, which I believe reflects Alfaro’s passion. They were helpful without being pushy. They were cheerful and enthusiastic. I found myself wondering when the last time was that I could say that about a hotel staff.</p>

<p>If you’re planning a trip to Costa Rica that includes San Jose, do yourself a favor and treat yourself to the Parque del Lago Hotel Vivo experience. You won’t regret it.</p>

		  <div class="entry-content"><p>Every so often someone sneaks a photo of me. As with many photographers, I’m terribly non-photogenic, so I kinda like it when someone candidly catches me at work in the field. Here I am at exquisite Lake Louise in Alberta, Canada, in a position I often find myself, contorted over a must-have image. In this case the pickings were slim, as it was a cold, rainy, overcast day. I wasn’t even going to bother with a picture. I don’t particularly like Lake Louise for the huge crowds it draws in summer. Just then the sun tried to break through (it never really did), and I quickly got to work.</p>

<p>Lucky for me, Bruno and Angie Stadelmann from Riehen, Switzerland were passing by. Bruno is an avid amateur photographer and, unbeknownst to me, grabbed this shot. Thanks, Bruno!</p>

<p>(BTW, here is one of the images that I was taking when Bruno wandered by. It will be one of several images that I may combine into a panorama. With the lousy weather, however, there are absolutely no reflections in the water, so I may just can the whole thing. Stay tuned).</p>

		  <div class="entry-content"><p>We’re sitting on the aft deck of the Northern Expedition, a BC Ferry en route from Prince Rupert to Port Hardy, British Columbia, Canada, when I notice my granddaughter, bless her 16-year old heart, staring at my hands, which were at that moment, clutching my camera and a telephoto lens.</p>

<p>“Pop-pop,” she says, perfectly seriously. “I think you should be a hand model for AARP.” Then she bursts out laughing.</p>

<p>So, my question for you, dear reader’s, is this: Is she right? (Please be kind!)</p>

		  <div class="entry-content"><p>Right now it’s the mid-afternoon lull, the time when any decent photographer is bone tired, having arisen before dawn to snag those incredible sunrise images. I’m onboard the Northern Expedition, a British Columbia ferry traveling between Prince Rupert and Port Hardy, a 15-hour journey through the spectacular Queen Charlotte Islands of the Canadian Pacific coast. God, they’re beautiful! Dense evergreen forest covers the mountains from summit to sea as we weave through narrow channels along our 500km route.</p>

<p>Actually, I didn’t get any sunrise pics, but I’ve got an excuse a notch better than “the dog ate my homework.” I had to get up at 4:45 in order to be at the ferry terminal in sleepy Prince Rupert by 5:30. No one I asked was able to explain to me why all passengers had to be there by 5:30 when the ferry didn’t leave until 7:30, but rules are rules and here’s where the Canadians betray their British roots (hey, Queen Elizabeth is still officially the Queen of Canada).</p>

<p>So far we’ve traveled from Maryland, USA by plane to Vancouver, then via train on a 2-day wonderful rail trip on the Rocky Mountaineer to Jasper, Alberta (see my previous blog on that train trip) where we rented a car and spent 4 days photographing the incredible landscape (actually it was 1-1/2 days, as it rained hard the rest of the time). Then it was on to Prince Rupert, again by train, but this time with Canada’s ViaRail system. Now it’s ferry time.</p>

<p>I can’t photograph now because the afternoon sun has flattened the landscape into a shapeless pastiche. That, and the fact that major forest fires in British Columbia have laid a blanket of haze over the land. So, a perfect time to blog, this time on the topic of photographing onboard ship, not so much instructional as observational.</p>

<p><a href="http://blog.lesterpickerphoto.com/wp-content/uploads/2010/08/BC-Ferries-12009-08-18.jpg"><img class="size-medium wp-image-500" title="BC Ferries 12009-08-18" src="http://blog.lesterpickerphoto.com/wp-content/uploads/2010/08/BC-Ferries-12009-08-18-200x300.jpg" alt="" width="200" height="300"></a></p>

<p>Ferries are noisy ships, since they depend on significant horsepower to power hundreds of cars, passengers, crew and supplies. You can feel the vibration of the engines clear into your bones no matter where on deck you stand. But, the human body is an amazing organism and our very bulk and loose connections between bones absorb some of that vibration. And so my first lesson, if you will. Don’t lean against a wall or, worse yet, put your elbows on the railings to stabilize your shots. You’ll simply serve as a vibration transmission machine (VTM, in scientific parlance) and wonder why your shots are fuzzy or blurry.</p>

<p>That very naturally leads to the second lesson, which is that a tripod is less than totally useless on a ferry (or most other boats). I watched a young man mount a video camera atop a rather flimsy tripod. Even at a distance I could see the danged thing vibrating. The tripod, being a fairly rigid piece of metal, a very useful characteristic on solid land, is simply a VTM on steroids. And with no muscle, fat, tendons or ligaments, it transmits VTM faster than a sick kid does his cold virus to his daycare buddies.</p>

<p>The solution? Hand-hold your camera, elbows at sides. Shoot at 1/250 or faster. Open the aperture to f8 or wider (f5.6, 4, 3.5, 2.8), which usually is not a problem since most water landscapes are at a distance and depth of field may not matter quite so much. If that doesn’t help, dig deep into your camera menus and raise your ISO (assuming your point-and-shoot allows that). If you have a simpler point-and-shoot that doesn’t allow ISO adjustment, and it has a sports mode, try it. Sports mode is designed to allow you to shoot at a faster shutter speed to capture action.</p>

<p>One final observation. Straps. Use them wisely. Here’s what I mean. Probably 95% of the people I saw using their cameras, DSLRs as well as point-and-shoots, didn’t have the strap around their hand or neck. Come on folks! A strap is the cheapest form of insurance you’ll ever have!</p>

<p><a href="http://blog.lesterpickerphoto.com/wp-content/uploads/2010/08/BC-Ferries-22009-08-18.jpg"><img class="size-medium wp-image-501" title="BC Ferries 22009-08-18" src="http://blog.lesterpickerphoto.com/wp-content/uploads/2010/08/BC-Ferries-22009-08-18-199x300.jpg" alt="" width="199" height="300"></a></p>

<p>On the other hand, a strap can be a major liability. Here’s how. I walked through the ferry’s cafeteria and saw half-a-dozen folks put their cameras on the table, the strap dangling down. It seems to me that’s inviting disaster. I was once on the Big Island of Hawaii and saw a man place his high-end Cannon DSLR with a 500mm lens on the tailgate of his SUV. That, by the way, represented a $15,000 investment, minimum. The strap was hanging down. He reached into the SUV to retrieve his camera bag and as he pulled away, the bag caught his camera strap and pulled it to the ground.</p>

<p>To this day I can’t understand why that guy didn’t get down on his knees, crying, his arms outstretched to the lens, which was scattered into at least 350 pieces on the gravel. But it etched into my mind what my father thankfully drummed into my head when he gave me my first camera. NEVER let your camera strap hang carelessly, even for a second.</p>

		  <div class="entry-content"><p>First, to be clear, I’m talking here about taking photos on and from a train, not of a train. There are lots of train enthusiasts out there and I’m often blown away by the quality of the better amateur and pro train photographers. I love grainy black and whites of trains, old train stations, even the expressions of people waiting in stations for their trains. But I’m not a train photographer.</p>

<p><a href="http://blog.lesterpickerphoto.com/wp-content/uploads/2010/08/CanadianRockiesLoop2010-ViaRail-Jasper-PrinceRupert-22010-08-11.jpg"><img class="size-medium wp-image-483" title="CanadianRockiesLoop2010-ViaRail-Jasper-PrinceRupert 22010-08-11" src="http://blog.lesterpickerphoto.com/wp-content/uploads/2010/08/CanadianRockiesLoop2010-ViaRail-Jasper-PrinceRupert-22010-08-11-199x300.jpg" alt="" width="199" height="300"></a></p>

<p>So on this Grand Loop trip I’m taking, I face the challenge of getting decent photos on and from a moving train, which for me is a real pain. First are scenes onboard the train. Okay, that’s not too bad. The inside of the train tends to be in shadow, while the outside is usually bright. That creates severe contrast problems and balancing exposure is tricky.</p>

<p>As a landscape and nature photographer, I always try to use a low ISO, almost always no higher than 200. I want as much fine detail as my sensor can give me. But a train is constantly rocking and rolling and the wheels transmit vibrations to the cars. I find myself having to shoot at ISO 400 and even 800 on occasion in order to get a fast enough shutter speed to capture the onboard action, like images of the chef preparing meals or people enjoying themselves.</p>

<p>I also use a tripod for probably 75% of my outdoor work, but on a train, of course, that’s impossible and would add no real advantage due to the train movements.</p>

<p><a href="http://blog.lesterpickerphoto.com/wp-content/uploads/2010/08/CanadianRockiesLoop2010-ViaRail-Jasper-PrinceRupert-32010-08-11.jpg"><img class="size-medium wp-image-485" title="CanadianRockiesLoop2010-ViaRail-Jasper-PrinceRupert 32010-08-11" src="http://blog.lesterpickerphoto.com/wp-content/uploads/2010/08/CanadianRockiesLoop2010-ViaRail-Jasper-PrinceRupert-32010-08-11-300x199.jpg" alt="" width="300" height="199"></a></p>

<p>Shooting outdoor scenes on a train is equally challenging. Aside from train movements and your own body shakes, now you’ve got constantly changing light to deal with, changes that are far different than I face as a landscape artist. Usually shifting patterns of light are gradual (note I said usually). On a train, the light changes come at you at 50 or 60 miles per hour.</p>

<p>A train spends a huge chunk of its time traveling in tunnels; not the ones that go through mountains, but the ones that are the natural outgrowth of a train traveling on set tracks. Trees grow up alongside the tracks, forming corridors that seem always to be impinging on shots. You see a scene, you rush to frame it, fiddle with the aperture and speed and just when you press the shutter a row of tall trees barrels into view.</p>

<p>In any event, the name of the game for train shooting is speed. With today’s sensors on DSLRs, you can shoot at ISO 400 or 800 with few problems. On a point-and-shoot the problems of shooting aboard a train may be thornier. If you have a high-end point-and-shoot, try upping the ISO and see if you can shoot in Aperture-priority mode. If you have the ability to change the aperture, then switch to a wider aperture. You may lose some depth of field, but rescue the shot.</p>

<p><a href="http://blog.lesterpickerphoto.com/wp-content/uploads/2010/08/CanadianRockiesLoop2010-ViaRail-Jasper-PrinceRupert-62010-08-15.jpg"><img class="size-medium wp-image-487" title="CanadianRockiesLoop2010-ViaRail-Jasper-PrinceRupert 62010-08-15" src="http://blog.lesterpickerphoto.com/wp-content/uploads/2010/08/CanadianRockiesLoop2010-ViaRail-Jasper-PrinceRupert-62010-08-15-199x300.jpg" alt="" width="199" height="300"></a></p>

<p>Another challenge is fellow passengers, who will often vie for choice positions at the railings. My best advice: be nice. Get to your spot early, take your pics, and then offer your spot to another shooter.</p>

<p>Anyway, shooting on a train gives you one commodity that’s usually in short supply… time. You’re stuck on a track, usually with no Internet and sometimes no phone service. My Canadian train adventures lasted 8-10 hours a day for 4 days total. So, I used the time to play around with my camera. Excuse me, I mean I experimented. I tried using the speed and shaking to my advantage. I first started with a slow shutter speed (1/4 to ½ second) as the train whizzed past trees.</p>

<p><a href="http://blog.lesterpickerphoto.com/wp-content/uploads/2010/08/CanadianRockiesLoop2010-ViaRail-Jasper-PrinceRupert-72010-08-15.jpg"><img class="aligncenter size-medium wp-image-488" title="CanadianRockiesLoop2010-ViaRail-Jasper-PrinceRupert 72010-08-15" src="http://blog.lesterpickerphoto.com/wp-content/uploads/2010/08/CanadianRockiesLoop2010-ViaRail-Jasper-PrinceRupert-72010-08-15-300x199.jpg" alt="" width="300" height="199"></a></p>

<p>Then I added a polarizer, lowered the ISO as low as my camera permitted, and shot for up to 2 seconds.</p>

<p><a href="http://blog.lesterpickerphoto.com/wp-content/uploads/2010/08/CanadianRockiesLoop2010-ViaRail-Jasper-PrinceRupert-82010-08-15.jpg"><img class="size-medium wp-image-489" title="CanadianRockiesLoop2010-ViaRail-Jasper-PrinceRupert 82010-08-15" src="http://blog.lesterpickerphoto.com/wp-content/uploads/2010/08/CanadianRockiesLoop2010-ViaRail-Jasper-PrinceRupert-82010-08-15-300x199.jpg" alt="" width="300" height="199"></a></p>

<p>Finally, I used a variable neutral density filter made by Singh Ray to stretch my exposures out to 5 seconds.</p>

<p>I like the next one. As I was taking the image, an old cabin moved into view. Click on the image to see it sized larger.</p>

<p>I’d love to hear from you readers about your reactions to my &#8220;experiment&#8221; and about your train photo experiences.</p>

<p>Happy training!</p>

		  <div class="entry-content"><p>We’re on a two-day train trip from Vancouver, British Columbia to Jasper, Alberta, what many of my fellow passengers are calling the trip of a lifetime. This trip I’m joined by my wife and granddaughter and we are aboard the Rocky Mountaineer, an upscale riding experience that winds through some of the most spectacular scenery in the world, a never-ending smorgasbord of mountain, stream and meadow eye-candy.</p>

<p><a href="http://blog.lesterpickerphoto.com/wp-content/uploads/2010/08/CanadianRockiesLoop2010-Rocky-Mountaineer-2010-08-10.jpg"><img class="size-medium wp-image-473" title="CanadianRockiesLoop2010-Rocky Mountaineer 2010-08-10" src="http://blog.lesterpickerphoto.com/wp-content/uploads/2010/08/CanadianRockiesLoop2010-Rocky-Mountaineer-2010-08-10-199x300.jpg" alt="" width="199" height="300"></a></p>

<p>For me, one of the joys of travel is chatting with my travel mates and, in the case of the Rocky Mountaineer, I find myself talking with folks from England, Germany, Israel, Canada and all over the U.S.</p>

<p>The Rocky Mountaineer offers two levels of service; Red Leaf and Gold Leaf. Both sport a comfortable ride, nice seating and plenty of room. But the Gold Leaf service seriously amps the juice. Meals are created by a 4-person team for each car individually. In our case Christos Chaldeos, a 25-year old culinary school graduate, managed our kitchen… and did it with aplomb. Individually prepared, hot meals rule, with suitable attention to garnishes and presentation. The wait staff is incredibly attentive.</p>

<p><a href="http://blog.lesterpickerphoto.com/wp-content/uploads/2010/08/CanadianRockiesLoop2010-Rocky-Mountaineer-2010-08-11.jpg"><img class="size-medium wp-image-475" title="CanadianRockiesLoop2010-Rocky Mountaineer 2010-08-11" src="http://blog.lesterpickerphoto.com/wp-content/uploads/2010/08/CanadianRockiesLoop2010-Rocky-Mountaineer-2010-08-11-200x300.jpg" alt="" width="200" height="300"></a></p>

<p>Life aboard a train quickly falls into a routine. The clacking rhythm of the wheels on the rails, the gentle swaying and the excellent meals together threaten to lull me to sleep. I have to strain to get up to photograph the train experience and the scenery or to type my notes. I’m not sure about the rest of you, but I find shooting from a train to be an exercise in frustration. The train is moving and rocking and vibrating, making proper exposure a dicey situation. Then I get frustrated by the trees, poles and other stuff in the way of my shots. Each car has an outside platform from where you can shoot, but it’s always got 6-10 people out there jockeying for position and conspiring to ruin my shot.</p>

<p>The first day we traveled from Vancouver to Kamloops, a ten-hour ride through the industrial outskirts of Vancouver, through farmland and slight mountains, past copper mines, bald eagles and ospreys. It was a long day, but thoroughly enjoyable.</p>

<p><a href="http://blog.lesterpickerphoto.com/wp-content/uploads/2010/08/CanadianRockiesLoop2010-Rocky-Mountaineer-2010-08-10-1.jpg"><img class="aligncenter size-medium wp-image-477" title="CanadianRockiesLoop2010-Rocky Mountaineer 2010-08-10 (1)" src="http://blog.lesterpickerphoto.com/wp-content/uploads/2010/08/CanadianRockiesLoop2010-Rocky-Mountaineer-2010-08-10-1-300x199.jpg" alt="typical Rocky Mountaineer view" width="300" height="199"></a>The second day we traveled from Kamloops to Jasper. Now here was scenery! Not an hour out of Kamloops we started climbing from 1,200 feet to 3,000 feet by 3:00 PM, and 3,500 feet by time we arrive. The mountains loom 10,000 feet above us, showing off their icy glaciers and mint-green alpine meadows. What an incredible show!</p>

<p>I was in Jasper and Banff National Parks last fall and the train ride has only wetted my appetite to be back and capture some of the amazing landscapes and wildlife. Tonight we’ll be in the town of Jasper and tomorrow we’ll be driving along the spectacular Icefields Parkway oohing and aahing all the way to Banff.</p>

<p>FOOTNOTE: It rained heavily the entire drive from Jasper to Banff. Not one wildlife sighting and the mountains that surrounded us were hidden from view due to the fog and rain. But, we finally made it to Moraine Lodge and I’ll report on that in tomorrow’s blog (assuming I can find a decent Internet connection!).</p>

		  <div class="entry-content"><p>Okay, prep time is finally over and we’re off on our Canadian Rockies adventure. Normally I’d be traveling alone if I were on assignment, but in this case I happily have my wife and granddaughter accompanying me so that I can write some travel articles from a family and, specifically, an intergenerational perspective.</p>

<p>I love travel, but I hate traveling. Travel has become such a hassle in the past decade. As if the airlines weren’t bad enough on their own, the security hassles alternate between ridiculous and absurd. Drag suitcases down the stairs, into the car, out of the car, onto the shuttle bus, off the shuttle bus, onto the ticket counter scale. Now, wait 30 minutes in line, take off the shoes and belt, empty pockets, take out laptop, shuffle through security.</p>

<p>“Hey, that’s a lot of camera equipment you have,” the TSA agent asks, suspiciously  (what, they’ve never seen cameras and lenses before?). Open the bag, remove the cameras and lenses, disassemble, show them to the officer, repack them, re-dress and you’re on your way. Have a pleasant flight!</p>

<p><a href="http://blog.lesterpickerphoto.com/wp-content/uploads/2010/08/CanadianRockiesLoop2010-BWI-42010-08-09.jpg"><img class="size-medium wp-image-459" title="CanadianRockiesLoop2010-BWI 42010-08-09" src="http://blog.lesterpickerphoto.com/wp-content/uploads/2010/08/CanadianRockiesLoop2010-BWI-42010-08-09-300x199.jpg" alt="" width="300" height="199"></a></p>

<p>For those of you who haven’t yet sampled Baltimore Washington International Thurgood Marshall Airport’s international terminal, well, consider keeping it that way. It’s tiny and the amenities, if that’s what they call them, are sparse. We arrived at 7:45 A.M. for a 9:30 flight. There are 3 commercial properties in the entire terminal: a duty-free shop that mainly peddles alcohol, a Hudson News magazine stand and Formaggio, essentially a bar with some tables. Fortunately, the bar also sells microwave egg and cheese sandwiches, choice of bagel, English muffin or croissant and your salt loading for the day.</p>

<p>Actually, the flight itself was pleasant. Air Canada has its act together and runs smoothly out of BWI. Its flight attendants are actually attendant. All in all, a very pleasant flight. I travel to Canada a lot and I always find friendlier skies over Canada.</p>

<p>BWI to Toronto, then on to Vancouver. I love Vancouver. Great city, great sites, terrific parks and ethnic restaurants up the wazoo, befitting the international city it is. I love seeing the Pacific and mountains in the same view. We stayed at the Sheraton Wall Centre, a perfect downtown location.</p>

<p>We ate dinner at Azia, a slightly upscale Asian restaurant jut off the corner of Burrard and Smithe. Open just four years. Great menu. High energy, accommodating wait staff. We started with 3 rejuvenating pots of green tea , followed by an appetizer of dim sum shrimp with spicy sauce. That was followed by two dishes that the three of us shared; General Tsao’s Shrimp and Seafood Curry Hot Pot. The shrimp was perfectly fried, crisp with a sauce that had just enough bite to let you know you had tasted something special. The hit pot had shrimp, scallops, green beans, and eggplant, all swimming in a curry sauce to die for. On the side we added coconut rice, steamed and wrapped in a banana leaf. Azia is now a new Vancouver favorite. The total tab was $51.00.</p>

<p>It’s an early night tonight. Tomorrow we get up early to be at the Rocky Mountaineer train by 7:00 A.M. for our trip to Jasper and Banff. Stay tuned!</p>

<p>by Lester Picker</p>

<p>[This article originally appeared in <em>The Baltimore Sun</em> Travel section.]</p>

<p>The ringing in my ears has finally stopped. Only now, for the first time since I arrived 36 hours ago, can I hear the true sound of The Great Sakhara, Egypt’s Eastern Desert. Silence. Utter, absolute, total quiet. A silence far, far deeper than even Thoreau’s New England forest solitude.</p>

<p>In the desolate landscape of The Great Sakhara there are no tree leaves to rustle in the wind. In fact, other than for a short time in the morning and evening, there is no wind. Trees, like the acacia, are few and laced with thorns and rigid, needle-like leaves. There are no sounds of babbling brooks. No crickets chirping. No car engines in the distance or airplanes buzzing overhead. Just a silence like I have never experienced before in my life, a stillness that strips away the noisy veneer of our twenty-first century existence and penetrates to one’s core.</p>

<p>On the surface, I have come to this desert to research material for a book I am writing. But, I soon realize that this immense tract of barren sands, with its deeply etched mountains and boulder-strewn wadis has its own agenda. Sheikh Abdel Zaher Soliman, my guide and a Bedouin leader of the Ma’aza tribe of the Khushmaan clan knows this. He has waited patiently for its effects to take hold on me. I tell him with wonder what has just happened to me and he smiles, one of the many smiles of acknowledgement I will see on his face over the next few days. Abdel Zaher tells me that those infrequent visitors who do come here carry inside their heads the noises from where they came. And then The Great Sakhara works its magic.</p>

<h3>An inauspicious beginning</h3>


<p><a href="http://blog.lesterpickerphoto.com/wp-content/uploads/2010/07/egypt-1-of-5.jpg"><img class="size-medium wp-image-403" title="eastern desert bedouin" src="http://blog.lesterpickerphoto.com/wp-content/uploads/2010/07/egypt-1-of-5-225x300.jpg" alt="" width="225" height="300"></a></p>

<p>I found out about Abdel Zaher (pronounced Abdel Zahr) through a colleague who spent years living with the Bedouins. But, finding Abdel Zaher in concept and finding him in the flesh are two different things. He has no real address, other than a neighborhood at the edge of the Red Sea resort town of Hurghada.</p>

<p>I finally located his house by asking several people in the neighborhood. I arrived at 1:00 on a hot afternoon, about an hour behind schedule. I was greeted by one of Abdel Zaher’s 15 children, who brought me inside to meet Mona Farouk, one of Abdel Zaher’s two wives, a gracious woman who welcomed me warmly.</p>

<p>Abdel Zaher, she explained, was “in the desert.” He would return when he returned. Period. Sit down, eat, make yourself comfortable. In the four hours spent in their modest house, I was introduced to more than half his children and many relatives. The children flow freely from one mother’s household to the other, and each refers to both women as their mother. A little after 5:00 that evening, Abdel Zaher appeared, amidst much fanfare.</p>

<p>Abdel Zaher Soliman is a small, sinewy and very, very proud Bedouin, the last of a dying breed of nomadic people. His father was a revered Bedouin leader and as a child and young man Abdel Zaher grew up roaming the Eastern Desert from the Nile River to the Red Sea along a wide swath traditionally belonging to his clan. Now, as more and more Bedouins opt for life in small cities, Abdel Zaher makes his living as a desert guide for people serious about learning the desert’s ways. Unfortunately, Abdel Zaher speaks no English, although I suspect that he knows a few words but simply refuses to use them.</p>

<p>The next morning, we started early, buying fresh fruits, vegetables, breads and cheeses for the trek. Since Bedouins eat meat infrequently, and I am a vegetarian, we finish at the souk in less than 30 minutes, throwing the provisions and our gear into the back of Abdel Zaher’s battered, front-wheel drive Toyota pickup.</p>

<p>Driving out of Hurghada, the stark desert mountains to the west loom into view, larger and more forbidding with every passing mile. Abdel Zaher starts a dialogue that will form the basis of our communications, and one that will improve my Arabic language skills immensely over the next four days. When he explains something he stops and asks if I understand him. If not, he patiently, softly, repeats himself, drawing objects in the sand, or gesturing until I understand him clearly. I write down words and expressions that are new to me, which pleases him greatly.</p>

<p>Ninety minutes into the drive we reach a “Bedouin village” staged for day-trek tourists, although several of Abdel Zaher’s family and friends actually do live there, in a section off-limits to tourists. Like two of Abdel Zaher’s relatives I met in his house, I notice that several of the children are deaf mutes, the result of inbreeding. When I ask Abdel Zaher about it, he explains that is Allah’s way, but that all people within the tribe contribute to daily chores and are loved, an acceptance I see repeatedly throughout my stay. We sip tea with a friend of his father’s, then leave to drive another six hours into the deep desert.</p>

<p><strong>The Eastern Desert</strong></p>

<p>The Ma’aza tribe traditionally roamed an area of some 56,000 square miles, roughly the size of the state of Indiana, occupying about 8.5% of Egypt’s land mass. The area is so inhospitable, it has one of the lowest population densities on earth, fewer than one person per sixty square miles. It has not rained in the Eastern Desert for five long years. Yet, even when it does, annual rainfall averages about one-tenth of an inch. During summer, temperatures can reach over 110 degrees Fahrenheit for days and nights at a time. During winter, when I am here, temperatures can reach 90 degrees during the day and plummet to freezing at night.</p>

<p><a href="http://blog.lesterpickerphoto.com/wp-content/uploads/2010/08/egypt-desert-1-of-1.jpg"><img class="size-medium wp-image-439" title="eastern desert" src="http://blog.lesterpickerphoto.com/wp-content/uploads/2010/08/egypt-desert-1-of-1-259x300.jpg" alt="" width="259" height="300"></a></p>

<p>Driving in the Eastern Desert is an endless series of detours. The mountains are so steep, rising in places to more than 7,000 feet, and so impossibly rugged and devoid of plants, they cannot be traversed easily by foot or at all by vehicle. So, driving from one point to another involves traveling in the dry river and sea beds, known as wadis. You travel from one sand and rock-strewn wadi to another to get around a mountain. Since a wadi might be miles long, the process is a first rate geography lesson in why caravan routes were so important and well defined in ancient cultures. In an environment where temperatures can be so brutal, you had better know intimately where water, game and good shelter can be found.</p>

<p>The Eastern Desert’s mountains were also the source of much of ancient Egypt’s gold, although their uncanny ability to discover and mine the precious metal left subsequent prospectors high and dry. A recently discovered, 2,900 year old papyrus pinpoints the location of the old Pharaonic mines and a new venture is seeking to extract gold from those deposits.</p>

<p>At a watering hole, I ask Abdel Zaher about another valuable resource, the Nubian goats that are ever-present in Bedouin camps. He explains to me the process of making water bags from goat skins. Since resources are so precious to a subsistence people, the goat is fully utilized, from the hide (think not-yet-prime-time Gucci bags) and meat (usually only on festive occasions), to the horns (medicine containers, knife handles and decorations), and sinew (for sewing).</p>

<p>As we drive through the heat and dust, I notice isolated trees here and there, scattered unpredictably in the sun-baked wadis. These are acacia trees, made famous in antiquity by the ancient Egyptians who utilized every part of this valuable resource. The spiny leaves of every orange-trunked tree we pass is eaten up to the reach of camels.</p>

<p>Finally, after a full day of driving, taking notes and photographing the striking beauty of the desolate landscape, Abdel Zaher chooses a spot to make camp. With the sun beginning its long process of setting behind the mountains, I help Abdel Zaher pick some dried brush, which he breaks up and carefully arranges in the firepit. He then scoops up a large pile of dried camel dung, each oval pellet about the size of a prune, into his robe and dumps them into the firepit, then lights the mixture with a match. The dung makes a great fire and I find, much to my surprise, smells good, too.</p>

<p>With the fire now generating the hot coals Abdel Zaher will need to cook in, I’m able to relax and I turn to see the sun setting behind the mountains to our west. The sunlight, filtered through desert dust, paints a canvas of warm reds and vivid oranges that are breathtaking, bathing the eastern mountains of our wadi in a warm golden glow .</p>

<p><strong>Dinner for two</strong></p>

<p>With the light fast fading, we eat a meal of beans and spices, known as fool, heated in a small pot on the edge of the coals. We take turns scooping up portions of the flavorful beans with pieces of whole wheat pita bread, called eish baladi, heated by throwing them into the coals for a few seconds (yes, camel dung and all) to warm them up. We also dip our bread into a creamy feta cheese and munch on fresh vegetables.</p>

<p>As soon as we finish dinner, Abdel Zaher quietly moves away from the fire, turns toward Mecca, and begins his evening prayers. I marvel at the intimate connections this man has with his environment and his God.</p>

<p><strong>Turning in</strong></p>

<p>By 8:00 PM, we are more than ready for sleep. Abdel Zaher makes a semi-circular windbreak from dried brush to shelter us from the evening winds that will soon begin. We prepare the sand, Abdel Zaher’s colorful, woolen Bedouin blankets and my sleeping bag and climb in. But, as the night sky darkens to pitch black, I am awed by the crystal-clear light show taking place overhead. Abdel Zaher draws in the sand for me how the Bedouins use the rotation of the constellations to follow the seasons. He also points out to me a diffuse light source on the horizon that I would never have noticed on my own. It is the lights from Luxor, some 200 kilometers away. When he was a child, the desert was truly black at night, he sighs.</p>

<p>We also discuss religion and Abdel Zaher’s intolerance for Muslim fundamentalists who believe that there is only one way to know God. I fall asleep, content, as the gentle winds begin to flow across the desert floor.</p>

<p>Suddenly, after midnight, I am awakened by what seems like someone shining a flashlight in my eyes. It is the moon, shining so brightly, it lights up the entire wadi, bathing the surrounding mountains in a bright glow, as if someone had simply turned on a light switch. I also notice that the temperature has plummeted to just above freezing. I am finding it hard to keep warm and even my eyes hurt from the intense cold. I pull a spare t-shirt over my eyes and head to keep warm.</p>

<p><strong>Day 2</strong></p>

<p>At sunrise, I open my eyes to mountains bathed in a smoky, ethereal glow, lit in soft, warm copper tones by the early morning sun. Silence again. Total and complete silence, punctuated by Abdel Zaher’s regular breathing.</p>

<p>As Abdel Zaher prepares a simple breakfast for us, I note his slow and deliberate movements, a practice reinforced by an unforgiving environment where any mistake can be fatal. I am beginning to understand how the Eastern Desert afforded the ancient Egyptians such secure protection from invaders.</p>

<p>Abdel Zaher is eager to show me a special sight, so we soon pack and leave our campsite. As we drive, he is always telling me exactly where we are by naming each mountain, each wadi, each water hole. Knowing the names of geographical landmarks is critical in The Great Sakhara, because to give wrong directions can and has often meant death from dehydration. In his quiet voice, Abdel Zaher tells me he knows many people who have died this way. Along popular caravan routes, rock cairns, which the Bedouin call “rriggin,” mark trails to water or trade routes.</p>

<p>But, the naming process is made easier by one of the most unique aspects of the Eastern Desert. Its barren mountains are one of four distinct and separate colors, a striking feature that is riveting. Green, red, black and white mountains dominate one or another section of desert,  the sand surrounding them reflecting their color. Yet the tones of those colors are ever-changing, as the sun moves across the sky.</p>

<p><strong>The acacia preserve</strong></p>

<p>It is now 5:00 PM and it is still 85 degrees, but I’m not sweating due to the dry desert air. But I am shivering a bit, because I am walking in one of the most unique spots of the Eastern Desert, a grove of some 1,200 acacia trees that the Bedouins have self-designated as a preserve. Concerned about overuse of the valuable trees, the grove stands as a silent reminder of similar groves that once dotted the desert but are no more.</p>

<p>But this grove is so spiritual, so elegant in its simple beauty, I am reminded of a Japanese Zen garden, except this one is in the middle of nowhere, completely surrounded by towering mountains in all four colors.  While Abdel Zaher prays, I meditate on a ridge overlooking the acacia grove.</p>

<p>Today has been a wonderful day, full of learning about water sources, mountains and folk medicines made from plants. As night falls, I feel more attuned to the natural rhythm of the desert and to my own internal rhythm. I eagerly await the starry light show, but before I know it, my eyes close and reopen to the sun peeking above the nearby mountain.</p>

<p><strong>Day 3: Tracking an Ibex</strong></p>

<p>I start the day cleaning my cameras from the sand dust that covers everything here. Following a breakfast of tea, bread and cheese, we are off. In an hour, Abdel Zaher stops the truck, peers into the distance and gets out. We walk for about 15 minutes to the base of a mountain, where he stoops down and points out to me a set of tracks.</p>

<p>There have been gazelles here recently, he says, and an Ibex was here within the past hour, in all probability scared off by the sounds of our truck. He looks up at the mountain, and motions me back to the truck.</p>

<p>In a few minutes we stop along a ridge and I see a group of gazelles running across the wadi, perhaps a half-mile from us. They are a beautiful sight, with their tan shoulders and white underbellies, leaping and darting across the desert floor faster than I could have imagined.</p>

<p>Seeing my excitement, Abdel Zaher asks if I want to see an Ibex. We ride to the back of the mountain where he had first spotted the tracks and begin to climb. By mid-morning, Abdel Zaher motions for me to crouch and be quiet. He points. On a rock face some 100 feet ahead and above us is an incredible sight, a lone male Ibex, perched precariously on a rocky outcropping. We spend the next couple of hours following and photographing this perfect specimen.</p>

<p><strong>Lessons in humanity and the divine</strong></p>

<p>As each day’s adventures merged into the next, I began to settle into the desert experience and extract from it the lessons I had come to learn. Paramount among them is the relationship between the desert and its Bedouin people, an intricately interwoven connection that is both deep and profound.</p>

<p>One night I asked Abdel Zaher if he would come to America to visit me, so I could repay his being such a gracious host to me. “You must not have big deserts there,” he quietly told me, “because Americans come here to study The Great Sakhara. If you don’t have a desert like this, why would I want to go there?”</p>

<p>The relationship between the Bedouins and their environment is intertwined with their deep spiritual beliefs. Perhaps it is the time they have to contemplate, but I found the strong personal connections that Bedouins feel to God to be inclusive. Sitting by the fire one evening, Abdel Zaher confided in me his disdain for fundamentalist Muslim clerics who preach intolerance. “What difference is it if you are People of the Book (Jews) or Christians? We all worship Allah. Everyone should be left to do that as they wish.”</p>

<p><a href="http://blog.lesterpickerphoto.com/wp-content/uploads/2010/07/egypt-5-of-5.jpg"><img class="size-medium wp-image-406 " title="eastern desert" src="http://blog.lesterpickerphoto.com/wp-content/uploads/2010/07/egypt-5-of-5-195x300.jpg" alt="" width="156" height="240"></a></p>

<p>Late in the afternoon, I spotted a cave high up on a mountain. I asked Abdel Zaher if he would stop, so I could climb to it. He smiled and stopped, staying behind while I climbed up. The cave was certainly appealing from the ground, but it was absolutely awesome as I approached. A huge, nearly perfectly arched entranceway framed the shallow cave. The path going up and the floor of the cave itself was littered with ibex scat. The cave, some 700 feet up, had bat guano on its walls. A few broken branches littered the floor in one spot. But, it was the view from the cave that took my breath away. I was looking out over a panorama of desert wadi, framed by rugged mountains that had taken us over an hour to drive through, all in one vista.</p>

<p>I sat down and surrendered to the moment, to the silence and penetrating solitude of this magical place. I meditated, then noticed that Abdel Zaher had climbed the mountain from another direction and was standing next to me. Yes, he had visited here many times he told me, but not recently. Here were the sticks in the cave that he had stocked several years ago to make a fire in case a heavy rain surprised his tribe while they were in this wadi. We sat there a few more minutes. “You know,” I said to Abdel Zaher, “I can feel Allah’s presence here right now.” He smiled at me, reached over and held my hand in both his leathery hands. We sat like that for a few minutes before walking quietly back down the mountain.</p>

<p><strong>Day 4: Relationships</strong></p>

<p>Despite my eagerness to learn about the desert, if I were to be asked about what made my experience so unique, my answer would have to be the Bedouin people themselves. They are a people governed by daily relationships, by common bonds used to strengthen themselves to better cope with an environment that is one of the most unforgiving on earth.</p>

<p><a href="http://blog.lesterpickerphoto.com/wp-content/uploads/2010/07/egypt-3-of-5.jpg"><img class="size-medium wp-image-408 " title="eastern desert bedouin" src="http://blog.lesterpickerphoto.com/wp-content/uploads/2010/07/egypt-3-of-5-239x300.jpg" alt="" width="167" height="210"></a></p>

<p>Throughout our trek, we would periodically pass a family of Bedouins living in the desert, usually at the base of a mountain. As a tribal leader, Abdel Zaher would stop each time to check on his people, which on several occasions ended up being one of his fifteen children or many grandchildren. Everyone would kiss and hug and greet Abdel Zaher, share stories and offer us food, usually tea and bread.</p>

<p>On our last day together, we drove for more than two hours, through wadis and around mountains to visit Abdel Zaher’s sister, Saida, whom he had not seen in weeks. Her family lived out in the open, their only shelter a rocky outcropping.</p>

<p>The joy on her face on seeing her brother was carved deeply in the wrinkles of her eyes, the only part of her face I ever saw. She and her brother hugged and kissed, then she poignantly grabbed his hand in both of hers and spent minutes kissing it and rubbing it gently on her cheeks. I was so moved by the experience, I felt tears welling in my eyes.</p>

<p>We feasted on fiteera, a flat bread Saida made from scratch, yogurt, fool, and creamed feta cheese with vegetables. We also had eggplants grilled directly in the coals of a camel dung fire. As we ate, Saida’s two young daughters played with a stack of empty film containers I gave them.</p>

<p>Driving back to Hurghada, I asked  Abdel Zaher why he didn’t run day safaris and make lots of money like some of his relatives now do. “I’ve got so many blessings,” he said. “I’m the happiest man. I don’t need more money.” We drove in silence for another hour.</p>

<p>“Abdel Zaher, what will happen to the Bedouins in five or ten years?” I asked later that afternoon, as we approached Hurghada at the end of my journey.</p>

<p>“In ten years,” he said, “there will still be a few Bedouins, but in twenty, there will be no more Bedouins living in The Great Sakhara. They have been too tempted by money. The government has done too good a job of forcing them to settle in towns.”</p>

<p>The sadness of Abdel Zaher’s comments still plague me. I shudder to think of the loss of this wonderful nomadic culture, with its emphasis on family, environment and God. Most of all, and I know how selfish this sounds, I will miss the wisdom of men like Abdel Zaher. It was the desert that initially drew me to better understand its mysteries. But, it is the people of The Great Sakhara that will bring me back later this year to better understand myself.</p>

<p>Camera and camera cleaning equipment, especially compressed air</p>

<p>Film</p>

<p>Sunblock (minimum SPF 30)</p>

<p>Wide-brimmed hat</p>

<p>Neck covering</p>

<p>High tech water purifier bottle (<a href="http:/www.magellan.com">www.magellan.com</a>)</p>

<p>Comfortable walking shoes that breathe (no boots)</p>

<p>Cushioned socks</p>

<p>Inflatable pillow</p>

<p>Notebook and pens</p>

<p>Candies, cookies or trinkets for Bedouin children</p>

<p>Sense of humor</p>

<p>Leave your cell phone at home. They don’t work in the desert, and if you think you need one here, you’re missing the point.</p>

<p>Don’t bring chocolate into the desert with you, unless you want to find out what the peanuts in a Snickers bar look like nude, without any chocolate or caramel covering, which will now be coating your suitcase.</p>

<p>Bring an interpreter with you, or hire one in Cairo or Hurghada, if you cannot speak basic Arabic.</p>

<p><strong>Essential Arabic: A Primer</strong></p>

<p>Egyptians speak Arabic and truly appreciate anyone even trying to speak their language. Although you will find some people on the street who speak English in tourist areas, you may not find bilingual people in rural areas and most certainly not among the Bedouins. Here is a selection of  words and phrases, but it’s up to you if you want to trust Arabic pronunciation to a Jewish guy from Brooklyn. However, all pronunciations have been checked with Ayman Ali, an Egyptian Arabic instructor in Baltimore. Arabic is a difficult language for Westerners, characterized by gutteral sounds, glottal stops and gender-specific words. Here I use the standard ‘kh’ designation for the gutteral ‘ch’ sound, as in Chanukah. Words in parenthesis indicate usage when addressing a woman.</p>

<p>Min fadlak (fadlik): please</p>

<p>Shukrahn: thank you</p>

<p>Kweyeiss: good; fine</p>

<p>Sabah el kheer: Hello (from morning to mid-afternoon)</p>

<p>Massah el kheer: Hello from mid-afternoon through evening</p>

<p>Aiwa:            yes</p>

<p>La’:             no</p>

<p>Anna mish fayim: I don’t understand</p>

<p>Anna assif: I’m sorry</p>

<p>El hamdulallah: Thank God</p>

<p>Mafish mooshkella: No problem</p>

<p>Izzayik inaharda: How are you today?</p>

<p>El hammam feeen, min fadlak (fadlik)?: Where is the bathroom, please? (don’t bother asking the Bedouins this question, though, as 56,000 square miles of bathroom surround you. Good luck finding a handy bush or tree.)</p>

<p>Ma’ah salemma:             goodbye</p>

<p>Sahlem alaykoom:            alternate goodbye preferred by Bedouins</p>

<p><strong>Getting there</strong>: The takeoff point for The Eastern Desert is the Red Sea resort town of Hurghada. From Cairo, the best way to get to Hurghada is by a short flight using Egypt Air. Alternately, there is train service from Cairo to Hurghada. If you are combining sightseeing with an Eastern Desert experience, it is not always easy getting from Luxor, for example, to Hurghada. EgyptAir flights are sporadic. You can make the 5-hour journey by public bus, which is inexpensive (about $5 USD each way) and is usually comfortable. Or, you can rent a private taxi, for about $50 USD each way. If you go the taxi route, you are only allowed to leave at specific times, as part of what is known as a “convoy” using the desert road, a security precaution.</p>

<p><strong>Lodging:</strong> The beaches of Hurghada are lined with major hotels, including Marriott, Movenpick, and Sheraton. My favorite is the new Hilton, which is clean and relatively inexpensive during the winter (November-March). Check the Internet for hotel specials. I secured a room with a view of the Red Sea for $79 USD per night.</p>

<p>Major chain hotels can arrange what are known as ‘desert safaris’ for one person or a group. These are 4-wheel drive, one-day excursions into the Eastern Desert, including a stop at a Bedouin ‘village’ for tea, an explanation of their lifestyle and a camel ride. Prices vary from $50 to $200 per person.</p>

<p><strong>Reading:</strong></p>

<p>If you are serious about understanding the Bedouin culture, pick up a copy of “Bedouin Life in the Egyptian Wilderness” by Joseph J. Hobbs, University of Texas Press. This well-written book is available online from Amazon and Barnes and Nobles.</p>

<p>By Lester Picker</p>

<p>[This article originally appeared in <em>The Baltimore Sun</em>. I updated it for use in 2010.]</p>

<p><a href="http://blog.lesterpickerphoto.com/wp-content/uploads/2010/07/hdg-lighthouse-1-of-11.jpg"><img class="size-medium wp-image-396" title="lighthouse, Havre de Grace, MD, USA" src="http://blog.lesterpickerphoto.com/wp-content/uploads/2010/07/hdg-lighthouse-1-of-11-200x300.jpg" alt="" width="200" height="300"></a></p>

<p>Walking the tree-lined streets of historic Havre de Grace, Maryland is like stepping back in time. Leave the hustle and bustle of the city behind, skip the mad rush of suburban shopping malls, and spend an enjoyable weekend in this quaint town, tucked into the northeastern-most corner of Harford County.</p>

<p>Ideally located at the confluence of the Susquehanna River and the Chesapeake Bay, Havre de Grace played a prominent role during the Revolutionary War. In fact, during the First Congress in 1789, Havre de Grace missed by only one vote being named the capital of the fledgling United States. Called “Harbor of Grace” for its scenic beauty, it was considered indefensible from the all-powerful British Navy. That proved prophetic, when the British later bombarded Havre de Grace during the war of 1812, destroying much of the town.</p>

<p>Today, Havre de Grace is known for its quiet streets, thirty-plus antique shops, decoy shops, historic homes, and The Promenade, an environmentally friendly boardwalk that skirts the southern end of town and links the historic Concord Point Lighthouse with the bustling Tydings Memorial Park.</p>

<p>The town hosts tourist events throughout the year, including its famed Decoy, Wildlife Art and Sportsmen’s Festival, which spans the first full weekend in May (7-9). But, unlike gentrified Annapolis, Havre de Grace is still a working town, replete with marinas, crabbers and an active stone quarry that ships its wares by barges and tugboats to places as far away as Virginia.</p>

<p>There are so many ways to enjoy Havre de Grace, you might want to plan to spend an entire weekend. Since Havre de Grace is a walking (or bicycling) town, I suggest you arrive early and park in the municipal lot on the waterfront behind MacGregor’s Restaurant and adjacent to the Tidewater Grill, two of Havre de Grace’s most distinctive restaurants. Walk west to a tucked-away shop behind St. John Street and meet horologist John Stephens, proprietor of Stephens and Stephens. Horologist? In plain English, Stephens is a watch and clockmaker, and his small, but friendly waterfront shop is a tribute to his profession.</p>

<p>Walking south and west, en route to Havre de Grace’s main drag, Washington Street, you will pass the first of the nearly three dozen antique shops the town has to offer. Stop, if you must, but be warned. Havre de Grace’s antique shops are less pricey than many other areas in the state, so you will be sorely tempted to de-fatten your wallet.</p>

<p>Havre de Grace’s Washington Street is what Main Street America was perhaps fifty years ago, lined with trees, but today serving up an eclectic mix of stores that cater to the needs of both residents and tourists. Whatever else you do, set aside some time and wander through Joseph’s Department Store, a town fixture for generations. Its linoleum tiled floors and down-home sales staff will instantly whisk you back three generations.</p>

<p>Here are some of my favorite places to eat and visit, along with a smattering of family activities. But, the fun of Havre de Grace is in exploring and finding your own favorites.</p>

<p><strong>Places to Eat:</strong></p>

<p>For fresh ground and brewed coffee, you have two choices:  Java By the Bay, next door to Joseph’s Department Store and Jana’s Java, at the intersection of St. John’s Street, Washington Street and Green Street. Sit outdoors, sip your fragrant brew, and watch the crowds walk by.</p>

<p>My absolute favorite place for lunch and fine dining is Laurrapin Grill. Chef Bruce is a master with meats and seafood. The bar features an eclectic selection of beers and wines. The back dining room has a view of the water.</p>

<p>Two Italian restaurants within a few blocks of each other serve the tiny town. La Cucina is great for informal dining, while Chiaparelli’s offers upscale fine dining.</p>

<p>For a fun and informal lunch option, try The Ritz, on St. John Street, across from Lafayette Square.</p>

<p>Oh, I almost forgot. Some of the best chocolates in Maryland are made in Havre de Grace, at Bomboy’s, a family run business on Market Street. Skip lunch, but don’t miss Bomboy’s.</p>

<p><strong>Lodging:</strong></p>

<p>Havre de Grace may not have any hotels or chain motels, but that is one of the many endearing features of this town. Instead, try The Vandiver Inn (410-939-5200) or The Spencer Silver Mansion Bed &amp; Breakfast (410-939-1097), both of them elegant and historic homes. Both offer complimentary breakfasts for guests.</p>

<p><strong>Outdoor Activities:</strong></p>

<p>In and around Havre de Grace are myriad activities for a family, ranging from mild to strenuous. The most accessible for the entire family is a leisurely stroll along The Promenade. Park in the public area at Tydings Memorial Park at the town’s southern edge, at the east end of Union Avenue. Bring binoculars and walk along the wide boardwalk, stopping at the many convenient benches to admire the view. I’ve found the best time to be near dusk, when you may be lucky enough to see a wading Great Blue Heron or other aquatic birds. The Promenade winds along the shore and culminates in a marshy area, perfect for birding, at the foot of the Concord Point Lighthouse.</p>

<p>There are two bicycle shops in town. Chesapeake Cycle and Sport is located on the corner of Washington and Congress streets. Biller’s Bikes is located on the corner of Lodge Lane, Franklin and St. John streets. Havre de Grace is bicycle friendly. Spend a pleasant few hours peddling around the many coves and quiet streets of Havre de Grace. If you’re a fishing enthusiast, nothing beats the flats, where the Susquehanna River meets the Bay, for freshwater and striped bass.</p>

<p><a href="http://blog.lesterpickerphoto.com/wp-content/uploads/2010/07/susqstpk-1-of-1.jpg"><img class="size-medium wp-image-395" title="susqstpk 1 of 1" src="http://blog.lesterpickerphoto.com/wp-content/uploads/2010/07/susqstpk-1-of-1-199x300.jpg" alt="" width="199" height="300"></a></p>

<p>Hikers and bikers would also do well to visit Susquehanna State Park (410-557-7994), due west on Route 155, a few miles outside of Havre de Grace. There you can stroll or bicycle along river paths, view historic sites, fish and birdwatch. Bald eagles have staged an incredible comeback in this area, and draw nature enthusiasts all year long, especially in winter, where they congregate just below the Conowingo Dam. A large nature viewing area is open all year.</p>

<p>Golfers have a choice of some of Maryland’s finest courses, one of which – Pete Dye designed Bulle Rock (410-939-8887) - is rated one of the top golf courses in the nation. One of the many pleasures of teeing off well north of Baltimore is less crowded tee times. Try Wetlands Golf Club (410-273-7488) and Ruggles (410-278-4794), an old-style, forgiving course located on the Aberdeen Proving Grounds.</p>

<p>Havre de Grace is also known for its more than thirty antique shops, clustered here and there along Washington Street, Union Avenue, Market Street and on many of its side streets.</p>

<p><strong>Museums and Historic Sites:</strong></p>

<p>Havre de Grace is steeped in history. The Tourism office on Pennington Street between Union Avenue and Washington Street offers a free booklet that describes a self-guided walking/driving tour of the town, starting at the Concord Point Lighthouse (410-939-9040), built in 1827.</p>

<p>Be sure to visit the Decoy Museum (410-939-3739), just yards from the lighthouse. The Decoy Museum will give you a good feel for the art of decoy carving, as well as an appreciation of the Bay’s wildlife.</p>

<p>Still in town, and again a short walk from the lighthouse, try a pleasant afternoon or evening cruise on the Skipjack Martha Lewis (800-406-0766). The 32-passenger vessel offers ninety-minute environmental cruises for the whole family. It leaves from the foot of Congress Street.</p>

<p>The Steppingstone Farm Museum (410-939-2299) is located in Susquehanna State Park, and offers demonstrations of turn-of-the-century crafts, from weaving to blacksmithing. The Museum also sponsors several festivals which are wholesome family events, set against the beautiful backdrop of the Susquehanna River.</p>

<p><strong>How To Get There:</strong></p>

<p>From Baltimore, take I-95 North to Exit 89. Take Route 155 East toward Havre de Grace and follow the signs to the center of town. Travel time from downtown Baltimore is approximately 45 minutes.</p>

<p><strong>For More Information:</strong></p>

<p>Here’s an idea for those of you wanting to increase your photography skills. Assign yourself some homework! Like in grade school penmanship lessons, I guarantee that with practice your skills will improve markedly.</p>

<p>Every so often, usually when I feel too long has gone by between photo shoots or assignments, I will give myself a photography assignment. I’ll pick a topic and force myself to shoot only on that topic for however long I feel like being out (or even inside).</p>

<p>So I thought I would regularly put an assignment in my blog and shoot it with you, discussing what it is I tried to do, as well as my take on successes and failures. However, these posts are really about you. My hope is that you’ll hand in your homework (forget the dog ate it!) and share it with me and our readers. I promise to comment if you’d like me to and I invite others to do the same.</p>

<h3>Portrait versus Landscape</h3>


<p>Okay, here’s the first assignment, what I call “Landscape-Portrait Flips.” Go outside to an environment that has strong vertical or horizontal lines and shoot the scene exactly the opposite. For example, most people shoot forest trees in portrait mode. Makes sense; tall trees = vertical shot. Instead, shoot all your vertical compositions in landscape mode. Go ahead, cut off those tree tops! The results can be unpredictable, but highly effective.</p>

<p><a href="http://blog.lesterpickerphoto.com/wp-content/uploads/2010/07/yukon_2009-09-07_1%C2%A9LesterPicker.jpg"><img class="alignleft size-medium wp-image-303" title="yukon_2009-09-07_1©LesterPicker" src="http://blog.lesterpickerphoto.com/wp-content/uploads/2010/07/yukon_2009-09-07_1%C2%A9LesterPicker-300x199.jpg" alt="" width="300" height="199"></a>Here’s what I came up with on a recent trip to the Yukon. I had a couple of days of travel ahead of me, so I had already made up my mind to focus on trees. We had stopped at a pull-out because there was a scenic lake. Several tourists were busily photographing the panoramic scene. I, too, grabbed a few shots. They seemed good on my LCD screen. But they were the same-old-same-old. I focused on my self-assignment and came up with this one. Shooting in landscape mode gave me the strong foreground elements that the sturdy tree trunks provide and I like the wisps of gold in the leaves. I wish I had more time at the scene, because I missed an opportunity to get stronger reflections in the water. I may go back into the image with post-processing and try to increase the contrast in the water reflections between the trees. I&#8217;d love to get your take on that. (<strong>Click on each image to see it full-size</strong>)</p>

<p>With this image, I liked the young saplings growing in a formerly clearcut area. In this case a horizontal shot just didn&#8217;t work for me. I liked the strong vertical lines. I also like the way the closer trees are exposed to the sun and draw your eye from right foreground to left background.</p>

<p><a href="http://blog.lesterpickerphoto.com/wp-content/uploads/2010/07/yukon2-_2009-08-27_2%C2%A9LesterPicker1.jpg"><img class="size-medium wp-image-319 alignnone" title="yukon2 _2009-08-27_2©LesterPicker" src="http://blog.lesterpickerphoto.com/wp-content/uploads/2010/07/yukon2-_2009-08-27_2%C2%A9LesterPicker1-199x300.jpg" alt="" width="199" height="300"></a></p>

<p style="text-align: center;"></p>


<p>Sunset comes late in the Yukon during the summer and early fall months. These shots were taken in September on Lake Labarge. Which one do you prefer? I think each has its merits, but I guess the vertical shot works better for me. I like the way the pier pulls my eye into the background.</p>

<p><a href="http://blog.lesterpickerphoto.com/wp-content/uploads/2010/07/yukonboat_2008-09-14_3%C2%A9LesterPicker1.jpg"><img class="size-medium wp-image-316 alignnone" title="yukonboat_2008-09-14_3©LesterPicker" src="http://blog.lesterpickerphoto.com/wp-content/uploads/2010/07/yukonboat_2008-09-14_3%C2%A9LesterPicker1-200x300.jpg" alt="" width="200" height="300"></a></p>

<p>In this final series of images, again of a formerly clearcut area, I initially shot the scene in portrait orientation, before deciding on landscape. I also converted the image to B&amp;W. I invite comments.</p>

<p>by Lester Picker</p>

<p>[This article originally appeared in <em>The Baltimore Sun Travel</em> section. Some information may be dated, so please check beforehand.]</p>

<p>The epiphany arrived for me without fanfare somewhere around midnight the second day. Here I was, on my back, hands under my head, looking up at the night sky over the British Virgin Islands. The Milky Way clouds stood out almost as clearly as the stars and galaxies around it. A shooting star punctuated the scene every few minutes.</p>

<p>Two things made this scene stand out from any other vacation. First, I was with my five closest “guy” friends, all of them similarly laid back at the moment, each of us with a Cuban cigar in hand and some of us with a glass of choice Cabernet. Second, our conversation was accented by the gentle rocking of the 51-foot catamaran we had rented, now at anchor off Virgin Gorda, a to-die-for tropical beach.</p>

<p>And therein was the epiphany. This was no mere vacation. This was the ultimate, the penultimate, the Platinum Plus, the mother of all vacations. Except that mothers, of course, would not have been allowed. Nor daughters, or wives or sisters. We even fired the woman chef who came with the boat. This was a guy vacation; 51-feet of pure testosterone.</p>

<p>Single sex vacations are gaining in popularity, as friends seek to unwind from the pressures of everyday life without adding the stresses associated with more intimate romantic attachments. Women have been traveling together for decades, sharing adventurous experiences while banding together for safety reasons. Only recently have all-male vacations begun to catch on in popularity.</p>

<p>In the planning for months, the six of us, ages 45 to 52 and friends for more than a decade, had rented the catamaran, complete with captain, from The Catamaran Company, one of the many charter companies serving the British and American Virgin Islands. Our plan included leaving all work behind (except for my trip notes, of course), limiting ourselves to one suitcase each (we figured we could jump in the water if we needed to wash off a sweaty T-shirt), and bringing good music, mostly supplied by Randy, who is an accomplished musician and jazz pianist. Bill had sent the chef a list of dietary preferences weeks before, so she could provision the galley for us.</p>

<p>When we arrived in St. Thomas, we took a taxi to the ferry, which would get us to Tortola, the hub and largest of the British Virgin Islands. While the rest of us transferred our baggage to the ferry, one our group, the owner of a multi-million dollar international business in the D.C. area who shall remain anonymous, negotiated with the driver. That is the simplest explanation I can think of for why the $24 taxi fare cost us exactly $50. But, hey, I don’t negotiate international business deals every day, so what do I know? Anyway, the point is that the taxi transfer from airport to ferry should be $4.00 per person, including baggage. Caveat emptor.</p>

<p>The ferry itself is an interesting experience, as tourists share space with locals bringing all manner of goods from St. Thomas. The ferry winds itself between islands and, on the typical sunny day with the trade winds blowing, is an enjoyable trip. The rolling hills of the islands and their deep green color, provide a visual depth to the water and white sand beaches. Going through customs is an informal affair.</p>

<p>As we disembarked on Tortola, Captain Ron was there to ferry us by dinghy directly to Stars and Stripes, previously owned by Dennis Conner, and now in the tourist trade. The first rule of the boat was ‘no shoes,” which we gladly abided by for the remainder of the week.</p>

<p>Once on board, Cathy, our supposed-to-be chef, briefed us on the provisions she had stocked for us, how to use the galley, and where to find critical items tucked here and there in cupboards and under seat cushions. Since our plans forced her to find short-term room and board on the island, we had agreed to pay her a stipend for the week. She left to spend the week hanging around local beaches with friends. Someone has to do the tough jobs.</p>

<p>So, there we were, six guys scarred and wired from months of figuratively swimming with sharks, now ready to face the real ones lurking in the crystal clear waters (we didn’t see even one). Once our gear was stowed, we immediately set sail, the perfect afternoon weather buoying our moods. Lathered with sunscreen, a must on the water under tropical skies, we hit the deck to take in the wind and salt air.</p>

<p>By sunset, we reached Jost Van Dyke, a small island west of Tortola with remote white sand beaches, where the spectacular red sunset set the tone for the evening. Working together, our group somehow pulled together a dinner of diced tuna steaks with shrimp and scallops, sautéed with garlic and herbs, over a bed of wild rice. Fresh multi-grain bread, steamed asparagus and a choice of two elegant wines rounded out the main course.</p>

<p>On deck, Randi, an amateur astronomer, briefed us on the night sky, which appeared so close and bright we all felt suitably humbled. As the boat gently rocked to the rhythm of the waves, we divided the cabins. Four of us slept inside, and two of us slept under an awning on deck, the gentle, cool breezes lulling us to sleep in an instant.</p>

<p>The next morning dawned under a bright sun, as three of us started the day with a morning dip off the back of the boat - au natural. A pot of wine-dark coffee and a breakfast of eggs, bread and cereals revved up our engines. By nine, we were on the water, singly or in groups, engaged in whatever water pursuits were available. Joel, a fanatical wind surfer, gave Randi and me lessons. Bill tried his hand (and feet, and at times his entire body) water-skiing. Jay and John kayaked the island, exploring its marine caves and beaches.</p>

<p>After a light lunch, we spent the better part of the afternoon loafing, catching a nap, reading, or just talking one on one, in what turned out to be a daily pattern. At one point, I lay on the netting that separates the catamaran hulls as we skimmed the surface at eight knots. Looking down, I could see the bottom some thirty feet down, and occasional fish scurrying by. Above, billowing clouds dotted the skies. The thought occurred to me that perhaps life does get better as you get older. Here I was surrounded by friends I love, and with whom I could let down my guard. Life was definitely good.</p>

<p>After dinner of grilled salmon steaks, we settled down for an evening of high stakes poker, each of us anteing up five dollars for chips. By the time 11 PM rolled around, we were definitely ready for bed.</p>

<p>Captain Ron, 32-years old and an experienced sailor, was as easygoing as a person could be. He accommodated all our destination and activity requests, even making suggestions once he got to know us better.</p>

<p>On our third day, it occurred to us that we hadn’t touched land at all. We sailed to the Dogs, a series of rocky islands east of Tortola, where we anchored and spent a wondrous morning snorkeling in and around the reefs. At West Dog we found a cave carved into the rocks and our entire group snorkeled in and out. Long shafts of sunlight flickered down to the depths of the cave and colorful tropical fish darted in and out, their iridescent colors flashing on and off as they made their appearances.</p>

<p>We were so taken by the experience, at one point we all swam as far as we could into a particularly long cave and then spontaneously gathered in a circle in the water and let out a long holler. Definitely a guy thing.</p>

<p><a href="http://blog.lesterpickerphoto.com/wp-content/uploads/2010/07/BVI-virgin-gorda_2008-08-27_5%C2%A9LesterPicker.jpg"><img class="size-medium wp-image-341" title="Virgin Gorda, Tortola, BVI" src="http://blog.lesterpickerphoto.com/wp-content/uploads/2010/07/BVI-virgin-gorda_2008-08-27_5%C2%A9LesterPicker-199x300.jpg" alt="" width="199" height="300"></a></p>

<p>That afternoon we made a short stop for supplies at the Virgin Gorda Yacht Harbour, our first landfall. The Yacht Harbour caters to the boating community, with a full-services marina, marine supply store, a dive shop, a quaint bar and restaurant, and a few tourist shops. Virgin Gorda itself is an 8.5 square mile, rambling island due east of Tortola, boasting towns, long stretches of white sand beaches and, for hikers and nature lovers, Gorda Peak National Park. The Park is a favorite for birders, with chances good for spotting some of the more than 200 species of Virgin Island birds. Christopher Columbus named it The Fat Virgin because of its unusual shape; fat in the middle with elongated spurs of land running east and west.</p>

<p>On the fourth day, we did a little snorkeling from the boat in the morning, then sailed for the rest of the day, listening to great jazz en route, talking and relaxing on the nets between the hulls. We were headed for the reefs of Anegada, where we planned to do some heavy snorkeling the following day.</p>

<p>Anegada is a quaint island – actually a coral atoll- only eleven miles long, very narrow, and flat as a pancake, which caters to windsurfers and divers. It offers tourists simple homelike cottages and, for the more adventurous two campgrounds. For dinner, we feasted on lobster at Neptune’s Treasure, a quirky, come-as-you-are seafood restaurant on the south side of the island. The restaurant even catered to those of our group who were vegetarian, with heaping plates of lightly steamed vegetables, potatoes and angel hair pasta. Due to the light Labor Day crowds, the restaurant was like a scene from Casablanca, with people milling about, some smoking, and lots of laughing.</p>

<p>In a trip of highlights, the next major moment came the following day, when we spent a memorable four hours snorkeling the reefs off Loblolly Beach on the windward side of Anegada. We waded into the warm water from the beach, where the reefs literally reach out to just 18 inches below the surface. Just snorkeling you can swim among schools of fish and spend hours taking in the beauty of the varied coral formations. If you are a SCUBA enthusiast, the wrecks which dot the coral reefs are a major attraction for both fish and divers. Gear is available for modest rental fees from one of many shops that dot the islands. Dive boat charters, including night dives, are available for under $100 for a two-tank trip. Basic and advanced instruction is also available. Boats can accommodate families with one diver and the rest snorkelers or observers.</p>

<p>That afternoon, our final one on board the Stars and Stripes, we sailed back to Tortola, Spanish for Turtle Dove, gorging ourselves on fresh island fruits, especially sweet, ripe pineapples, thoughtfully and amply stocked by our ex-chef. Since the boat boasts a charcoal grill on the rear deck, we grilled huge steaks of Mahi-Mahi, with angel hair pasta and homemade sauce.</p>

<p>After dark, we sat around comparing highlights of the trip, before heading into Cane Garden Bay on the northwest side of Tortola to taste some local rum along the many bars that line the beaches. A delightful steel calypso band serenaded the guests to a lively island beat. After living on a boat for five days, we all felt as if the bar itself was swaying.</p>

<p>On our last morning, we woke early, packed our gear and sailed to the south side of the island to pick up our ferry back to St. Thomas. Leaving Stars and Stripes wasn’t easy, after an idyllic vacation of sun, sea and sail. But, parting was made easier by the transition on St. Thomas, with its fine restaurants, pretty side alleys and cobblestone streets, packed with stores catering to the tourist trade. Tiny cafes serving strong Jamaican coffee are interspersed with boutiques selling handmade clothing and jewelry. If you are going to the British Virgin Islands, plan to spend at least half a day touring St. Thomas, its American cousin.</p>

<p><strong>Sidebar</strong></p>

<p>Virgin Island charter boats typically are rented to couples either without captain (known as a bare boat charter) or with. Increasingly, though, groups of all men or women friends will splurge. However, if you’re in a serious relationship with a member of the opposite sex, figure on the trip costing double. Your relationship will never survive unless your significant other gets his or her chance to show off their ideal vacation pictures. Sort of an adult version of I’ll show you mine if you show me yours.</p>

<p>Boats come equipped with everything for a perfect vacation on the water, from windsurfers to water-skis. The boat is also equipped with a VCR, a video library, stereo with CD player, and many other comforts of home. Charter companies will also entertain reasonable requests for special items or activities, such as SCUBA classes or special dietary preferences. Since charter boats cater to the business crowd, they all have marine mobile telephones on board.</p>

<p>The Catamaran Company (1-800-262-0308: http://<a href="http://www.catamaranco.com/">www.catamaranco.com</a>/) offers bare boats ranging from 37 to 48 feet, each with three to 5 cabins. Crewed boats range from 48-65 feet. Appointments are luxurious (cherry wood interiors, showers in each cabin, electric heads) and every watery whim one could want is provided in the fee. Since our charter was off-season and only five full days, each of us ended up paying only $1,400.</p>

<p>by Lester Picker</p>

<p>[This article originally appeared in The Baltimore Sun Travel section. Some information may be dated, so always check beforehand.]</p>

<p><a href="http://blog.lesterpickerphoto.com/wp-content/uploads/2010/07/sun-city-SA_2006-10-29_7%C2%A9LesterPicker.jpg"><img class="size-medium wp-image-346" title="sun city, SA_2006-10-29_7©LesterPicker" src="http://blog.lesterpickerphoto.com/wp-content/uploads/2010/07/sun-city-SA_2006-10-29_7%C2%A9LesterPicker-204x300.jpg" alt="" width="204" height="300"></a></p>

<p>Huddling against the cold in the June pre-dawn darkness in Pilanesberg National Park, South Africa, nothing could have prepared me for the sights and sounds that were ever so slowly, magically inching their way over the horizon.</p>

<p>As our hot air balloon filled in noisy bursts, we could see the faint outline of a herd of wildebeests grazing unperturbed all around us. Our guide, Andrew, kept us herded together, too, a high-powered rifle at his side. A pair of lions was seen the day before hunting in this section of the park and he was taking no chances.</p>

<p>A few minutes later we were off. The huge balloon rose in tandem with the sun, the horizon painted in muted shades of red and orange, as if half a world away the earth was on fire. With the daylight, birds took to the air around and below us, baboons chattered, and the joyous noises of Africa’s diverse wildlife alternated with the man-made blasts of propane keeping us aloft.</p>

<p>For the next two hours we hovered over the huge game preserve, which sits inside an extinct volcanic alkaline crater, one of only three in the world. As the sun heated the land, giving us added buoyancy, we watched rhinoceros feed on knee-high grasses, and elephants tug leaves from trees with their trunks. Hippopotamuses rested one on top of another in the shallow lakes, and brown and white springboks grazed at the ecotone between grassland and brush. Descending over a lake, a lone sacred ibis waded patiently at the edge of a lake hunting for fish. Most amazing of all was that throughout the balloon ride we were never out of view of the spires of The Palace of the Lost City at Sun City, South Africa, the continent’s premier family resort.</p>

<p>Describing Sun City is a challenge. On the surface it is a glitzy $300 million dollar complex of four resorts, including the upscale Palace of the Lost City, the more moderate Cascades, the affordable Sun City Hotel and the family-friendly Cabanas. Strategically placed within its currently developed 150 acres are two Gary Player designed, 18-hole golf courses, one of them with the now infamous 40-crocodile water hazard on the 13th hole. There is also an entertainment complex which houses a 6,000-seat theater featuring world-class entertainers, along with two casinos, cinemas showing first-run attractions, retail shopping, restaurants, convention facilities and a world-class video arcade for the kids. Just a short walk from the entertainment complex is Waterworld, boasting machines generating waves you can surf on and a series of water slides that include a three-story monster you’re guaranteed to never forget.  After you discover the dozens of gourmet restaurants and fast-food facilities in Sun City, you’ll need to make use of its state-of-the-art fitness facility.</p>

<p>The dreamchild of the controversial entrepreneur Sol Kerzner, the founder of Sun International Resorts, Sun City is without a doubt his crowning achievement, a destination so well conceived, and even more brilliantly executed, I found myself time and again marveling at its sheer magnificence. Dig below your initial impressions, and you will find a level of detail and attention to service that is remarkable.</p>

<p>Sun City is located two hours northwest of Johannesburg, in South Africa’s North West Province. The resort is partially surrounded by Pilanesberg National Park, a 14,000 acre national preserve accessible by four wheel drive vehicles driven by trained guides and naturalists. Sun City is an idyllic destination for families seeking a once-in-a-lifetime adventure. In fact, short of Disney World, I can’t imagine a place more attuned to the needs of families.</p>

<p><a href="http://blog.lesterpickerphoto.com/wp-content/uploads/2010/07/sun-city-SA_2006-10-29_5%C2%A9LesterPicker.jpg"><img class="alignleft size-medium wp-image-348" title="sun city, SA_2006-10-29_5©LesterPicker" src="http://blog.lesterpickerphoto.com/wp-content/uploads/2010/07/sun-city-SA_2006-10-29_5%C2%A9LesterPicker-300x202.jpg" alt="" width="300" height="202"></a>Arriving at The Palace of the Lost City after a 14-hour flight and a two-hour drive from Johannesburg, I expected to have little patience for its pretensions, which include a 61-acre man-made tropical rain forest surrounding the $175 million Palace. Instead, I was stunned by its immaculately manicured grounds, the fine arts sculptures - all by South African artists - which adorn its many nooks and crannies, and the management’s unswerving commitment to environmentally friendly practices. The forest’s 1.6 million plants, and both golf courses, are watered by an automated, recycled water system, bolstered by composted soil from Sun City’s operations. Shades of Jurassic Park, Kerzner even erected an electric fence, to the tune of $3 million, to protect guests from the Pilanesberg wildlife - and vice versa as a park ranger pointedly mentioned, with a wink.</p>

<p>But, it is in the little touches that Sun City excels, from the high quality service throughout the resort, to the hand-carved timber doors and beds that lavishly decorate each of the 338 rooms in The Palace, or the luxurious robes that are meticulously arranged on your bed every night, cuddling a basket of assorted Godiva chocolates. Entering The Palace’s lobby, one is immediately struck by Kerzner’s commitment to excellence. Italian marble floors surround 300,000 hand-painted mosaic tiles in the form of native South African wildlife. The vaulted, domed ceiling in the lobby features a hand-painted fresco of South African natural scenes. Italian crystal chandeliers grace the elegant open-style Crystal Court restaurant, just off the lobby.</p>

<p><a href="http://blog.lesterpickerphoto.com/wp-content/uploads/2010/07/sun-city-SA_2006-10-29_6%C2%A9LesterPicker.jpg"><img class="alignright size-medium wp-image-349" title="sun city, SA_2006-10-29_6©LesterPicker" src="http://blog.lesterpickerphoto.com/wp-content/uploads/2010/07/sun-city-SA_2006-10-29_6%C2%A9LesterPicker-201x300.jpg" alt="" width="201" height="300"></a>At night, The Palace is lit by the glow of hundreds of natural gas torches, which highlight it’s stone and precast cement architecture and lend an absolutely magical and mysterious aura. In the center of one of its outdoor courtyards stands a life-size bronze statue of the legendary Shawu, an enormous bull elephant that is an integral part of South Africa’s wild heritage. Five-star restaurants and elegant bars are sprinkled throughout the cavernous Palace.</p>

<p>The Palace’s water attractions place it in a category of one, arguably surpassed only by another Sun International property, Atlantis in the Bahamas, although that property has an entirely different ambiance. Everywhere guests go at the Palace, they are greeted by waterfalls, shallow pools with wild wading birds, swimming pools, and the ever popular Valley of the Waves, which generates mechanical waves more active guests can surf on. The man-made tropical forest even has babbling brooks winding through its canopied structure.</p>

<p>Despite its many attractions, The Palace’s ambiance is restrained, quiet and elegant. If gambling is in your plans, you’ll have to take the complimentary shuttle bus or take a leisurely walk to the casinos.</p>

<p>If The Palace is too rich for your taste, sample any of the other three Sun City hotels on the property, all of which border a man-made lake that offers everything from boating to parasailing, water-skiing to windsurfing. Central to the hotels is a state-of-the-art child care facility, called Camp Kwena, which is the local Tswana tribe name for crocodile. But not to worry. The only animals the children will see at Camp Kwena are contained in a wonderful petting zoo that campers access daily with their counselors. A few steps from the zoo there is a marvelous aviary, where rare African birds flit from branch to branch. There are also huge play forts and castles, trampolines and even an electric car track for younger campers, complete with stop signs and crosswalks. All staff are trained and licensed and offer a wide range of activities for children of all ages. Parents may drop off children in the morning and pick them up in the evening. Babysitting is available in the evenings.</p>

<p>Next in line in order of palatial amenities is the 242-room Cascades Hotel, the smallest in Sun City, featuring a theme of cascading water and lush tropical gardens, both inside and out. Sit in the outdoor portion of the Peninsula restaurant and enjoy views of the gardens, lake and the Gary Player Golf Course. The family will be entertained by peacocks walking free, strutting their stuff among the tables, or watch flamingoes wading in the lake. Send the kids out to play in the garden while waiting for your meal, and you can sip drinks to the refreshing sounds of streams and waterfalls that meander through the restaurant area.</p>

<p>The gardens, which draw guests from the other three hotels, are constantly being transformed based on people’s preferences and the natural ecology of South Africa. Gardeners record guests preferred walkways getting from the Cascades to other attractions, then build landscaped, pebbled garden paths to conform. You can wander the vividly colorful azalea gardens, or grab a peaceful nap in one of the many hammocks that dot a circle of fig trees. In some areas, vegetation has been intentionally thinned to provide birders with unobstructed views of songbirds that flitter among the hanging orchids.</p>

<p>Rooms at the Cascades are tastefully appointed, much more in line with an upscale American hotel than is true in the opulent Palace. True to form, the management brought in one of the world’s top hotel décor designers, Trisha Wilson of Dallas, to carry the garden theme into each and every room. Even the bedspreads are quilted with tropical flowers and foliage.</p>

<p>If your blood runs hot and you crave excitement, try the even more affordable Sun City Hotel, with its cavernous gambling casino and nonstop night life. The Sun City Hotel is connected to the Entertainment Center, with its first-run movie theater and video arcade, providing non-stop entertainment for every family member. Be careful, though. The frenetic pace may simply be too over-stimulating for very young children.</p>

<p>The Entertainment Center includes several international fast-food restaurants, so even if your family lodges in one of the other hotels in Sun City, missing older children are sure to be found here. There is a range of restaurants, from French cuisine to Moroccan, with the Raffles Supper Club offering dinner and dancing. If you can, enjoy breakfast on the Terrace, with its views of the surrounding hills of Pilanesberg.</p>

<p>Walk out of the back door of the Sun City Hotel and you are on the Bridge of Time, which blasts guests with a simulated volcano every thirty minutes. The scene draws scads of kids to its regular eruptions, with the bridge itself shaking convincingly. From there, it’s just a stone’s throw to the water attractions at The Valley of the Waves.</p>

<p>A bargain even by American standards, the Cabanas, the fourth lodging property, offers the same idyllic African scenery, and full access to Sun City’s casinos and amenities, as that of its more luxurious sisters. Family-style room are clean, but modestly furnished in what approaches motel-style accommodations. However, the setting for families is ideal, with Camp Kwena no more than a few hundred feet away, and a panoramic view of the lake thrown in for good measure. A short walk away are tennis and squash courts, ten pin bowling, and volley ball, as well as a fully equipped health spa A terrace lounge, as well as two restaurants, round out the amenities offered at the Cabanas. Special package offers make the Cabanas an ideal way to visit South Africa, its wonderful people and wildlife, without breaking the bank.</p>

<p>Cape Town deservedly draws the bulk of South African tourists. However, travelers there would be well advised to place Sun City on their itineraries. One of the very fortunate distractions on the long flight to South Africa is the chance to fly South African Airways, a top-rated airline with excellent food and service, including a list of very fine South African wines.</p>

<p><strong>Sun City Direct Line</strong>: (800) 990-8299.</p>

<p><strong>South African Airways</strong>: (800) 722-9675.</p>

		  <div class="entry-content"><p>The Galapagos: Enchanted Islands</p>

<p>by Lester Picker</p>

<p>[This article originally appeared in <em>The Baltimore Sun </em>Travel section. Some information may be dated, so always check beforehand.]</p>

<p>Magical is the most overused word when writing about the Galapagos, those magical islands off the coast of Ecuador. Oops! Sorry, but there really is something about these islands that gets under your skin. One visit and you’re hooked. Two visits morphs you into a passionate advocate.</p>

<p>On my last visit I tried to figure out just what is so alluring about the Galapagos. Compared to the lush majesty of the Hawaiian Islands they rank a distant second. They can’t boast four-diamond restaurants or five-star hotels and there is not a shopping mega-mall or multiplex anywhere.</p>

<p><a href="http://blog.lesterpickerphoto.com/wp-content/uploads/2010/07/galapagos_2007-12-12_10%C2%A9LesterPicker.jpg"><img class="alignleft size-medium wp-image-353" title="galapagos_2007-12-12_10©LesterPicker" src="http://blog.lesterpickerphoto.com/wp-content/uploads/2010/07/galapagos_2007-12-12_10%C2%A9LesterPicker-300x200.jpg" alt="" width="300" height="200"></a>What does make them so special is that they are situated directly on the Pacific equator. Deep-ocean currents well up all around them, bringing tons of nutrients to support plankton, fish, sea lions, humpback whales, sea birds, and iguanas. Unfortunately, the very wildlife that makes the Galapagos so attractive may be its undoing. Today more than 148,000 visitors flock to the islands, an increase of more than 87,000 since 2000 alone.</p>

<p>This influx of tourists has been responsible for a corresponding spike in residents, both legal and illegal, that cater to the tourist trade.  The environmental stresses associated with that level of human activity – think housing, roads, pollution - has brought this fragile ecosystem to imminent crisis, with UNESCO recently adding the archipelago to its danger list. When locally owned and run boats handled all tourism, there were fewer problems. But the advent of mega-ships, each unloading hundreds of tourists at a time has exacerbated the environmental damage. A side effect of the overpopulation is that marine stocks are being over-fished, prompting restrictive government regulations. In February, 2008, 53 sea lions were slaughtered, most likely by local fishermen upset with those new measures.</p>

<p><a href="http://blog.lesterpickerphoto.com/wp-content/uploads/2010/07/galapagos_2006-11-14_11%C2%A9LesterPicker.jpg"><img class="size-medium wp-image-354" title="marine iguanas, Galapagos" src="http://blog.lesterpickerphoto.com/wp-content/uploads/2010/07/galapagos_2006-11-14_11%C2%A9LesterPicker-300x176.jpg" alt="" width="300" height="176"></a></p>

<p>Concerns over the fate of the Galapagos have prompted the tourism industry to band together with Galapagos National Park administrators and scientists to develop sustainable eco-tourism standards. It is now possible to be an eco-conscious Galapagos tourist.</p>

<p>First, and most importantly, choose a locally owned and operated smaller boat, one that holds 10-30 tourists, with 20 being the ideal number. They have far less impact on the environment and can place you on island locations that the larger ships simply cannot access.</p>

<p>Probably the oldest company serving the Galapagos is the venerable Metropolitan Touring (www.metropolitan-touring.com). Metropolitan operates a huge recycling center that converts all of its plastic waste to pavers that are used in street construction in Puerto Aroyo, the main port of the Galapagos. They also recycle paper and donate money for environmental conservation through their private foundation.</p>

<p>The most eco-conscious tour company is locally-owned-and-operated Ecoventura (www.ecoventura.com), operating a fleet of three boats that each accommodates 20 people. The accommodations are rustic and the food good and plentiful, not gourmet, but the guides are terrific and you will always be in an excursion group of no more than ten, which in itself minimizes the effect on wildlife. Ecoventura has been cited repeatedly for its forward-thinking environmental agenda that includes a ten-point program to reduce its environmental impact. In fact, Ecoventura recently entered into a partnership with the World Wildlife Fund that places it on the forefront of environmental stewardship.</p>

<p><a href="http://blog.lesterpickerphoto.com/wp-content/uploads/2010/07/galapagos_2007-12-14_8%C2%A9LesterPicker.jpg"><img class="size-medium wp-image-356" title="galapagos_2007-12-14_8©LesterPicker" src="http://blog.lesterpickerphoto.com/wp-content/uploads/2010/07/galapagos_2007-12-14_8%C2%A9LesterPicker-300x200.jpg" alt="" width="300" height="200"></a></p>

<p>These ecological concerns, coupled with more stringent protective regulations, make it incumbent on the tourist to be sure they get what they expect during their visit. For example, as of 2008 the number of tour boats has been capped at 85. But, certain islands or sites are available ONLY to boats carrying 20 or fewer passengers. In addition, there are regulations pending that may limit each tour boat to a prescribed two-week rotation, so that environmental impact can be closely monitored. The best advice is to read up on the Galapagos and make a wildlife wish list, then correspond with your operator to be sure you will see those animals before putting down a deposit. But act fast, because with the number of boats capped so are the number of visitors and reservations are often made a year or more in advance.</p>

<p>Since the Galapagos archipelago is a living laboratory, regulations change, although usually with some warning. For example, Fernandina Island is currently off limits to snorkeling due to the stresses placed on sea turtles and other wildlife. Parts of Isabella Island are off limits until the introduced goat problem is solved and endemic plants recover. That might be several years.</p>

<p>There is one non-ecological issue that travelers to the Galapagos should be aware of. Recently, tour operators have become increasingly concerned about liability issues</p>

<p>As a result, some are requiring tourists to sign what could only be considered onerous release forms. The insane thing is that these are not mailed in advance. The first you will see of it is when you land in the Galapagos, just minutes before boarding your boat. I have seen some pretty irate tourists facing a draconian choice of signing or going home.  My recommendation is that you demand to see any releases before putting down your deposit.</p>

<p>Once you visit the Galapagos, you will understand why I say that any hassles you might have getting there fade quickly into background noise. You’ll carry the pungent smell of sea lions in your memory bank for a lifetime. Ditto the sights of a baby albatross spreading its wings, or hundreds of marine iguanas basking in the sun, or the sounds and sites of thousands of frigate birds nesting. Oh, did I say that these islands are just magical?</p>

<p><a href="http://blog.lesterpickerphoto.com/wp-content/uploads/2010/07/galapagos_2007-12-13_9%C2%A9LesterPicker.jpg"><img class="size-medium wp-image-358" title="Giant Tortoise, Galapagos" src="http://blog.lesterpickerphoto.com/wp-content/uploads/2010/07/galapagos_2007-12-13_9%C2%A9LesterPicker-300x200.jpg" alt="" width="300" height="200"></a></p>

<p><strong>Ten Things to Know Before You Go</strong></p>

<ol>
<li>The      Galapagos archipelago consist of 19 islands, directly on the equator, some      650 miles off the coast of Ecuador, covering an area of nearly 20,000      square miles of ocean.</li>
    <li>Ecuador      uses the American dollar as its currency, making it an easy travel country      for Americans. And, speaking of currency (well, sort of), Ecuador uses      standard 110 volt current, the same as the U.S.A.</li>
    <li>Be      sure every question you have about your itinerary and ship is answered      before you pay your deposit. Know which wildlife you want to see and which      islands you want to visit and be certain that your tour operator will      accommodate those wish lists on your specified dates.</li>
    <li>Be      aware that every plane is sprayed with 2% D-Phenothin (an insecticide)      before landing in the Galapagos. That’s good for the Galapagos wildlife,      not so good for you. Bring along a bandana, disposable breathing mask or      breathing filter to wear when spraying begins.</li>
    <li>Guides      are licensed by the Galapagos National Park in a rigorous process. They      are experts in every sense of the word and usually good with people.      However, remember that their first priority is to protect the fragile      ecology of the islands. Therefore always stay with your group, follow      directions carefully and do not wander off prescribed paths. Be forewarned      that paths are often slippery, very rocky and are often studded with      razor-sharp lava.</li>
    <li>You      will never get closer to exotic wildlife than you will in the Galapagos.      However, you are not allowed to touch any of the wildlife there. By      abiding by these regulations you will reduce stress and the transmission      of disease to wildlife.</li>
    <li>Delicate      as it is to mention, one of the biggest problems reported by Galapagos      guides are bratty children whose parents cannot bear to tell them “no.” I      have seen unruly children chasing nesting albatrosses and kicking      defenseless marine iguanas. Look at your impending Galapagos excursion as      an unprecedented opportunity to learn to set limits for your children. If      your kids are already perfect, please accept my apologies.</li>
    <li>Most      Galapagos tour companies will arrange side trips to the Amazon and to the      Otavalo highlands region. Take advantage of these once-in-a-lifetime      experiences. I would recommend Sacha Lodge in the Amazon (<a href="http://www.sachalodge.com">www.sachalodge.com</a>). For an      over-the-top, upscale, and moderately priced experience in the indigenous      Otavalo region, attractive to shoppers as well as hikers, try the      five-star La Mirage Garden Hotel &amp; Spa, which is a Relais &amp;      Chateaux property in Cotacachi-Imbabura (<a href="http://www.mirage.com.ec">www.mirage.com.ec</a>)      .</li>
    <li>Bring      a good camera and at least twice as many memory cards as you think you      will use.</li>
    <li>Take      advantage of snorkeling opportunities, even if you are a timid swimmer.      Sea lions dart around you, sea turtles glide effortlessly below you, and      marine iguanas will swim right by you en route to their seaweed grazing      beds down deep. And that’s in addition to schools of colorful fish and      corals.  Magical, really!</li>

		  <div class="entry-content"><p><strong>Winter Fun in Boulder, Colorado</strong></p>

<p>by Lester Picker</p>

<p>[This article originally appeared in <em>Better Homes &amp; Gardens. </em>Some material may be dated. Please check beforehand.]</p>

<p><em>“This valley is so beautiful that people seeing it will never be happy anywhere else and will always return.”</em></p>

<ul>
<li>Arapaho Chief Niwot’s ‘curse’</li>
</ul>


<p>Sitting at the foot of Colorado’s imposing Front Range mountains, the scenery around Boulder is nothing less than spectacular.  Streets radiate from the town center and quickly turn into valleys, gorges and peaks of incredible beauty.  From any point in town you can see the Flatiron Mountains dominating the scenery with their imposing presence.</p>

<p>Despite its reputation as a training ground for Olympic hopefuls, Boulder is a family mecca for winter recreation. With more than 300 sunny days a year, mild winter temperatures, and a city psyche geared toward active pursuits, Boulder is the perfect winter get-away destination.</p>

<p><strong><em>Skiing</em></strong></p>

<p>Whether your preference is cross-country, downhill or snowboarding, Boulder has ten ski resorts within a two drive. Thirty minutes from downtown is the Eldora Mountain resort, boasting 43 trails for beginners through advanced, and a complete child care facility for newborns to pre-teens. Views of the Continental Divide from Eldora Mountain are magical. Snowboarders are welcome.</p>

<p>Eldora’s Nordic Center is one of the best in Colorado, with 45 kilometers of cross-country trails, instruction, rentals, ladies days, and even a mountain cabin which is available for rental.</p>

<p><strong><em>Snowshoeing and Ice-skating</em></strong></p>

<p>For a special family treat, take a scenic 20-mile drive through mountain passes and gorges, to Gold Lake Mountain Resort in the nearby old mining town of Ward. Perched on the shores of pristine Gold Lake, the resort is an environmentally friendly facility with spectacular views and every amenity possible.  Enjoy ice-skating on the lake, or hiking one of the many snowshoeing trails.  Equipment rentals are free for guests.</p>

<p>If you’re a cross-country enthusiast, take off from Gold Lake Mountain Resort and enjoy the Brainard Lake trails, just across the road. At 11,000 feet, the trails weave through the forest and along the shore, with opportunities to stop at cabins run by the Colorado Mountain Club for coffee and hot chocolate.  Then, be sure to come back and dine at Gold Lake’s gourmet restaurant, Alice’s.  After dinner, relax in their indoor or outdoor hot tubs, or indulge in a full-body massage offered by professional masseuses.</p>

<p>In Boulder itself, ice-skating and sledding are available in Scott Carpenter Park.</p>

<p><strong><em>Biking, Hiking and Horseback Riding</em></strong></p>

<p>The Boulder Creek Trail is one of the finest examples of urban recreation parks in the country.  Meandering for eleven miles, the trail is plowed during winter to allow for family biking, running or just plain ambling.  Starting in town, the creek winds through breathtaking mountain passes and gorges.  True to the Boulder spirit, the trail is dotted with sculptures and roadway underpasses are painted with murals by local artists.  Bicycle rentals are available at many locations in town.</p>

<p>Since sixty-degree winter days are common, why not plan a session of horseback riding through pastures and fields with open vistas of Boulder’s Front Range?  Boulder ranches are family-friendly.  Dress warmly and stash a jug of hot chocolate in the saddlebags.</p>

<p><strong><em>Rainy Day Activities</em></strong></p>

<p>Whether its rain or moody children, taking an off-day in Boulder can be a wonderful opportunity to recharge the family batteries.  Try some of these out-of-the-ordinary activities.</p>

<p>The <strong>Butterfly Pavilion and Insect Center</strong> is located midway between Boulder and Denver. It is a first-class science attraction, where the family can seek shelter from rain or cold amidst a tropical rain forest where butterflies flutter everywhere.  Children will delight when they land on their hands or heads.</p>

<p>Boulder is also the home to <strong>Celestial Seasonings Tea company</strong>, where a pleasant morning or afternoon can be spent touring the factory, sampling dozens of different teas, and viewing art exhibits. But, don’t miss the Mint Room, where natural mints for teas are stored.  It’s guaranteed to be an unforgettable experience.</p>

<p>And, don’t forget the <strong>Boulder Public Library</strong> when planning the day’s events.  With a full slate of films, lectures, discussion groups, children’s storytime, concerts and young adult activities, the library is a family’s best friend.  Best of all, the main library hosts a gift shop and espresso bar in an inviting open architecture that soothes the soul.</p>

<p><strong><em>Lodging</em></strong></p>

<p>For a carefree vacation, try the Gold Lake Mountain Resort, where the entire family will be alternately energized and pampered.  Every winter activity, from sledding and ice-skating to cross-country skiing and snowshoeing are available on the property.  Each cabin is decorated in a funky, one-of-a-kind style.</p>

<p>In Boulder itself, try the Alps Boulder Canyon Inn, with its beautifully appointed Victorian rooms, each with a fireplace. The charming Inn, a former stagecoach stop and bordello, boasts walk-in fireplaces and lounge areas downstairs.</p>

<p>The Boulderado Hotel is Boulder’s most famous resting place, having hosted the likes of Teddy Roosevelt, Douglas Fairbanks, Bat Masterson, Robert Frost and Helen Keller.  Its old West charm is complemented by a modern wing which blends comfortably into its architecture.</p>

<p>by Lester Picker</p>

<p><em>[Please note: This article originally appeared in a consumer magazine. Information in this article may be dated. Always check before making reservations or traveling.]</em></p>

<p><strong>Boulder</strong></p>

<h2>The Alps Boulder Canyon Inn</h2>


<p>From the quaint painted porch of <em>The Alps Boulder Canyon Inn</em>, comfortably nestled in the midst of majestic Boulder Canyon in Colorado’s scenic Front Range mountains, one can be excused for smiling at Chief Niwot’s ‘curse.’ Sipping fresh-squeezed lemonade, prepared each quiet summer’s afternoon by innkeepers Jeanine and John Vanderhart, while resting peacefully on cushioned white wicker furniture, the ambience is nothing less than spectacular. You look across the canyon at the shear wall of the mountain, with its tall pine trees and exposed rock surfaces. As the sun sets, the magical sounds of rushing Boulder creek fill the night air.</p>

<p>Unlike their East-coast cousins, western Inns often have the luxury of space – lots if it. The Alps Boulder Canyon Inn is no exception, with its grand entranceway and vaulted foyer which showcases its walk-through stone fireplace, trophy elk head mounted on the second floor ceiling and huge bear rug draped over the third floor interior balcony.</p>

<p>The Alps’ twelve meticulously appointed guest rooms belie its shaded past. Once upon a time it was a stagecoach stop and bordello, catering to the hard-rock, and often hard-luck miners on their way to points north. But, four years ago, the Vanderharts began lovingly restoring the Inn, refining the style of the great lodges and camps of the Northwoods to an art form.</p>

<p>John Vanderhart has labored lovingly doing the stonework on the property, laying out meandering native flagstone pathways and delightful water gardens with outdoor tables so guests can enjoy the plantings with their morning coffee. Jeanine has delighted in refurbishing all guest rooms with Victorian furnishings and fireplaces. Each of the spacious rooms features a sitting area and a private bath with either a claw foot tub or double Jacuzzi tub and shower. Family heirlooms and period antiques welcome guests.</p>

<p>Breakfasts, featuring home-made Belgian waffles, are personally served by Jeanine and her staff in the huge dining room, decorated with rustic wood furniture. The mossrock fireplace dominates the room, adding a warmth during chill summer evenings or cold winter days. SK and Sid, mother and son Persian cats, often bask in front of the fireplace on their namesake Persian rugs, purring contentedly as guests pet them. Guests, snug in the warmly invitingly sofa or armchairs, have been known to purr contentedly over a glass of port, too.</p>

<p>The Alps Boulder Canyon Inn, 38619 Boulder Canyon Drive, Boulder, CO 80302; 800/414-ALPS. Twelve units, all w/private baths. Full gourmet American and buffet breakfasts, afternoon tea and evening desserts included. Cancellation policy. No smoking, no pets. All major credit cards.</p>

<h2>Earl House</h2>


<p>Two miles down Canyon Drive, in downtown Boulder, the streets that radiate from the town center quickly turn into valleys, gorges and peaks of incredible beauty. From nearly any point in town you can see the Flatiron Mountains dominating the scenery with their imposing presence. And, in the midst of the art, culture and beauty that is Boulder sits the majestic <em>Earl House Historic Inn</em>.</p>

<p><a href="http://blog.lesterpickerphoto.com/wp-content/uploads/2010/07/earlext.jpg"><img class="size-full wp-image-295" title="earlext" src="http://blog.lesterpickerphoto.com/wp-content/uploads/2010/07/earlext.jpg" alt="" width="244" height="243"></a></p>

<p>Built in 1882 by wealthy New Yorkers who eventually settled in Boulder, Earl House radiates the warmth of its Victorian heritage. “I keep hearing from guests that it’s the nicest and most elegant inn they’ve ever stayed at,” reports Kathryn Ode, Manager, beaming with pride. From the oak, cherry and mahogany woodwork that greet you in the marvelous foyer, to the Thomas Hatfield sofas that invite you to relax for a while, Ode might just be right.</p>

<p>One of the keystones of Earl House are the one-of-a-kind ceramic tiles that adorn the fireplaces, each one hand-painted by Mrs. Greene, the original owner. The inn owners, Jeffrey White and Matthew Dyross, have complemented her artistic decor with a full-wall mural painted by local artist Ben Brown, who also hand painted the tiles in each of the inn’s bathrooms.</p>

<p>Earl House’s intimate atmosphere is embellished by rooms such as The Bird’s Eye Maple Room, elegantly finished throughout with hand carved bird’s eye maple trim, fireplace mantel and arched gothic balcony door. Victorian antiques add the perfect romantic touch. Each of the five other rooms features private baths and distinctive Victorian themes.</p>

<p>The pleasures of Earl House come alive each morning when Kathryn and her staff prepare a breakfast of delights fit for kings and queens, then serve it with lavish attention to the guest experience. The parlor’s three breakfast tables are set with fine linens and china, with fresh fruits, home-made muesli, pastries and yogurts, and endless pots of fresh brewed coffee, tastefully spread on the library table. Guests are free to sit in the parlor, where exquisite hand carved fruitwood butler tables flank upholstered Victorian couches and chairs. Guests relax with a cup of steaming coffee as the courteous staff bring the daily papers.</p>

<p>Earl House Historic Inn , 2429 Broadway, Boulder, CO 80304; 303/938-1400. Six rooms in Inn, all w/private baths. Rates $139 to $179; Gourmet continental-plus breakfasts, afternoon tea and evening port included. Two carriage houses, 3 bedrooms each. Cancellation policy. No smoking, no pets. All major credit cards.</p>

<h2>Gold Lake Mountain Resort</h2>


<p>If the Earl House is the quintessential example of a city inn, then <em>Gold Lake Mountain Resort</em>, just twenty minutes northeast of Boulder, is surely its country cousin on a grand scale. Of all the majestic vistas in the Rockies, this is the very site where Chief Niwot chose to do his vision quests. And no wonder. The scenery simply takes one’s breath away.</p>

<p>Gold Lake Mountain Resort is the dreamchild of inn-trepreneurs Alice and Karel Starek. From the tastefully decorated cabins, guests have magnificent views of Gold Lake and the Continental Divide, their snow-capped peaks alluring even in summer. Guests can fish, swim, boat, mountain bike, ride horses, snowshoe, ice skate or cross-country ski, depending on the season.</p>

<p>The Starek’s have created a first-class resort worthy of the regal natural setting in every conceivable way. The eclectic yet elegant cabins reflect architect Alice’s sense of style and function. Tubs in the cabins include hammered copper surrounds, crafted by two local artists, which are sure to exact oohs and aahs from first time guests. Colorado slate bathroom floors are heated. Each cabin has a pot-belly stove, which guests may forego when they see the singular treats waiting for them in the bedroom. Puffed up a full sixteen inches or more are down comforters that mirror the expansive spaces of the West.</p>

<p>The Starek’s are visionaries when it comes to environmental impact. They have a full-time “restoration ecologist” on staff, whose job it is to steadily bring all aspects of the operation in synch with the God-given beauty of the area. Aside from composting all kitchen wastes, heavily trafficked areas are being restored to native grasses. Future plans include meeting electrical demands with solar arrays.</p>

<p>But, it is on the culinary side of the ledger that Gold Lake Resort ‘takes the cake,’ so to speak. Chef Nicholas Petti has advanced the state of the culinary arts, blending organic ingredients with just the right herbs in an artful presentation that is the equivalent of gastronomic heaven. Pan Seared Duck Breast with Blackberry/Sage Sauce and Sweet Potato Spaetzle share the menu with vegetarian dishes such as Savory Green Lentil Cake with Grilled Portobello Mushroom and Wild Rice.</p>

<p>Alice’s Restaurant, with its high ceilings and exposed wood, is the perfect complement to Petti’s creations. The restaurant’s romantic ambience blends locally made wood furniture and huge stone fireplace into a rustic sophistication that reflects the Starek’s loving restoration.</p>

<p>As if the setting and décor aren’t enough, guests can indulge themselves in a full array of spa services, from dual massages, to aromatherapy and herbal wraps. The indoor hot tub is only outdone by the two outdoor spas that are idyllically located on the shore of 35-acre Gold Lake, with a you-can-die-for panoramic view of the Continental Divide.</p>

<p>Gold Lake Mountain Resort &amp; Spa, 3371 Gold Lake Road, Ward, CO 80481, 800/450-3544. Seventeen units, all w/private baths. Swiss-style continental buffet breakfasts. Cancellation policy. No smoking, no pets. Visa, Discover and MasterCard only.</p>

<p><strong>Colorado Springs</strong></p>

<h2>Room at the Inn</h2>


<p>Ninety minutes due south of Boulder is Colorado Springs, the second largest city in the state. As a cultural and scenic hub, visitors are enamoured with historic names that are indelibly etched into our American consciousness. Names like Pike’s Peak, Cripple Creek, and the enchanting Garden of the Gods, revered by our Native American brothers and sisters, come to mind. As you approach the city, the modernistic spires of the Air Force Academy greet you in all their spiritual splendor, securely nestled against their mountainous backdrop.</p>

<p>Apropos to its name, <em>Room at the Inn</em> proprietors Jan and Chick McCormick welcome guests with an openness that is at once refreshing and sincere. Having grown up on a farm, Jan is the perfect hostess, greeting guests at the door, handling special requests, and serving her specialty multi-course breakfasts. “I enjoy making sure our guests have everything they need,” Jan says with her enchanting smile. “I love the activity in the Inn and people milling about relaxing and having a good time.”</p>

<p>Located in the historic center of Colorado Springs, Room at the Inn retains all the Victorian charm of its 1896 origins. All five guest rooms in the main house include private baths, queen size beds and a collection of period antiques that the McCormick’s have personally chosen to add touches of elegance or functionality to every nook and cranny. The third floor High Tower Room, for example, boasts an airy octagonal turret sitting room overlooking trees and garden, a French Walnut queen size bed and antiques tucked into corners that lend the perfect finishing touches for curling up with a good book. Not lacking in modern conveniences either, several rooms have whirlpool tubs for two.</p>

<p>Perhaps the most striking attention-getter at Room at the Inn is what guests notice is missing – dust and dirt. The McCormick’s pride themselves on the cleanliness of their inn. Guests are hard-pressed to find even a cobweb strand anywhere in this immaculately clean house.</p>

<p>The McCormick’s create an atmosphere of warm hospitality which revolves around their gourmet food. Each morning Jan and Chick prepare a full gourmet breakfast for guests. On a recent crisp summer morning, guests dined on the porch tables which were covered in white tablecloths and fine china. Inn staff started guests with a scrumptious dish of Hot Baked Pears with Oatmeal-Cranberry-Blueberry Sauce, delicately balanced between lightness and sweetness.</p>

<p>Next on the menu were Raspberry Streusal Muffins, followed by Baked Peach Pancakes with Honey-Raisin Sauce, complemented by endless cups of specially roasted coffee and fresh squeezed orange juice.</p>

<p>Afternoon tea includes an astounding seventy different varieties from around the world, accompanied by Jan’s homemade pastries and cookies.</p>

<p>Room at the Inn, 618 North Nevada Avenue, Colorado Springs, CO 80903; 719/442-1896. Five units in Main House, and two units in Cottage, all w/private baths. Full gourmet breakfast, afternoon tea and evening desserts included. Cancellation policy. No smoking. All major credit cards.</p>

<h2>Cheyenne Canyon Inn</h2>


<p><a href="http://blog.lesterpickerphoto.com/wp-content/uploads/2010/07/images.jpeg"><img class="size-full wp-image-297 " title="images" src="http://blog.lesterpickerphoto.com/wp-content/uploads/2010/07/images.jpeg" alt="" width="240" height="192"></a></p>

<p>Just blocks away from downtown, one approaches the majesty of South Cheyenne Canyon and its natural wonder, Seven Falls, both of which are visible from the eclectic <em>Cheyenne Canyon Inn</em>. The huge 13,000 square foot house, built in the 1920’s, was formerly a bordello and gambling casino in its shadier days. There are even secret tunnels radiating from the basement, where patrons could disappear into the night woods in case of a police raid. Today, innkeepers Barbara, John and Josh Starr have turned the inn into a bed and breakfast showcase.</p>

<p>But, before entering, be forewarned. The kindly ghost of a petite young lady of the night, dressed in white, has been seen by guests walking down the wide main staircase, disappearing as she enters the cavernous Great Room, with its seven foot windows and spectacular views of Cheyenne Mountain. There are still impressions in the oak floor where the original gambling machines earned their keep.</p>

<p>Each of the seven rooms in the inn, and the secluded chateau, reflects a different country theme, from hacienda to cabana, from Swiss chalet to African hut, all connected to the worldwide living experiences of the Starr’s, while John worked for a chemical company.</p>

<p>Guests of Cheyenne Canyon Inn tend to rise early to take advantage of the region as the hummingbird capital of the state. Feeders on the property and directly across the road at the nature center attract them, providing hour upon hour of viewing pleasure. A hummingbird stained glass window in the inn buoys the spirit when the morning sun illuminates its playful birds.</p>

<p>All the major renovation work was done by John, who blames <em>Country Inns</em> for his passion for the genre. “<em>Country Inns</em> is responsible for us being in the B &amp; B business,” John says smiling. “But we’re happy with the end result, creating an atmosphere where people can relax within hours of arriving.”</p>

<p>And relaxing, according to the Starr’s, is enigmatically tied to the dining experience. Each morning, Barbara and her son, Josh, serve guests a full breakfast featuring a different country theme. “When people are on vacation they’re not dieting,” Barbara says as she prepares a luscious batch of malted waffles, “so our food is indulgent and full of choices for our guests.”</p>

<p>With Barbara cooking behind the scenes, John and Josh pamper their guests with a Parsley Cheese Quiche featuring aromatic herbs from their garden. Individually prepared malted waffles with homemade Caramel Pecan Sauce are eagerly anticipated by repeat guests. A bowl of refreshing Cold Cantaloupe Soup clears the palate, followed by Barbara’s Two-Layer Blueberry Cake.</p>

<p>Hiking and bicycling paths leave the inn property, winding their way through the adjoining natural areas, a good thing to do when you finally push yourself away from Barbara’s indulgent treats.</p>

<p>Cheyenne Canyon Inn,2030 West Cheyenne Boulevard, Colorado Springs, CO 80906; 719/633-0625. Seven units in Main House, and one Chateau, all w/private baths. Full gourmet breakfast, afternoon tea and evening desserts included. Cancellation policy. No smoking, no pets. All major credit cards.</p>

<p><strong>The Outer Banks</strong></p>

<p>By Lester Picker</p>

<p>With more than 300 miles of coastline, the Outer Banks has stretches of sand that are consistently rated among the top beaches in the world. Whether you crave an active water vacation or a spiritually recharging barefoot walk along empty beaches, the Outer Banks has it all.</p>

<p>The Outer Banks is just a 6- or 7-hour drive from Baltimore. The sense of place can change markedly from one milepost to another. For a family with school-age children, the beaches from Duck to Nag’s Head pulse with activity. The hubbub comes with choices of restaurants, amusement rides, museums, events and water activities galore.</p>

<p><a href="http://blog.lesterpickerphoto.com/wp-content/uploads/2010/07/outerbanks_2007-10-06_2%C2%A9LesterPicker.jpg"><img class="size-medium wp-image-280" title="outerbanks_2007-10-06_2©LesterPicker" src="http://blog.lesterpickerphoto.com/wp-content/uploads/2010/07/outerbanks_2007-10-06_2%C2%A9LesterPicker-234x300.jpg" alt="" width="234" height="300"></a></p>

<p>Those who crave a quieter time could hardly do better than to spend time along Cape Hatteras National Seashore, where contemplative walks are measured in miles of undeveloped seashore. Nature lovers, especially birders, have much to indulge their passion. The National Seashore offers shelter to millions of migratory and endemic birds. Shell collectors can spend days sifting through the treasures that the oceans deposit at their feet.</p>

<p>Marylanders should note that, unlike Ocean city, the Outer Banks go on and on and on. The stretch from the Virginia border to Cape Hatteras alone is 100 miles. Here are some options for places to stay, eat and recreate, sprinkled along that beach route.</p>

<p><strong>Lodging</strong></p>

<p>There is no shortage of hotels along the Outer Banks. Most of the major chains are  represented. The trick is booking early for choice locations (think beachfront) and prices.</p>

<p><strong>Attractions</strong></p>

<p>There are more family-friendly attractions on the Outer Banks than one would expect to find in a beach locale. Most are free or low-cost.</p>

<p><strong>Maui</strong></p>

<p>by Lester Picker</p>

<p>I love Hawaii. Few destinations in the world offer as much variety, as much depth and breadth of experience, as much visual pleasure, as do the Hawaiian islands. Born of cataclysm in the middle of the Pacific Ocean a million or so years ago, the islands today offer so many options, I always threaten to stay. When my vacations there wind down, I find my To-Do list already growing for the next visit. There are the hikes near the volcano that I still want to take on the Big Island of Hawaii, the shops I want to visit on Oahu, the breathtaking walks along Kauai’s Napali coast. But, of all the Hawaiian islands, I find myself most irresistibly drawn back to Maui.</p>

<p><a href="http://blog.lesterpickerphoto.com/wp-content/uploads/2010/07/Maui_2009-02-17_1%C2%A9LesterPicker.jpg"><img class="size-medium wp-image-290" title="Maui_2009-02-17_1©LesterPicker" src="http://blog.lesterpickerphoto.com/wp-content/uploads/2010/07/Maui_2009-02-17_1%C2%A9LesterPicker-300x184.jpg" alt="" width="300" height="184"></a></p>

<p><strong>An Island of Contrasts</strong></p>

<p>Dwarfed by its larger sister, Hawaii - known as the “Big island” - Maui is the second largest island in the chain. But what it lacks in size it more than makes up for in variety. I love being able to drive from an upscale, urban mall to a 400-foot, wilderness waterfall in little more than an hour.</p>

<p>Maui is roughly 45 miles long by 30 miles wide at its widest point. But within that territory are ten thousand foot elevation changes, desert areas, tropical rain forests and endless seacoast. Rainfall on the northwest side of the island, within the West Maui Forest Reserve, averages more than 300 inches a year! Yet drive 45-minutes down the coast to Wailea and rainfall averages a desert-like 16 inches a year.</p>

<p>Shopping on Maui is nothing short of world class, with major retailers well represented and big-box stores abundant. But, get real. You’re not going to Maui to shop at Wal-Mart. One of the joys of shopping on Maui is in exploring its small towns, walking up and down quaint streets and shopping the one-of-a-kind boutique arts and crafts stores.</p>

<p>And then there are Maui’s restaurants. The island is a virtual smorgasbord of foods, from the typical fast food joints to 5-star gourmet experiences from the likes of Master Chef Wolfgang Puck (<em>Spago</em> Restaurant at The Four Seasons Resort in Waimea). In short, Maui offers everything I could possibly want, comfortably wrapped in a manageable island setting.</p>

<p><strong>Getting Around</strong></p>

<p>Despite commercial developments over the past few decades, Maui’s shoreline is still mostly undeveloped, much of it forever so. Huge tracts of land are either state or national parkland. Vistas are expansive, the clouds are beautiful and every few miles you’ll want to jump out to take pictures. That is why I find driving on Maui to be mostly a joy.</p>

<p>Notice I say “mostly.” There are trouble spots, like on a recent weekend evening when my wife and I tried to drive to Lahaina to meet a couple of friends for dinner. As they say, fuggedaboudit! Because of congestion on the narrow road, we were 45-minutes late. But thanks to the laid-back island attitude, the maitre de sat us promptly. There are also the typical minor traffic backups in and around popular shopping areas, like Kahului’s malls.</p>

<p><a href="http://blog.lesterpickerphoto.com/wp-content/uploads/2010/07/Maui_2009-02-24_3%C2%A9LesterPicker.jpg"><img class="size-medium wp-image-288" title="Maui_2009-02-24_3©LesterPicker" src="http://blog.lesterpickerphoto.com/wp-content/uploads/2010/07/Maui_2009-02-24_3%C2%A9LesterPicker-300x200.jpg" alt="" width="300" height="200"></a></p>

<p>But for me, there are few drives in the world that can compete with the famous (or infamous) Road to Hana, a mostly elevated, sometimes hair-raising 55-mile drive along the coast with non-stop, stunning views of ocean, lava fields and tropical forest. No matter what the guidebooks estimate the drive should take, I literally double that so I have time to stop frequently, take photos, and hike closer to the many waterfalls and crashing ocean waves I pass. If you’re afraid of heights, be warned. At points along this drive you may have to peel your fingers off the steering wheel. A simple solution I employ is to drive southeast from Kahului. That way I stay on the inside lane and stretch my supply of anti-anxiety meds.</p>

<p>Another of my favorite drives is the 38-mile inland route to the tiny town of Kula. I savor the commanding views of the island that open up as we climb 10,000 feet toward the Haleakala volcano. My wife and I always plan extra time to stop at the roadside fruit stands. Like their counterparts throughout the islands, I guarantee you will never find fresher or tastier fresh fruits anywhere. My personal favorites are Maui’s tiny apple bananas, which have a distinct, crisp taste. Of course, Maui’s sweet pineapples are world renowned, but the mangoes and papayas are every bit as succulent.</p>

<p>This past winter, we took an early morning drive to the <em>Kula Lodge</em>, a Bed &amp; Breakfast near Haleakala National Park that boasts a sweeping coastal view encompassing Wailea, Kihei and (almost) Lahaina. We ate a delectable breakfast of eggs benedict and their signature home fries, chased by cup after cup of steaming, black Kona coffee, all the while soaking in the view through the oversized windows. When we were done, we ambled through the Lodge’s colorful wildflower gardens and their lush tropical fruit trees.</p>

<p>One final hint about driving on Maui. Whatever the season, take along a jacket or rain parka. As you pass from jungle to open areas, valleys to mountaintops, the weather can change quickly, with wind chill drops of as much as thirty degrees.</p>

<p><strong>The Active Lifestyle</strong></p>

<p>On our third day on Maui, we started out in the early morning and took the Road to Hana in time to get to the Ohe’o Gulch parking area before lunch. From there we hiked to the picturesque, 400-foot tall Waimoku waterfall, a moderate, but long hike that winds through a sacred bamboo forest. There is simply no way to describe how dense the tree growth here is. A small group of teens hiked behind us and even they were awed into silence once we entered the depths of this magnificent preserve. All around us bamboo trees towered, blocking out the sun and creaking and groaning each time the ocean breezes blew across the mountain.</p>

<p>We arrived at the towering waterfall in time for a leisurely lunch, admiring the cascading falls and the mini-rainbows they produced. Refreshed, we headed back for the car. But a  chance encounter with a friendly local couple rewarded us with one of the highlights of our visit. They steered us past a fork in the path, where a sign warned of dangerous conditions. They assured us that if we were cautious, we would be in for a treat. Carefully, we edged past the sign and within a hundred yards, we came upon a series of pools that magically originated out of the rock face of the mountain, each one as placid and inviting as the next. We were stunned by their beauty, protected as they were by a heavy forest canopy. As we approached the last pool, we noticed that it cascaded over a precipice. We approached very cautiously and in a few steps we were stunned to see that we literally stood atop a 200-foot waterfall. Below us lay the most verdant valley we have ever seen. Our eyes soaked in the stunning view, with the Pacific Ocean in the distance. Yet another series of waterfalls plunged down the side of the valley to our left. With no one else around, it felt like a scene from prehistoric times.</p>

<p>From serious climbs to leisurely strolls, Maui is hiker heaven. On the sixth day of our stay, we both felt tired, so we took a relaxed hike in Iao Valley State Park, conveniently located near the narrowest part of the island and easily accessible from most population centers. We decided to hike to the Iao Needle, a natural spire that juts up from the valley floor and was considered a sacred site by the ancient Hawaiians. It was also the site of major battles between tribal rivals and there are burial grounds within the park that add to its religious significance.</p>

<p>Beyond hiking, the active lifestyle reigns supreme on Maui. Horseback riding, surfing, bicycling, golf, hang-gliding, parasailing, kayaking and SCUBA diving adventures can be found all over the island. Adventure outfitters are readily available for those who want to avoid the hassles of arranging all the details themselves.</p>

<p><strong>Whale of a Time</strong></p>

<p>Probably the most sought-after Maui experience for vacationers is whale watching. And no wonder. Every year, family groups of humpback whales come to the Hawaiian islands to bask in the warm waters, feeding on the abundant krill and seemingly vacationing themselves. Young whales frolic with each other, rolling over and over, while their parents perform aerial acrobatics as they rocket from the water.</p>

<p>My wife and I chose a wonderful sunset whale watching trip out of the harbor in Ma’alaea Bay. If it’s your first whale watching excursion, I recommend booking a trip through the Pacific Whale Foundation, although nearly every boat captain can place you alongside whales during the December through May season. The Foundation is a non-profit organization and part of the proceeds fund whale research.</p>

<p>On this particular evening, with plenty of sunlight still left, we were treated to more than a dozen whales breaching out of the water, landing with thunderous splashes and huge plumes of water. We got close enough to one family group to hear them exhaling through their blowholes, the mists lingering around the boat. With the sun setting, we headed back to the dock, highly satisfied with all our sightings. Suddenly, there was a massive explosion from the water just 100 yards to our left and two adult females breached in unison, a spectacular finale to a perfect cruise.</p>

<p>After our cruise we drove 20 minutes to Lahaina, which is one of our favorite haunts on Maui. Lahaina is an old whaling village, a true irony on an island that draws considerable revenue from preserving whale habitat and serving up whales nowadays through binoculars and cameras. Today Lahaina is a tourist paradise, chock full of unique boutiques and great restaurants.</p>

<p>One of Lahaina’s most famous attractions is its banyan tree, the largest in the state. It’s aerial roots have extended every which way for the length of a city block, so that it is perennially shady under its massive branches. It is an incredible sight, well worth seeing. But, heed my warning. Do not stroll under its branches after nightfall. The humongous tree is home to literally thousands of birds. Their collective chattering when they return each evening is nearly deafening. As my wife and I ate dinner directly across the street one night, two young couples walking under its canopy emerged nearly white-haired, their clothing similarly splattered.</p>

<p>Lahaina has more than its share of good restaurants. One of them, <em>Pacifico</em>, is right on the beach and prides itself in fresh caught seafood, exquisitely prepared by their chef. On our last night in Lahaina, we made reservations for an hour before sunset and sipped an excellent wine as we watched the sun sink into the Pacific Ocean.</p>

<p>After dinner, we strolled down Front Street, popping into the various galleries and arts and crafts stores. We couldn’t resist a macadamia nut ice cream cone at <em>Lappert’s</em>, one of our favorite Maui rituals.</p>

<p><strong>On the Beach</strong></p>

<p><a href="http://blog.lesterpickerphoto.com/wp-content/uploads/2010/07/Maui_2009-02-18_2%C2%A9LesterPicker.jpg"><img class="alignright size-medium wp-image-289" title="Maui_2009-02-18_2©LesterPicker" src="http://blog.lesterpickerphoto.com/wp-content/uploads/2010/07/Maui_2009-02-18_2%C2%A9LesterPicker-199x300.jpg" alt="" width="199" height="300"></a>Between hiking, whale watching and scenic driving, we sometimes have to schedule beach time when we’re in Maui, which is a little nuts since Maui’s beaches are consistently rated among the Top Ten on world lists. All beaches in Hawaii are accessible by the public, even those in front of upscale beach resorts. Most of Maui’s coastline is still rugged and inaccessible. But, if the beach is sandy and you can get to it, you can use it.</p>

<p>One of the most incredible things about Maui’s beaches is that you can often whale watch right from your beach chair. The water immediately off shore is deep, so whales tend to hug the coast in their search for food and protected play areas. We always bring along binoculars and scan for spouts, then follow their antics. If you keep your eyes open as you drive, you will often see cars pulled off the road on bluffs, where people gather to whale-watch.</p>

<p>Snorkeling, a big tourist pastime should only be attempted from recommended beaches. Currents and wave action can be severe in places. But, given the right beach, snorkeling is incredibly inviting. I remember the very first time I dived in Maui’s waters. My host, a marine biologist, apologized for the poor underwater visibility that day, which was at least one hundred feet, since I could see our anchor clearly on the bottom. Back East, I’d be happy with twenty feet visibility.</p>

<p>Rather than carry diving equipment from the mainland, my wife and I rent from one of the many dive shops around the island. Daily and weekly rental fees are quite reasonable due to the intense competition among shops.</p>

<p>But, let’s face it, it’s no secret why any of us really go to the beach. To that end Maui offers up the world’s best beach napping experience. Slather on the sunscreen, pull your cap over your eyes, take a deep breath of the salt air and lay back. Maui’s rolling waves and gentle tropical breezes will do the rest.</p>

		  <div class="entry-content"><p>Okay, I’ll admit it. I’ve been so damned busy over the last 30+ years teaching others how to improve their photography, I’ve never actually taken a photographic workshop as a participant. I do follow the emerging trends, new techniques, and the latest-greatest advances in equipment. But most of all I pay attention to the younger artists who are not resigned to old ways of doing things. They are the engines that drive our craft forward.</p>

<h3>Darwin Wiggett</h3>


<p><a href="http://blog.lesterpickerphoto.com/wp-content/uploads/2010/07/biophoto.jpg"><img class="size-full wp-image-231 " title="biophoto" src="http://blog.lesterpickerphoto.com/wp-content/uploads/2010/07/biophoto.jpg" alt="" width="240" height="160"></a></p>

<p>One of those artists I follow and admire greatly is Darwin Wiggett, a talented Canadian pro whose career I have watched evolve over the past decade. Darwin is a passionate advocate of our craft. He has a unique and creative vision – and an absolute mastery of his equipment – that is reflected in his art. Just take a look at his website to see what I mean (<a href="http://www.darwinwiggett.com">www.darwinwiggett.com</a>).</p>

<p>So, finally, after four decades of photography, I succumbed and enrolled in one of Darwin’s Canadian Rockies workshops. Now that I’m a graduate, all I can say is “Wow!”</p>

<p><a href="http://blog.lesterpickerphoto.com/wp-content/uploads/2010/07/glance_aurumlodge.jpg"><img class="size-full wp-image-238 " title="glance_aurumlodge" src="http://blog.lesterpickerphoto.com/wp-content/uploads/2010/07/glance_aurumlodge.jpg" alt="" width="172" height="129"></a></p>

<p>Darwin is a master, yet his workshops aren’t lecture-filled napfests. Within moments of arriving at eco-friendly Aurum Lodge (<a href="http://www.aurumlodge.com">www.aurumlodge.com</a>), Alan and Madeleine Ernst‘s inviting home away from home, you are immersed in a magical world of nature and landscape photography. There are no distractions, just pure unadulterated photo joy.</p>

<h3>Darwin&#8217;s Typical Workshop Day</h3>


<p>Our small group ranged from rank amateurs to successful pros, men and women, whose sole objective was to learn from Darwin and improve their craft. The morning after we arrived we awoke at 4:00 AM, to ensure that we were in place for sunrise, a pattern that was repeated every day for the duration of the 5-day experience. For the next 16 hours we drove from site to site, photographing some of the most spectacular landscapes on Earth.</p>

<p><a href="http://blog.lesterpickerphoto.com/wp-content/uploads/2010/07/LesterPicker_BanffNationalPark_landscape.jpg-1-of-1.jpg"><img class="size-medium wp-image-242 " title="LesterPicker_BanffNationalPark_landscape.jpg 1 of 1" src="http://blog.lesterpickerphoto.com/wp-content/uploads/2010/07/LesterPicker_BanffNationalPark_landscape.jpg-1-of-1-300x199.jpg" alt="" width="300" height="199"></a></p>

<p><a href="http://blog.lesterpickerphoto.com/wp-content/uploads/2010/07/StickInTheMud1.jpg"><img class="size-medium wp-image-243 " title="StickInTheMud" src="http://blog.lesterpickerphoto.com/wp-content/uploads/2010/07/StickInTheMud1-300x200.jpg" alt="" width="180" height="120"></a></p>

<p>Sometimes we’d spend 2 hours in one spot, other times perhaps 30 minutes, but suffice it to say it was never quite enough, at least for me. Except for the day I stepped into muddy quicksand at the edge of a remote, freezing cold, sulfurous-smelling pond. I quickly sank up to my thighs and had visions of being swallowed up whole. Fortunately Darwin and one of the other participants, Dawn Traverse, saw me take the plunge and rescued my camera (first) and me (second). The  bad news for me was I had to deal with being wet the rest of the day. Even worse, my fellow work-shoppers had to deal with the smell.</p>

<p>One of the things I appreciated most about Darwin’s style is that he is not intrusive. If any of us had questions, he shared his knowledge freely and in sufficient depth to satisfy beginner to expert. If we were all absorbed in the photographic moment, we might observe Darwin off somewhere taking his own images, putting into practice his emphasis on strong foreground elements, for example</p>

<p>Evenings- what little there was of evenings when you’re getting up at 4:00 and shooting for 16 hours- were spent immersed in wide-ranging conversation, albeit mostly about photography. Darwin sets the tone and everyone was supportive of each other’s efforts.</p>

<h3>Learning From Photo Workshops</h3>


<p>The last night we either showed our colleagues some of our images or asked for critiques or perhaps brought a few chosen images to showcase our work. By then we had bonded and critiques were well-intended and well-received.</p>

<p>So, I’ve changed my tune about workshops. I learned a great deal just by observing Darwin’s techniques and sharing his passion for his craft. That alone has energized my work. I also had an opportunity to visit some iconic as well as little known locations in the Canadian Rockies, each one spectacular in its own right. I also enjoyed and benefitted from the enthusiasm, dedication and knowledge-base of my fellow participants. The bottom line is I can’t wait to try another workshop.</p>

<p><em>“I am convinced that there is no air in the world like the air of Maine.”</em></p>

<ul>
<li>Mrs. John D. Rockefeller writing from Bar Harbor in 1944</li>
</ul>


<p><strong>Bar Harbor </strong>by Lester Picker</p>

<p>Bar Harbor, the hub of Mount Desert Island, is a sleepy island community in Frenchman’s Bay for 8 months of the year, with a population of just 2,600.  But, from June through September, the island is host to some 4 million visitors, who come to take in the sights, sounds, tastes and ocean smells of Acadia National Park, which occupies the majority of the island.</p>

<p><a href="http://blog.lesterpickerphoto.com/wp-content/uploads/2010/07/Maine-2009-Longpond-hdr.jpg"><img class="size-medium wp-image-274" title="Maine 2009-Longpond-hdr" src="http://blog.lesterpickerphoto.com/wp-content/uploads/2010/07/Maine-2009-Longpond-hdr-199x300.jpg" alt="" width="199" height="300"></a></p>

<p>Amazingly, only a tiny percentage of visitors ventures off the well-worn roads to take advantage of the eco-tourism this island paradise offers, according to National Park officials.  The spectacular beauty and ecological abundance of the Maine coast makes Bar Harbor the ideal base for the kind of hiking, biking, canoeing and kayaking, that enables the entire family to learn first-hand about our natural world.</p>

<p><strong><em>What To Do</em></strong></p>

<p><strong><em>Whale Watching</em></strong>.  Each year the whales return, playing in their family pods and fattening up on the abundance of sea life just offshore. Four separate whale-watching boats make Bar Harbor their home, plying the waters of Frenchman’s Bay.  For four hours you’ll ooh and aah alongside frolicking Humpbacks, Fin, Right and Minke whales, some of them eighty feet long and breaching just yards from the ship.</p>

<p>Dozens of sightings are the norm from June through mid-October, and an experienced naturalist interprets events for you.  A videographer accompanies many trips, so you can purchase a lifetime of memories of your family amidst whales and the glory of Downeast Maine islands.  All boats offer money-back or exchange-ticket guarantees if no whales are sighted.  If you are prone to sea-sickness, be sure to take medication prior to departing, as seas can sometimes be choppy.</p>

<p>In May and June, there is only one trip a day, seven days a week.  In July, August and September, there are 3 trips a day, seven days a week.  The trip lasts approximately 4-hours.</p>

<p>From the Bar Harbor town pier, take the 105 foot <em>Whale Watcher</em>, a modern, comfortable passenger cruiser, with 360 degree decks designed for optimum viewing (contact Whale Watcher, Inc., 1 West Street, Bar Harbor, ME  04609: 207-288-3322).  Or, try the 112 foot <em>Friendship V, </em>the<em> </em>brand new, jet-powered catamaran leaving from the Blue Nose Ferry Terminal (contact Bar Harbor Whale Watch Co., 39 Cottage Street, Bar Harbor, ME  04609: 207-288-2386).  The 94 foot <em>Acadian Whale Watcher</em> leaves from the Holiday Inn SunSpree Resort pier, located next to the Blue Nose Ferry Terminal (contact Acadian Whale Watcher Co., Route 3, Bar Harbor, ME 04609: 207-288-9794).  Finally, the XX foot <em>Sea Bird Watcher</em> leaves from its West Street pier near the town pier (contact Sea Bird Watcher Co., 52 West Street, Bar Harbor, ME  04609: 207-288-2025).</p>

<p><strong><em>Nature Cruise</em></strong>.  If chasing whales isn’t your cup of tea, or you have less time available, try the delightful one or two-hour sunset nature cruises offered by all four whale-watching companies.  As you cruise among the rugged islands of Frenchman’s Bay, the kids will be delighted by close-up views of seals, harbor porpoises, puffins, ospreys, eagles and other wildlife in their natural environment.  Trained naturalists accompany these cruises, patiently answering all questions. Bring your camera and wear warm clothes.  Even on warm summer days it is commonly 20 degrees cooler on Maine waters.</p>

<p><strong><em>Sea Kayaking</em></strong>.  There simply can’t be a better way to explore Maine’s waters than by kayak.  You’re seated low in the water, with a seal’s eye view of the world around you.  Best of all, kayaks are more stable than canoes and easier to maneuver.</p>

<p><a href="http://blog.lesterpickerphoto.com/wp-content/uploads/2010/07/othellomtns1-1.jpg"><img class="size-medium wp-image-270" title="Maine coast" src="http://blog.lesterpickerphoto.com/wp-content/uploads/2010/07/othellomtns1-1-300x199.jpg" alt="" width="300" height="199"></a></p>

<p>All Bar Harbor companies offer trips for novices, families, and experienced kayakers, including half-day, full-day and multi-day tours, with experienced guides.  In a typical half-day tour for beginners, you’ll start out near the Bar Harbor town pier and receive basic instruction.  In no time, the naturalist-guides are leading your group from island to island, among the dozens of picturesque islands in sight of Bar Harbor.  Be prepared to see eagles, ospreys, seals and, if you’re lucky, a rare puffin or two.</p>

<p>Contact Coastal Kayaking Tours, Inc., 48 Cottage Street, Bar Harbor, ME  04609: 207-288-9605;  National Park Sea Kayak Tours, Inc., 137 Cottage Street, Bar Harbor, ME  04609: 207-288-0342; or Bar Harbor Bicycle and Kayak Shop, 141 Cottage Street, Bar Harbor, ME  04609: 207-288-3886.</p>

<p><strong><em>Bicycling</em></strong>.  Forget any preconceived notions about biking when you visit Bar Harbor.  You won’t have to worry about dangerous roads, noxious fumes, or sleazy scenery. Rent state-of-the-art bikes from one of the many bike shops in town and in five minutes you are cruising along the famous Carriage Paths in Acadia National Park.  Built at the turn of the century with funding from the Rockefeller family, these well groomed marvels of engineering wind around the unimagined beauty of Eagle Lake and Jordan Pond, past waterfalls, around mountains and through dense forest.  No cars are allowed on the 57 miles of Carriage Paths, so it’s truly a family haven.  Stop and have a picnic, or cool off under a waterfall at the entrance to the Deer Brook Trail on Sargent Mountain.</p>

<p>All bike shops provide you with safety equipment, bike racks, and a map of how to access the Carriage Paths from town.  They can also arrange to drop off the family by van.</p>

<p>Contact Acadia Bike &amp; Canoe, 48 Cottage Street, Bar Harbor, ME  04609: 207-288-9605; or Bar Harbor Bicycle and Kayak Shop, 141 Cottage Street, Bar Harbor, ME  04609: 207-288-3886.</p>

<p><strong><em>Hiking</em></strong>.  Hiking the peaks and valleys of Acadia National Park is an experience every family will cherish.  Very few of the Park’s millions of annual visitors stray beyond the familiar tourist attractions.  In thirty easy minutes a family can hike to the top of Flying Mountain for a picnic and breathtaking views of Somes Sound, the only true fjord in the eastern United States.  Its deep, blue-green water set among towering cliffs is a photographer’s dream.</p>

<p><a href="http://blog.lesterpickerphoto.com/wp-content/uploads/2010/07/othellomtns1.jpg"><img class="size-medium wp-image-272" title="Acadia NP" src="http://blog.lesterpickerphoto.com/wp-content/uploads/2010/07/othellomtns1-300x199.jpg" alt="" width="300" height="199"></a></p>

<p>More adventurous families might try The Beehive, overlooking Sand Beach, with its narrow paths, steep drops and iron ladders hammered into the cliff face to enable you to climb to a secure landing.  Or, for an all-day, strenuous treat of forests, islands, and ocean vistas, hike the Dorr Mountain granite stairs trail to Cadillac’s summit.  There are dozens of mountains and hundreds of trails to choose from in Acadia.  Just bring along plenty of water.</p>

<p>Park maps are available from Acadia National Park, P.O. Box 177, Bar Harbor, ME  04609: 207-288-3338.  Detailed trail guides, which Park experts recommend if you are hiking into the National Park, are for sale at the National Park Service Visitor Center, and at every bookstore and gift shop in Bar Harbor.</p>

<p>For a special treat, hire a personalized nature guide to show you scenic locations for photography, or to reveal the best birding locations or spots to watch beaver repairing their dams.</p>

<p>Contact Down East Nature Tours, P.O. Box 521, Bar Harbor, ME 04609: 207-288-8128 or Photoscenics, Inc., 566 Church Road, Bangor, ME 04401: 207-942-0021.</p>

<p><strong><em>Where To Stay</em></strong></p>

<p>Accommodations in Bar Harbor range from opulent to modest.  The following are two good examples of the range of accommodations available.  For peak summer season, book at least three months in advance.  Camping is also available, both within the National Park and in private campgrounds outside.</p>

<p>Immediately next to the Bluenose Ferry Terminal sits the Holiday Inn SunSpree Resort, a family-friendly haven with child sitting services and a full-day of children’s activities, 3 restaurants, a whale watching boat, plus all the amenities to satisfy adults, children and teens. Contact the SunSpree Resort at 123 Eden Street, Bar Harbor, ME 04609: 207-288-9723.</p>

<p>For families seeking a quiet retreat with picturesque views, nothing beats the quaint Edgewater Motel &amp; Cottages which, true to their name, sit on the shore at Hull’s Cove, only ten minutes from downtown Bar Harbor.  Look out your cottage window at the working lobster boats and fishing seines, and you’ll swear you’ve gone back 200 years to when current owners David and Fran Bowden’s ancestors originally bought the land.  Rooms range from $49 to $105 per night for a double, depending on season and amenities.  Cottages include dishes, linens and other amenities. Contact the Bowdens, Box 566, Bar Harbor, ME 04609: 207-288-3491.</p>

<p><strong><em>Eating Out</em></strong></p>

<p>After a day of hiking, biking, or just plain sightseeing, Bar Harbor offers a surprisingly wide range of eating choices, from inexpensive lunches to higher priced dining.  Lobster dinners are as endemic as beef dinners in Kansas City, but for out-of-the-ordinary experiences you’ll have to be adventurous.</p>

<p>Start your day with Jordan’s Famous Wild Maine Blueberry Pancakes or Blueberry Muffins at Jordan’s Restaurant on Cottage Street.  This Bar Harbor institution draws both locals and tourists in a comfortable mix that’s easy on the wallet.  Four can eat breakfast for under $30.</p>

<p>Don’t miss out on a rainy-day lunch at the West End Drug Company on Main Street, run by the Gilfillan family since 1917.  Where in today’s modern world, can you sit on bar stools at a luncheonette counter in a turn-of-the-century working pharmacy, and order a kid-pleasing grilled cheese or pb &amp; j sandwich for just two bucks?  And don’t forget to order their old-time chocolate frappe, mixed before your eyes with fresh milk, chocolate ice cream and chocolate syrup.</p>

<p>On selected weeknights, have an early dinner, then take in the Town Band concert on the Village Green at 8:00 PM.  The Norman Rockwell experience will make an indelible mark in your family’s memory lane, as adults sit on the lawn sipping coffee, kids run around the band shell, and the deep-throated sound of the Bluenose ferry echoes through the still Maine night as it leaves Bar Harbor for its overnight cruise to Yarmouth, Nova Scotia.</p>

<p>No visit to Mount Desert Island can be considered complete without “high tea” served at white tables on the lawn at the Jordan Pond House.  Dress ranges from hikers and bikers in shorts to people in sport jackets.  Sitting squarely at the edge of picturesque Jordan Pond, nestled solidly between towering Sargent Mountain and The Bubbles, the Jordan Pond House has been in continuous operation since the 1870s.  Time your bicycle ride around the Carriage Paths or your hike up Sargent Mountain to arrive between 2:30 and 5:30 on a bright, sunny day and enjoy their famous popovers with fresh Maine strawberry jam.  While waiting for your treats, roam their famous wildflower garden along the edges of the building.  It is an eating experience your family will never forget.  Reservations are not required, but to be sure, call 207-276-3316 on the day you plan to visit.</p>

<p><strong><em>Getting to Bar Harbor</em></strong></p>

<p>For those unwilling to make the family car trek all the way to Bar Harbor, major airlines such as Continental and USAir connect to Boston or Bangor, Maine.  From either airport, Colgan Air connects directly to Bar Harbor via small commuter planes.  The Bangor to Bar Harbor run is an hour-long, traffic-free jaunt by car.  Car rentals are available at Bangor and Bar Harbor airports.  Reserve well in advance on Colgan and for car rentals on peak vacation weeks.</p>

<p><strong><em>For More Information</em></strong></p>

<p>Contact the Bar Harbor Chamber of Commerce, P.O. Box 158, Bar Harbor, ME 04609-0158: 207-288-5103.</p>

		  <div class="entry-content"><p>In two weeks time I set off for another adventure, this time back to the Canadian Rockies, a landscape that I dearly love. This time I’ll take my wife and 16-year old granddaughter (God help me!).</p>

<p><a href="http://blog.lesterpickerphoto.com/wp-content/uploads/2010/07/CanadianRockies2009-3032009-10-05.jpg"><img class="size-medium wp-image-205" title="CanadianRockies2009 3032009-10-05" src="http://blog.lesterpickerphoto.com/wp-content/uploads/2010/07/CanadianRockies2009-3032009-10-05-300x199.jpg" alt="" width="300" height="199"></a></p>

<p>Right now I’m up to my eyeballs in prepping for the trip. I have to keep reminding myself that it’s about the journey, not the destination. Whoever thought that one up was definitely not a photojournalist.</p>

<p>Of course the hardest thing about this particular trip is knowing in advance that I’ll have a moody teen on my hands at various times. But Tonya is really a terrific traveler and is developing a traveler’s eye for details that I sometimes miss. She also keeps me in stitches half the time.</p>

<p>Lots of my colleagues … how do I say this delicately?&#8230; prefer not to travel with their wives. I admit that I’m that way, too, when I’m traveling to a dangerous or out of the way location. But Leslie is an asset, a true assistant when I’m working, readying a camera, scanning for interesting compositions, watching out for bears. She’s even carried a 25-pound backpack full of my gear when we hiked down one side of Maui’s Haleakala crater and up the other side, an amazing two-day trek to another world. Not bad for two 60-year olds - but that’s another story.</p>

<p>People ask me what kind of pre-trip planning it takes to do a 2-week (or 4-week) photo trip. Aside from the immense equipment and logistical issues, this one is more of a touristy trip. We’re flying to the other side of the continent to Vancouver. From there we board the Rocky Mountaineer for a two-day rail trip to Jasper, Alberta. We’ve got 4 days to explore Jasper and Banff National Parks (lots of early morning and late evening photo ops), then we’re headed back northwest on Canada’s ViaRail to Prince Rupert, a scenic city on the shores of the Inner Passage. From there we board a ferry for a 15-hour cruise along the Alaska Marine Highway and the eye candy of the Inner Passage to Port Hardy, at the northern tip of Vancouver Island. Hopefully we’ll see whales and bear and eagles along the route. We take a leisurely day to drive along the length of Vancouver Island and then ferry over to British Columbia’s Sunshine Coast, where we’ll visit some very special friends and tour Gibsons and Sechelt, before ferrying back to Vancouver and a flight home. Sounds like the movie  “Planes, Trains, and Automobiles.” I’m counting on our journey not being such a comedy of errors, though.</p>

I hate making all the detailed arrangements that such a complex trip entails. Flights, hotels, motels, trains, car rentals, ferries, lodging. Between emails and phone tag, it can take weeks before the final pieces fall into place. In fact, I’ll make a note to blog about how I go about all this in a future post, so stay tuned!</p>

<p>Oh, yeah. And then there’s the equipment. Do I need extra batteries? Should I order that new lens now in order to get some field practice with it before the trip, or wait until the last minute when I have the money to pay for it and hope for the best?</p>

<p>Believe it or not, one of the biggest pains in the rear for me is deciding which bag to take. If I’m hiking into wilderness areas, I’ve got to travel light. Everything I need is on my 62-year old, increasingly fragile body. I used to think I was the Imelda Marcus of photo bags, until I saw the closet of one of my unnamed colleagues. In this case, I’ll need two bags; one for transporting onto planes, trains, automobiles and ferries and one for hiking once I get there.</p>

<p>Okay, back to work, sorting out which equipment to take. I’ll save that for my next blog.</p>

Right now I’m going through my usual pre-trip crazies deciding what to bring. Actually, the big problem is deciding what not to bring!</p>

<p>You’d think that after 30+ years I’d have this down to a science, and I probably would if the damned field didn’t keep changing every 6 months! New cameras that include functions of 2 other devices (think multiple exposure meters and GPS devices), macro rails, a new 5mm-1,000 mm zoom lens that takes the place of 6 others (hey, I’m just kidding about that one, so please don’t write asking me where I got it). I hate packing!</p>

<p>My photo closet is always a mess. I’m either coming from an assignment or heading off to one, or grabbing a camera and lens to test something that popped into my head. So when I get down to packing I start frustrated and go downhill from there. My wife has learned to give me a minimum 10 feet of clearance when I’m readying for a trip.</p>

<p>As you can see, today I’m packing my wheeled carry-on, made by ThinkTank. I like this bag because it is their international size, meaning it fits either the overhead bin or under seat storage of nearly all airlines, although it pays nowadays to double check before heading to the airport battle zone.</p>

<p>I’ll also take my ThinkTank Rotation 360 bag for hiking the trails. Since my wife and granddaughter will be accompanying me, and our baggage will be seriously curtailed by the realities of the Canadian wilderness, I’ll have to sacrifice certain picture-taking opportunities. I’ll leave my macro equipment, since that takes a long time to set up and use and even though I’ll have two very patient women with me, I don’t want to push it. Also, no extra-long lenses, since my space is limited.</p>

<p><a href="http://blog.lesterpickerphoto.com/wp-content/uploads/2010/07/packing_2010-07-22_1819%C2%A9LesterPicker.jpg"><img class="alignnone size-medium wp-image-195" title="packing_2010-07-22_1819©LesterPicker" src="http://blog.lesterpickerphoto.com/wp-content/uploads/2010/07/packing_2010-07-22_1819%C2%A9LesterPicker-225x300.jpg" alt="" width="225" height="300"></a></p>

<p>So, after too much agonizing, here’s what made the cut.</p>

<ul>
<li>Nikon D700 (FX) and D300 (DX) bodies</li>
    <li>Nikkor lenses (17-35, 24-70, 70-200, 24mm PCE, 85mm PCE)</li>
    <li>Nikkor 1.4 tele-extender</li>
    <li>Lee graduated soft ND filters (.3, .6, .9)</li>
    <li>Singh-Ray graduated soft ND filters (1,2 and 3)</li>
    <li>Polarizers</li>
    <li>Hoodman LCD screen loop</li>
    <li>Gitzo 3541 tripod with Really Right Stuff BH55 ballhead</li>
    <li>Wimberley gimbal head</li>
    <li>Nikon SB800 flash</li>
    <li>Camera/lens cleaning kit</li>
    <li>12, 8GB storage cards</li>
    <li>500GB Western Digital portable backup drive</li>
    <li>15” MacBook Pro laptop (extra battery, cords, mouse, etc)</li>
    <li>Assorted adapters for the graduated filters</li>
    <li>Waterproof bags</li>
    <li>Tons of batteries</li>
    <li>Chargers</li>
    <li>Digital tape recorder (for notes and interviews)</li>
</ul>


<p>Some of the non-breakable stuff, like adapters, bags and cleaning kit I’ll pack in my checked bag.</p>

<p>Gotta go. Down to the wire now. Did I already mention how I hate packing???</p>

		  <div class="entry-content"><p style="text-align: center;"><strong>Ten Tips for Images With Impact</strong></p>


<p>One of the most satisfying aspects of traveling is meeting people from different cultures. Some of my fondest memories are of taking time to talk with citizens of countries I visit and learning their customs and beliefs (and their perceptions of America and Americans). I&#8217;ve been invited to dinner by a taxi driver in Cairo and met a man who has become one of my dearest Canadian friends on the bow of a ship in the far North.</p>

<p>I have a feeling that if you asked 100 professional photographers what subject matter is most difficult to photograph, most would say people. To be clear, I’m not speaking of professional portrait or wedding photographers, with their well-designed and lighted studios and automated software. No, I’m referring to travel photographers who want to capture the essence of the cultures they visit, that is, their people.</p>

<p>I’ve been doing professional travel photography for a bunch of years now, and I’m pretty often pleased with the images of people I’ve captured. So the inevitable questions I am asked are  “How do you do it? Do you have any tips for the amateur photographer that you’re willing to share?”</p>

<p>Well, yes, I do have some tips on photographing people and here they are (I welcome comments on this blog and any tips you might have that you would be willing to share with me and my readers).</p>

<ol>
<li><strong>Get Permission</strong>. Pros have it drilled into their heads that they need permission to use an image of a person, any person, for commercial purposes. But for the amateur the situation is different. Or is it?</li>
</ol>


<p>I firmly believe that it is a matter of civility, pure and simple, to ask someone you do not know for permission to photograph him or her. One of my pet peeves is the rude tourist who shoves a camera in the face of someone from a different culture. Of course, if the person is performing that is a different story. But, in my opinion, people have a right to their privacy, and as a photographer I abide by that belief.</p>

<p>Now, permission does not have to be a signed release form. It can be a gesture- holding up your camera, pointing to it and to the subject and shrugging your shoulders as if to ask the question. Or, if you speak the language, just ask.</p>

<p><a href="http://blog.lesterpickerphoto.com/wp-content/uploads/2010/02/people-2-of-7.jpg"><img class="size-medium wp-image-116 " title="Bedouin, Egypt's Eastern desert" src="http://blog.lesterpickerphoto.com/wp-content/uploads/2010/02/people-2-of-7.jpg?w=240" alt="" width="168" height="210"></a></p>

<p>In some countries, I’m thinking of Muslim countries in particular, photographing women without permission can get you in serious trouble. At the very least you owe it to your subject to give her a chance to cover her face.</p>

<p>Sometimes I admit to having photographed a subject surreptitiously, to catch a special moment or expression. In that case I always go up to them afterwards, show them the images and ask if it is okay with them. Usually their smiling faces are their answer.</p>

<p><a href="http://blog.lesterpickerphoto.com/wp-content/uploads/2010/02/people-5-of-7.jpg"><img class="size-medium wp-image-118" src="http://blog.lesterpickerphoto.com/wp-content/uploads/2010/02/people-5-of-7.jpg?w=201" alt="" width="201" height="300"></a></p>

<ol>
<li><p><strong>Get a Picture, Give a Print</strong>. One thing I like to do is either send a print to the person once I get home or else bring one with me on my next visit to the country. In Ecuador, there is a market in Otavalo where I love to spend time photographing. When I go back, I bring prints of my subjects from my last visit and now the people are excited when I return.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Be patient</strong>. One of the tips that I give my students at workshops is to be patient when you photograph people. Often it is only after 10 minutes of shooting that the subject relaxes enough for that unguarded moment.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Get to Know Your Subject</strong>. Perhaps the most enjoyable aspect of travel photography for me is getting to know my subjects, even if only for a short time. The people connection is what makes the travel experience shine. Before you hoist your camera, ask about the craft they might be exhibiting. As a grandfather five times over, I always ask my subjects about their family; it’s the universal glue that binds us. I can nearly guarantee that if you take the time to do this you will be rewarded with warm and poignant images every time.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Shoot Early</strong>. I find that a great time to shoot is early in the morning, even in westernized countries. That is when merchants set up their market stalls, when farmers heave</p></li>
</ol>


<p><a href="http://blog.lesterpickerphoto.com/wp-content/uploads/2010/02/people-6-of-7.jpg"><img class="size-medium wp-image-128 " src="http://blog.lesterpickerphoto.com/wp-content/uploads/2010/02/people-6-of-7.jpg?w=216" alt="" width="216" height="300"></a></p>

<p>their produce from cart to table, when kids scurry to help their parents or scamper away from them. The rising sun casts a warm glow, dust is kicked up highlighting dust motes, and the grittiness of life is front-and-center for your photographic palette.</p>

<p><a href="http://blog.lesterpickerphoto.com/wp-content/uploads/2010/02/people-7-of-7.jpg"><img class="size-medium wp-image-120 " title="Sechelt Coming-of-Age Ceremony" src="http://blog.lesterpickerphoto.com/wp-content/uploads/2010/02/people-7-of-7.jpg?w=200" alt="" width="200" height="300"></a></p>

<ol>
<li><strong>Tell a Story</strong>. I always tell my workshop attendees that when given a choice, shoot a scene tightly. Shooting tight conveys emotion and creates dramatic impact. You do not need the entire person’s body in the image, at times not even the entire face. A child’s face from chin to forehead, lips streaked in chocolate, can be a prize-winner.</li>
</ol>


<p>However, you need to decide before you shoot what the story is that you want to tell. Is it the expressions of toil on a merchants face, or the warm embrace of a nurturing mother? That will determine whether you shoot a tight face shot or a medium telephoto shot of the mother squatting curbside holding her daughter, or a wide angle of a bustling city square. You decide and then fill the pages of your photo book with that story.</p>

<p><a href="http://blog.lesterpickerphoto.com/wp-content/uploads/2010/02/people-3-of-7.jpg"><img class="size-thumbnail wp-image-123 " src="http://blog.lesterpickerphoto.com/wp-content/uploads/2010/02/people-3-of-7.jpg?w=100" alt="" width="100" height="150"></a></p>

<p>7.<strong> Use Flash</strong>. At certain times of the day light is harsh and creates deep shadows that distract from the subject. In many cultures people, especially men, wear wide-brimmed hats that create problems during mid-day hours. The solution in these cases is to use flash to gently fill in the shadows. Yes, pros have elaborate flash systems, but they are often superfluous. You can capture terrific shots using your on-camera, pop-up flash. The secret here is to diffuse the light so it doesn’t appear harsh on the face. There are several after-market products out there that you place over your flash to smooth the light and create pleasing portraits. In a pinch I have used a tissue or a white plastic shopping bag.</p>

<ol>
<li><p><strong>Laugh…a Lot</strong>. Laughter truly is the best medicine and I’ve used it even in uncomfortable travel situations. Just think of how funny you look to a Bedouin or a Sengali fisherman, then lighten up and laugh at yourself. That frame of mind alone will loosen up your subjects and help them be more cooperative.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Move</strong>. When shooting people, move around - talk to them as you do so – and shoot from many different angles. Digital is wonderful. Did the person blink? Just keep shooting. Was the background distracting? Move and keep shooting.</p></li>
</ol>

<ol>
<li><strong>Shoot Wide Open</strong>. I say this with a caveat, but if the person is the focus of your image, try opening up the aperture to its maximum (f2.0, 2.8, 3.5 or 4.0). That will blur the background and cause your subject to pop off the frame. That works especially well if the person’s face or dress is able to carry the story. If the story you want to tell includes the context – a dance, the village huts, animals or a spectacular backdrop, then close down the lens (f8, 11 or 16). However, that works best when your subject is close to you, creating a strong foreground element.</li>
</ol>


<p>One last piece of advice&#8230; always remember that you are a good-will ambassador. I prefer to go out of my way to show people of different cultures that we Americans are not so bad after all.</p>

		  <div class="entry-content"><p>“How do you get such saturated colors in the sky?” I am often asked.</p>

<p>“I bet you use fancy filters.”</p>

<p>“Hey, you added those colors in Photoshop, didn’t you?” wink, wink.</p>

<p>Well, my blog friends, I hate to disillusion you, but those colors come from something called sunrise. Pure, natural, 100% organic sunrise. And to capture them you have to get up before sunrise, trek to your preferred location, set up your equipment, pray that it doesn’t rain or cloud over, and then spend the next hour shooting like a maniac.</p>

<p><a rel="lightbox" href="http://blog.lesterpickerphoto.com/wp-content/uploads/2010/01/blog-sunrise-1-of-4.jpg?w=300"><img class="size-medium wp-image-101    " title="Sunrise, Yukon Territory, Canada " src="http://blog.lesterpickerphoto.com/wp-content/uploads/2010/01/blog-sunrise-1-of-4.jpg?w=300" alt="" width="150" height="150"></a></p>

<p>While everyone else is out having a good time during the day, I’m stumbling about in a sleep-deprived daze. Then, around dinnertime, I pull out one solid excuse from my Photographer’s Handbook, and sneak away for another hour of sunset shots. That, in a nutshell, is how a pro photographer captures those magical colors in the sky.</p>

<h3>Sunrise, Sunset: The Magic Hours</h3>


<p>In fact, photographers call the two hours after sunrise and before sunset the ‘magic hours.’ From the perspective of physics that makes sense. When the sun is nearly at the horizon light is penetrating considerably more atmosphere than it does at noon. That slows light down and slower light bends it toward the red end of the visible light spectrum. We humans have a proclivity for reddish colors. They seem ‘warmer’ and more pleasing and peace-inducing to our brains.</p>

<p>Early-Late light also has other properties that tend to transform snapshots into eye-candy. When the sun is low to the horizon it creates longer shadows. That adds depth and texture to images, especially to landscapes.</p>

<p><a href="http://blog.lesterpickerphoto.com/wp-content/uploads/2010/01/blog-sunrise-4-of-4.jpg"><img class="size-medium wp-image-102" title="Sunrise, Alberta, Canada" src="http://blog.lesterpickerphoto.com/wp-content/uploads/2010/01/blog-sunrise-4-of-4.jpg?w=300" alt="" width="300" height="199"></a></p>

<p>Sunrise and sunset are appealing to photographers for another reason. They are typically the hours when wildlife is most active, so your chances of capturing that perfect image of a fox or a bear or any manner of feathered creatures rise exponentially.</p>

<p>If you are traveling abroad, the hours just after sunrise are terrific for photographing local markets. There is typically a lot of hustle and bustle during that period, so with a medium telephoto lens you can stand unobtrusively in a doorway and shoot people setting up their stalls and arranging their exotic wares. (If you intend to use the images for commercial publication, be sure to get model releases from the people you photograph if they are recognizable in the photo… more on that in a later blog).</p>

<p>Sunset is an equally magical time to shoot, although you will most definitely run into more photographers at sunset than at sunrise. Sometimes the fight for photographic territory can be intense at sunset in places like the South Rim of the Grand Canyon.</p>

<p><a href="http://blog.lesterpickerphoto.com/wp-content/uploads/2010/01/blog-sunrise-3-of-4.jpg"><img class="size-medium wp-image-103" title="Arctic Sunrise" src="http://blog.lesterpickerphoto.com/wp-content/uploads/2010/01/blog-sunrise-3-of-4.jpg?w=300" alt="" width="300" height="199"></a></p>

<p>Whatever its challenges, the aesthetic rewards of shooting early and late easily make it worthwhile. And don’t think you need to travel to some exotic locale. Just set your alarm and witness your own backyard in a totally different perspective.</p>

<p>Last year I remember being in Yukon Territory. I set my alarm for 3:00 AM to photograph the spectacular northern lights over the Yukon River. In the morning, one of my local hosts asked what I was doing up so early. I mentioned my drive up the local mountain to get a good view of the aurora. He had lived in the Yukon for five years. He flat out told me that he had only seen the lights once!</p>

<h3>Equipment You Will Need</h3>


<p>In terms of equipment I <em>always</em> use my tripod for sunrise/sunset because I want maximum depth-of-field, which slows the shutter speed. Add a cable release and you are set… well, almost. I also use filters at sunrise and sunset.</p>

<p>When you photograph sunrise/sunset, the sky begins to light up while the land in the foreground is still relatively dark. The lighter sky fools your meter into thinking it needs to close down the aperture to restrict the light hitting the sensor. That will render the foreground black, with no details in the shadows.</p>

<p>The way to compensate for this is to use a graduated neutral density filter. A GND filter is a piece of plastic or glass that you place in front of the lens. It is darker at the top and gradually becomes transparent about halfway down. In essence you are putting sunglasses only on the sky portion of your image. Just slide the filter until only the sky is shaded and- voila! – you have the prefect sunrise image. GND filters come is various strengths and with trial and error, and liberal use of the histogram, you will become proficient in their use. I use GNDs from Singh Ray (<a href="http://www.singhray.com">www.singhray.com</a>) and Lee filters (<a href="http://www.leeusa.com">www.leefiltersusa.com</a>) or you can purchase them through B&amp;H (<a href="http://www.bandh.com">www.bandh.com</a>) or Adorama (<a href="http://www.adorama.com">www.adorama.com</a>). In a future blog I’ll explain how to use these GNDs in more detail.</p>

<p><a href="http://blog.lesterpickerphoto.com/wp-content/uploads/2010/01/blog-sunrise-2-of-4.jpg"><img class="size-medium wp-image-104" title="Maui Sunset" src="http://blog.lesterpickerphoto.com/wp-content/uploads/2010/01/blog-sunrise-2-of-4.jpg?w=300" alt="" width="300" height="199"></a></p>

<p>Singh-Ray makes a specialty filter known as a Daryl Benson Reverse Neutral Density Graduated Filter. I know that’s a mouthful, but here’s what it does that proves very useful. Let’s say you want to shoot a sunrise where the sun is just peeking out over the horizon. That bright orb will blow out your shot and ruin your image. The Reverse ND filter places a band of ‘sunglasses’ right across the horizon zone, holding back some of that light and allowing for a nicely exposed image in most cases.</p>

<p>Try getting up tomorrow before dawn and you’ll be amazed at what awaits in your own town or neighborhood!</p>

		  <div class="entry-content"><p>After more than 30 years in photography, I’ve come to understand that our art consists of two major distinctions. The first is creative vision, the second is technological. I’ll be writing a lot about the creative aspects of photography – the right mental attitude, the vision, the motivations- but in this blog I’ll discuss one technological issue that seems to plague amateur photographers. That is the decision to shoot in aperture priority, shutter priority or fully automatic.</p>

<p>I’ll be the first to admit that today’s DSLRs do a pretty fine job on automatic. Just set it and forget it. The camera’s onboard computer does all the calculations, averages out the exposure values in a scene and- voilà !- you have a nice photo. Coupled with autofocus, you will almost always come back with a decent photo.</p>

<p>But for a professional or advanced amateur, ‘decent’ is just not good enough. In fact, it can be the kiss of death. We look for images that go beyond decent to great, memorable, and most important of all, saleable. Average simply doesn’t cut it.</p>

<p>If we eliminate the totally automatic setting, then, we are left with two choices : aperture priority or shutter priority. The choice between these two may be simpler than you might imagine. Think of it this way. Shutter priority allows you to control the shutter speed. If you are shooting sports or any subject that is moving rapidly <strong>and</strong> you want to freeze the action, select shutter priority. Set your camera to the fastest shutter speed that still allows a recognizable image and the camera takes over the rest. For general sports, you would want a shutter speed of at least 1/250<sup>th</sup> of a second or faster. To stop your daughter’s goalie soccer save, you might want to shoot at 1/500 or even 1/1000 of a second. Ditto for a NASCAR event.</p>

<p>If you shoot landscape and nature scenes, even wildlife, I suggest that you consider shooting in aperture priority. Virtually every landscape professional I know shoots in aperture priority. Let’s see why.</p>

<p>When shooting landscapes, you usually want everything possible to be in focus, from nearby objects to distant mountains. That means you should use smaller apertures, say f11, f16 or even f22. Remember that the larger the number, the smaller the aperture. By aperture we refer to the round opening in the camera lens that allows light in when you press the shutter release button (the interleaved metallic gizmo that opens and shuts to create the aperture is called the diaphragm). As aperture decreases (in other words as it goes from f2.8 to f16, for example, the more individual parts of your scene will be in focus.</p>

<p><a href="http://blog.lesterpickerphoto.com/wp-content/uploads/2010/01/picker-moo-image-42-of-51.jpg"><img class="size-medium wp-image-109" title="Moraine Lake" src="http://blog.lesterpickerphoto.com/wp-content/uploads/2010/01/picker-moo-image-42-of-51.jpg?w=198" alt="" width="198" height="300"></a></p>

<p>If you were to measure how much of the foreground and background is in focus you would be referring to the depth of field of the image. And that’s where knowing how to shoot in aperture priority comes in handy. The rule is this; as the aperture decreases in size, the depth of field increases. Think of squinting. When we squint, we reduce the opening in the diaphragm of our eyes so that the scene appears to be more in focus.</p>

<p>Okay, so how does this knowledge help to create better images? Let’s look at some examples. You want to take a picture of your no doubt good-looking and brilliant child sitting on a park bench. Behind your prodigy is a busy street scene. Cars are whizzing by, trees and flowers clutter the background, and a huge billboard advertising beer (with the requisite buxom cheerleader) is positioned just to the right of your child’s head.</p>

<p><a href="http://blog.lesterpickerphoto.com/wp-content/uploads/2010/01/picker-moo-image-2-of-511.jpg"><img class="size-medium wp-image-113" title="PICKER-Moo image 2 of 51" src="http://blog.lesterpickerphoto.com/wp-content/uploads/2010/01/picker-moo-image-2-of-511.jpg?w=217" alt="" width="217" height="300"></a></p>

<p>If you are shooting in aperture-priority, you would simply “open up the lens” by increasing the aperture setting to f2.8 or 3.5 or 4.0. That would seriously reduce the depth-of-field, meaning that your child’s face would be in focus, but everything in the background would be blurry. In fact, if you can open up the lens to f2.8 it would render the background a soft blur that would force the viewer’s eye to the face rather than the distractions in the background.</p>

<p>On the other hand, suppose you are standing on the South Rim of the Grand Canyon and want a classic shot of the nearby point that sticks out. But you also want to capture the gorge itself and the North Rim. In this case you would set the aperture on f11, f16 or f22. That would increase the depth-of-field and just about everything in your image would be sharp.</p>

<p><a href="http://blog.lesterpickerphoto.com/wp-content/uploads/2010/01/picker-moo-image-22-of-51.jpg"><img class="size-medium wp-image-111" title="Survival" src="http://blog.lesterpickerphoto.com/wp-content/uploads/2010/01/picker-moo-image-22-of-51.jpg?w=199" alt="" width="199" height="300"></a></p>

<p>One final point. You may wonder why the aperture settings are so oddly numbered. The usual complement of f stops in most lenses is: f2.8, f4.0, f5.6, f8.0, f11, f16 and f22. These numbers are actual the product of the formula that calculates the surface area of the camera’s diaphragm opening. Fuggedaboudit. The only important thing to know is that each f-stop successively halves the amount of light entering the lens as you go from f2.8 to f22. Conversely, as you go from f22 to f2.8, the amount of light hitting your camera’s sensor doubles each time you increase one f-stop.</p>

<p>To paraphrase Ansel Adams, photography is nothing more than capturing and manipulating light. If you want to increase the depth-of-field you will be decreasing the amount of light entering the camera. So that means that for you to get a balanced shot you would need to allow the diaphragm to remain open longer. In some cases you may need to leave the shutter open so long you may need to use a tripod to nail that Grand Canyon shot. Usually, most adults can hand-hold a camera up to 1/25<sup>th</sup> of a second without hand-shake that would blur the image. If your camera tells you that at f16 you would need to use a shutter speed of 1/10<sup>th</sup> of a second, do yourself a favor and mount the camera on a tripod (or a Joby, a neat mini-tripod that bends in every conceivable way and is available on the Internet or in camera stores).</p>

<p>So, if you’re currently shooting everything in Automatic, try aperture priority next time you’re out. You’ll gain more creative control over your images and once you get the hang of it I’ll bet you’ll like your images a whole lot more.</p>

		  <div class="entry-content"><p>Here’s a little secret about all professional photographers (and I do mean all). Every one of us is paranoid. Some of us are just more paranoid than others.</p>

<p>Of course what I’m talking about is the pro photographer’s need to back up his or her images in the field. Each of us has our own method of doing so, depending on one’s level of comfort and relationship with God. In any case, backing up is a good idea even if you are a newbie photographer. You certainly don’t want to risk losing your images from your 3-week European family vacation.</p>

<p>Here are the methods I use to back up in the field and at home.</p>

<p><strong><em> In the Field</em></strong></p>

<p><a href="http://blog.lesterpickerphoto.com/wp-content/uploads/2009/06/pixelpocketrocket.jpg"><img class="size-full wp-image-337 " title="pixelpocketrocket" src="http://blog.lesterpickerphoto.com/wp-content/uploads/2009/06/pixelpocketrocket.jpg" alt="" width="192" height="156"></a></p>

<p>First, I carry at least 12 Compact Flash cards for my Nikon cameras, ranging from 8 GB to 16GB each. Rarely do I shoot through all the cards on an assignment, even if I’m gone for two or three weeks (and I shoot RAW only). As I use each card I put it in a nifty case called a Pixel Pocket Rocket (<a href="http://www.thinktankphoto.com">www.thinktankphoto.com</a>), facing backward, so I know it has been used. From that point on, my used cards are either on my person or nestled comfortable in a hotel safe.</p>

<p>Each night, I back up my flash cards to my Aperture software on my 15” MacBook Pro laptop <em><strong>and</strong></em> to a Western Digital (WD) 500GB portable drive. I usually carry two of these drives with me. They are incredibly small, lightweight, durable and inexpensive. Every few days, I also back up my Aperture library to the second WD drive. Backing up to my laptop also gives me an opportunity to review my images on a large screen and to gauge how the assignment is proceeding.</p>

<p><a href="http://blog.lesterpickerphoto.com/wp-content/uploads/2009/06/wdfMP_Essential.jpg"><img class="size-full wp-image-338" title="wdfMP_Essential" src="http://blog.lesterpickerphoto.com/wp-content/uploads/2009/06/wdfMP_Essential.jpg" alt="" width="300" height="300"></a></p>

<p>Paranoid, right? Well, if you’re not convinced yet, listen to this. On the way home, I make sure to carry every backup with me onto the plane (well I sure as hell am not going to trust my livelihood to airport baggage handlers!). However I divvy them up so that if my carry-on rolling camera bag is stolen, I still have one of the WD drives in my pocket and I haven’t lost the entire shoot. If my wife is traveling with me, I might give her another one of the drives to carry on board in her purse. My laptop is in its carrying case. All the original flash cards are in the Pixel Pocket Rocket, safely tucked into the camera bag. Four-way protection, ahh!</p>

<p>When I get home, I have the choice of downloading the originals from the flash cards to my desktop system or transferring the entire shoot from the WD drives or the laptop. In any case, I’m well protected from loss. Once I download the images <strong><em>and</em></strong> backup my office system, then I format my flash cards and the WD drives and delete the images from the laptop. Now I’m ready for my next photo shoot.</p>

<p><strong><em> At Home</em></strong></p>

<p>My home office involves a MacPro system. My Aperture library resides on a large hard drive. Each night it is automatically backed up onto another hard drive and once a week the entire system is backed up onto a third hard drive.</p>

<p>But, what about fire, flood or pestilence? Good question. I cover that base by keeping two, 2-TB backup drives in a safe deposit box at my bank, which is exactly one block from me. On one of the first days of every month I retrieve those drives. I back up the entire system on one and just my Aperture library on the other.</p>

<p>Colleagues of mine have variations on this theme. Several make an annual back up of all their images shot during that year and file that backup offsite. Others make permanent backups of each trip or assignment onto a growing stack of WD drives. As the saying goes, God is good, but you’d better have a backup plan.</p>

		  <div class="entry-content"><p>One of the thorniest challenges for professional and advanced amateur photographers alike is packing for a trip. Every year the situation seems to worsen. Airlines are not only more restrictive than ever, they are also arbitrary and capricious. One time I’ll be let through and on a different leg of the same trip I’ll be stopped and told I cannot take my bag onto the plane. Or I’ll be in a remote location where a bush pilot will severely limit my carry-on bag.</p>

<p>One not-so-humorous incident (at the time) happened on an Air Canada flight to Yukon Territory. I was told my wheel-on camera bag was too heavy. I’m used to that by now, so I always stuff my camera vest into the outside pocket of my bag. With a line of impatient people behind me, I unloaded a few heavy lenses and stuffed them into my vest pockets and strung my DSLR with a 70-200 attached around my neck. The ticket counter woman was pissed, but she reluctantly accepted defeat.</p>

<p>Off I went to the gate. I was still 90 minutes early, so I repacked all my equipment back into my bag. When they finally called my row, I wheeled up to board. Then I saw her! The ticket agent at the gate, you guessed it, was the same woman who had been at the counter. She pulled me aside and actually made me do the whole unpacking shtick all over again! Once aboard some unhappy fliers watched me repack again as they waited to pass up the aisle.</p>

<p>As an aside I have to tell you that I weigh 163 pounds soaking wet. With my wheel-on, I would clock in at under 200, max. The man who sat next to me weighed a conservative 240-260 pounds AND he carried a computer bag AND an overnighter. Does this airline weight regulation make any sense… at all?</p>

<p>Anyway, what is a serious photographer to do? First a deep, dark secret. I probably have more photo bags in my office than my wife has pocketbooks! Seriously, over the years I have accumulated more over-the-shoulder, around-the-waist, wheeling, backpacking and sling photography bags than Imelda Marcus has shoes. But, if my wife is reading this, I swear I need them all, Hon!</p>

<p>I very regularly use the following:</p>

<ul>
<li><em><strong>Think Tank Airport International V2.0 Rolling Bag
</strong> </em></li>
    <li><em><strong>Think Tank Rotation 360 backpack</strong></em></li>
    <li><em><strong>Think Tank Speed Demon
</strong> </em></li>
    <li><em><strong>Think Tank Speed Freak
</strong> </em></li>
    <li><em><strong>Think Tank Airport Check-In
</strong> </em></li>
    <li><em><strong>Lowe Pro Nature Trekker</strong></em></li>
</ul>


<p><a href="http://blog.lesterpickerphoto.com/wp-content/uploads/2009/05/rotation-360-1.jpg"><img class="size-medium wp-image-334" title="rotation-360--1" src="http://blog.lesterpickerphoto.com/wp-content/uploads/2009/05/rotation-360-1-300x192.jpg" alt="" width="300" height="192"></a></p>

<p>Along with these basics, I have an assortment of dedicated side packs, pouches and lens cases that fasten to the sides of the bags.</p>

<p>Obviously, I single-handedly keep Think Tank’s business in the black. But, although their products are expensive, to me they are worth every penny. They are incredibly rugged and ingeniously well thought out, probably because their designers are also professional photographers. They also have some of the best security features in the industry. Go to <a href="http://www.thinktankphoto.com">www.thinktankphoto.com</a> for more info. While at their site, be sure to download a copy of their free helpful publication on how to travel with camera equipment and tips on how to get through airport security.</p>

<p>My Lowepro (<a href="http://www.lowepro.com">www.lowepro.com</a>) is my go-to bag for backpacking into rough terrain, where I may have to bring several days of equipment. It never ceases to amaze me how much cra… I mean, gear I can pack into that thing. I usually add a side pouch for water and another for snacks.</p>

<p>I always pack my tripod in my checked luggage and pad it well. Since I exclusively use rugged Eagle Creek luggage (<a href="http://www.eaglecreek.com">www.eaglecreek.com</a>), with their roomy interiors, I always take one of my Think Tank waist packs with me, place it in the luggage and pack it tight with my clothes and some other camera accessories. Then, when I get to my photo location, I have a daypack to use as needed.</p>

<p>Let me know your photo equipment travel tips. In a later blog I’ll share with you what I carry in my backpack for remote shooting.</p>

<p>By shooting tight, I’m referring to zooming in on the subject so that you remove distracting elements and instead highlight its most salient feature(s). Take the photo below as an example. I shot it on one of my trips to the Galapagos Islands off the coast of Ecuador. In and of itself the photo is ‘okay.’ It’s a textbook example of the giant Galapagos tortoise, the same ones documented by Charles Darwin in the 19<sup>th</sup> century. Therein lies the problem with the image. Like a textbook, it’s b-o-r-i-n-g. It would be fine for a biology text, but it lacks punch. Zero drama.</p>

<p>Now take a look at this image, shot the same day. See the difference? Notice the emotional impact?</p>

<p><img class="aligncenter size-medium wp-image-30" title="Galapagos Tortoise-tight" src="http://blog.lesterpickerphoto.com/wp-content/uploads/2009/05/galapagos-tortoise-tight.jpg?w=300" alt="Galapagos Tortoise-tight" width="300" height="200"><img class="size-medium wp-image-31 alignright" style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;" title="Nazca Booby with Chick-wide" src="http://blog.lesterpickerphoto.com/wp-content/uploads/2009/05/nazca-booby-with-chick-wide.jpg?w=300" alt="Nazca Booby with Chick-wide" width="300" height="194"></p>

<p>The same concept holds true for the following images. The Nazca Booby was photographed in the Galapagos and everyone else I was with photographed the mother and bird as a whole, as I initially did. Some even shot the scene wide angle to get in the rocks and water in the background, thereby making it hard t see the mother and chick at all. I managed to squeeze off a few telephoto shots of the baby alone and I like the effect (hopefully my editors will, too).</p>

<p><img class="aligncenter size-medium wp-image-32" title="Nazca Booby with Chick-tight" src="http://blog.lesterpickerphoto.com/wp-content/uploads/2009/05/nazca-booby-with-chick-tight.jpg?w=300" alt="Nazca Booby with Chick-tight" width="300" height="200"><img class="size-medium wp-image-33 alignleft" style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;" title="amusement park-wide" src="http://blog.lesterpickerphoto.com/wp-content/uploads/2009/05/amusement-park-wide.jpg?w=200" alt="amusement park-wide" width="200" height="300"></p>

<p>This next series really show two images with entirely different effects. However, I just wanted to show how shooting tight can result in creative applications that may not be immediately apparent in the wider image. I took this initial shot for a series on amusement parks. This was taken at Salem Willows in Massachusetts.</p>

<p>The tight rendition is the stuff of kids’ nightmares, a bas relief of Chucky.</p>

<p><img class="aligncenter size-medium wp-image-34" title="amusement park-tight" src="http://blog.lesterpickerphoto.com/wp-content/uploads/2009/05/amusement-park-tight.jpg?w=300" alt="amusement park-tight" width="300" height="200"></p>

<p>Finally, shooting tight works wonders for people shots, but I’ll leave that topic for another day.</p>

		  <div class="entry-content"><p><strong>I </strong>don’t mean to be sarcastic… no, I take that back. I do mean to be sarcastic. Here goes. There is no rule that says you must hold your camera at eye level, in a standing position, with the camera in landscape orientation every time. There, I said it!</p>

<p>As a professional photographer and former editor, I figure that about 98% of all photos taken by amateurs are in landscape orientation. That, in itself, would not be so bad. But when you couple that with the dreaded eye-level perspective, the results are often dull and uninteresting, true snapshots rather than exciting photographs.</p>

<p>If you’re primarily into snapshots, that’s fine. There’s nothing like a snapshot of the Pyramids (if you can get one without shops and hawkers that encroach ever closer every year) or the husband standing at the rim of the Grand Canyon (“Go ahead, Honey, keep backing up… a few more steps…”). But to get truly unique images, to move beyond snapshots to true photographs, try this technique of the pros; Shoot High and Shoot Low.</p>

<p><img class="size-medium wp-image-40 alignleft" style="border: 0 initial initial; margin: 0 15px;" title="Navajo Tree and Cliff" src="http://blog.lesterpickerphoto.com/wp-content/uploads/2009/05/navajotreerootcliff3.jpg?w=199" alt="Navajo Tree and Cliff" width="199" height="300"><h3>Change Your Perspective</h3>
The main take-away to this tip is to move away from what I call the plane of conformity. Since most people take a picture standing up, try photographing from a crouched position or from your knees. I took the photo below on Navajo land in Utah. While others stood around photographing this interesting tree, I laid on my stomach and shot this from root level. Maybe the shot works for you and maybe it doesn’t. Art, after all, is subjective. But the image is not the typical one you would see associated with this particular view. To my eyes the image benefits from the down-low perspective.</p>

<p><img class="size-medium wp-image-42 alignright" style="margin-left: 15px; margin-right: 15px;" title="hawaiiphilodendronleaves" src="http://blog.lesterpickerphoto.com/wp-content/uploads/2009/05/hawaiiphilodendronleaves1.jpg?w=300" alt="hawaiiphilodendronleaves" width="300" height="224"></p>

<p>In a similar vein, my wife and I were hiking Hawaii’s spectacular Napali Coast on the island of Kauai. At an overpass, everyone else on the trail took a photo of one particular scenic view. Each person would approach the lookout, bring the camera up to their eye and shoot the very same shot. Again, there’s nothing wrong with that, since you’ve captured that memory forever. But, whenever I see people taking the same exact photo, I turn around and look the other way. I look up, I look down. In this case, I spotted the sun backlighting these philodendron leaves, high above my head.</p>

<p><img class="size-medium wp-image-43 alignleft" style="margin-left: 15px; margin-right: 15px;" title="galapagossealionpups" src="http://blog.lesterpickerphoto.com/wp-content/uploads/2009/05/galapagossealionpups1.jpg?w=300" alt="galapagossealionpups" width="300" height="200"><h3>Get Down!</h3>
For this close-up of sea lion pups playing in the Galapagos, I laid down in the sand for twenty minutes, shooting away while the pups frolicked. Sure my elbows and clothes got wet, but I came away with a series of shots I wanted.</p>

<p><img class="size-medium wp-image-44 alignright" style="margin-left: 15px; margin-right: 15px;" title="marshgrassesatdawn" src="http://blog.lesterpickerphoto.com/wp-content/uploads/2009/05/marshgrassesatdawn1.jpg?w=300" alt="marshgrassesatdawn" width="300" height="198"></p>

<p>A similar thing happened with this shot of marsh grasses. I had to lay down on the boardwalk of a nature center at sunrise to capture this image.</p>

<p><img class="size-medium wp-image-45 alignleft" style="margin: 0 15px;" title="Egypt-Marbles" src="http://blog.lesterpickerphoto.com/wp-content/uploads/2009/05/egypt-marbles1.jpg?w=175" alt="Egypt-Marbles" width="200" height="325"></p>

<p>Here’s another Shoot High-Shoot Low tip. When photographing kids, get down to their level. I took this shot of a boy playing marbles in Luxor, Egypt. Had I stood up and shot eye level, the shot would have lost out. By crouching down and pointing my camera up at the boy, I got a marble-ous perspective on the game (ok, I never said I was an expert punner).</p>

<p>So, next time you&#8217;re out photographing, be bold, be adventurous. Shoot High-Shoot Low. Heck, just shoot. I think you’ll be happy with your results.</p>

		  <div class="entry-content"><p>Okay, I’ll admit it. I’m a senior photographer. Not senior as in jobsite seniority. I’m old. Maybe even ancient (well, 60 no longer seems as old as it did when I was thirty).</p>

<p>For us photo geezers, I offer the following: my favorite accessories that I employ in the field, whether I’m shooting landscapes in Ecuador or wildlife in Africa. I&#8217;m a professional photographer, so use or modify these suggestions to suit your photographic needs. And, send in your own suggestions which I will post on my site and credit to your experience and wisdom.</p>

<p><strong><a href="http://blog.lesterpickerphoto.com/wp-content/uploads/2009/05/hravthumb1.gif"><img class="alignright size-medium wp-image-247" title="hrav(thumb)" src="http://blog.lesterpickerphoto.com/wp-content/uploads/2009/05/hravthumb1-277x300.gif" alt="" width="277" height="300"></a>Right Angle Viewer (RAV)</strong>. As far as I’m concerned this is a must for the over-fifty photographer. You attach the RAV to your viewfinder and voila!, you don’t have to lay on your stomach to get a shot of that rare flower. RAVs rotate so that you can use them in landscape or portrait mode. They’re great to use with a tripod when photographing wildflowers or insects. Tip: since the RAV optics do not factor into the actual photo (that’s what the lens mounted on the front of the camera is for), you don’t need to buy the one made by your camera manufacturer. You can get one for half the price from secondary manufacturers. My favorite is <a href="http://www.hoodman.com">www.hoodman.com</a>.</p>

<p><strong>Knee Pads</strong>. Don’t laugh, knee pads are the greatest invention since sliced bread for seniors. Try kneeling for ten minutes photographing those cute sea lions in the Galapagos. The lava rocks will gnaw at your kneecaps and you’ll feel the stress on your knees for days. Sure I look like a dork, but if I’m comfortable in the field, I usually bring home the goods. Try on pairs at Home Depot or Lowes.</p>

<p><strong>Photo Glove</strong>s. These are lightweight, rubber-coated gloves that keep bulk to a minimum and grip strength at a maximum. You can’t go wrong with the ones made by LowePro.</p>

<p><strong>Plastic Reading Glasse</strong>s. In the field I use cheap plastic frames with polycarbonate lenses, less than $20 at the local drugstore. I always carry an extra pair with me, since without reading glasses I can’t read a damned thing on my LCD screen.</p>

<p><strong>Tripod</strong>. I hate to admit it, but aging has taken its toll on my joints. I used to be able to handhold a 70-200mm lens all day and still get sharp images at 1/50 of a second at twilight. No more. Now my tripod is my #1 photo tool. Tip: buy one of the carbon fiber tripods for their reduced weight. Then put foam pads on the upper leg sections so you can carry it balanced on your shoulder without pain.</p>

<p><strong>Diopter adjustment</strong>. Lots of folks either forget or don’t know that you can adjust the diopter setting on most mid- to high-end DSLR cameras to customize it for your eyesight. Thebest way to use it is to set your camera on a tripod and autofocus on a book jacket propped up on a table. Take the shot and be sure that the focus is tack sharp. Now look through the viewfinder without changing any setting. If the book does not look tack sharp to your eyes, adjust the diopter wheel until the image appears perfectly sharp to you.</p>

<p><strong>Your suggestions, please</strong>… I welcome suggestions from other senior photographers out there. Please let me know what you use to make photographing easier for you. Until then, use sunscreen and drink lots of water (ibuprofen helps, too!).</p>

		  <div class="entry-content"><p><img class="alignleft size-thumbnail wp-image-10" style="margin: 0 15px;" title="Colorado river3" src="http://blog.lesterpickerphoto.com/wp-content/uploads/2009/05/colorado-river3.jpg?w=100" alt="Colorado river3" width="175" height="300"></p>

<p>If there is one question that amateurs most often ask about my images, it’s: “How do you get those clouds to pop out so much?” The alternative question is how I get the blue skies to render so… well, blue.</p>

<h3>Use a Polarizing Filter</h3>


<p>The short answer is that I use a polarizing filter probably 80% of the time when I’m shooting outdoors during the daytime. It’s the not-so-secret ingredient that pros use all the time because our editors, and people who buy our images for their home or office, want to view landscapes where the colors are nicely saturated and clouds and skies are delineated.</p>

<p>A polarizing filter works by taking scattered light and filtering it so that you have more parallel rays getting through to the camera’s sensor (or film, if you are still using a film camera). You don’t need to know all the physics, but the effect is powerful. See the accompanying photos that I took on a recent trip down the Colorado River and you’ll get an idea of how a polarizer can improve your photos.</p>

<p><img class="size-thumbnail wp-image-12 alignright" style="margin: 0 15px;" title="Colorado river6" src="http://blog.lesterpickerphoto.com/wp-content/uploads/2009/05/colorado-river6.jpg?w=150" alt="Colorado river6" width="300" height="175"></p>

<p>If you are willing to invest in a polarizer, make sure you buy what is known as a circular polarizer. A circular polarizer consists of two pieces of glass that rotate relative to each other. You can dial in just the right amount of polarization to suit your creative vision. Polarizers also cut through some of the haze that ruins images on hot, humid days. Polarizers can also help make reflections more prominent.</p>

<h3>Ins and Outs of Polarizers</h3>


<p>Like any photographic accessory, polarizers have limitations. Due to the physics of light, they are most effective when they point 90 degrees away from the sun. As yopu face toward or directly away from the sun, they are pretty iseless. And they have drawbacks. First, they are expensive. A good one for a DSLR will set you back at least $100 and can go up to $200. They also reduce light transmission by one or two stops, which can either help you capture that special image (think blurred water over a waterfall) or hinder your efforts. They also add a certain hassle factor, since there will be times when you are out shooting and as light conditions change you will invariably have to be screwing the filter on or off.</p>

<p><img class="alignright size-thumbnail wp-image-14" style="margin: 0 15px;" title="hoya-cir" src="http://blog.lesterpickerphoto.com/wp-content/uploads/2009/05/hoya-cir.jpg?w=150" alt="hoya-cir" width="150" height="100"></p>

<p>Every DSLR can accommodate polarizers, since the front of lenses for DSLRs have a screw thread. Unfortunately, due to the sheer variety of point-and-shoot cameras, few manufacturers make polarizing filters for them. In fact, a good polarizer could conceivably cost more than an inexpensive or even a moderately priced point-and-shoot. But even if your point-and-shoot does not accommodate screw-on polarizers, the good news is you can still use one. A cool feature of a polarizer is that you can hold it up to your eye and rotate the outer glass and you will see the effects immediately. Now, without changing the relative position of the polarizer, just hold it right up to your lens, point and shoot. I guarantee you will see dramatic improvements in your landscapes!</p>
