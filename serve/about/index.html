<h3>Les Picker</h3>

<p>Les Picker has been photographing since the age of 11, when his father, an accomplished amateur photographer, bought him his first 35mm SLR film camera (a Minolta, btw). Les has since photographed for National Geographic Society publications and many other consumer and corporate magazines and newspapers. He has had more than 600 published articles in major national publications. He was a monthly columnist and features contributor to Oceans Magazine and a weekly columnist, Op-Ed contributor and features travel writer and photographer for The Baltimore Sun. Les shoots Hasselblad and Nikon equipment and is a member of Nikon Professional Services, Hasselblad Professionals, as well as the American Society of Journalists and Authors.</p>

<p>Two characteristics shape Les’ photography; passion and inquisitiveness. Since an early age Les has been interested in the natural world and in other cultures. He has an earned doctorate in environmental affairs (winter ecology), which he believes helps inform his landscape and wildlife photography. His interest in other cultures draws him frequently to exotic locales.</p>

<p>Les has cruised on a nuclear attack submarine deep in the Pacific Ocean and has climbed the highest peak in the Pyrenes. He has withstood -50F in the Arctic and tolerated 120F living with a Bedouin tribe in the Eastern desert of Egypt. He was nearly bitten by a sea lion in the Galapagos (never stand between a mother and her pup!) and was chased by a 16-foot alligator in South Africa.</p>

<p>Les was awarded the top prize in the prestigious Canada Northern Lights Award for 2011.</p>

<p>“I feel blessed to be able to write and photograph for a living,” Les says. “If my photographs help people better appreciate our natural world – and its fragility – then I feel I have accomplished a worthy life goal.”</p>
