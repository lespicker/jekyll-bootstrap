  <div class="entry-content"><p>Bob, my associate, and I were taking a lunch break from testing print profiles for <a href="http://www.museofineart.com">Museo Fine Art papers</a> for our <a href="http://www.lesterpickerphoto.com/workshops/upcoming-workshops.html">upcoming workshop this fall in Maine</a>. We got into a discussion about capturing images of local and indigenous people when traveling. It&#8217;s one of those infrequent times that Bob and I completely agreed about an issue that has many times gotten us into a rage, as it turns out.</p>

<p>The conversation started out innocently enough, as we discussed what lenses we prefer to capture people. Bob prefers a 50mm and he has a collection of them that rivals anyone&#8217;s. As for me, I&#8217;m eclectic, preferring a super wide angle (my Nikkor 14-24 or 17-35) in some circumstances and my Nikkor 24-70 in most others. On occasion I have even used my Nikkor 70-200 when I can&#8217;t get close to my subject, perhaps while they are involved in a native ceremony or other activity.</p>

<p><a href="http://blog.lesterpickerphoto.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/06/LAP2568.jpg"><img class="size-medium wp-image-2824" title="_LAP2568" src="http://blog.lesterpickerphoto.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/06/LAP2568-200x300.jpg" alt="" width="200" height="300"></a></p>

<p> </p>

<h3>Tools of Ignorance</h3>


<p>That conversation led us into the methods that photographers use to capture travel portraits. The behavior that drives us up a wall are those photographers who try to sneakily capture people serruptitiously, using telephoto lenses. Then there are the drive-by-shooting artists who stick a camera into an unsuspecting local&#8217;s face and snap away, sometimes over their objections.</p>

<p>Do these people realize how crude they are being? Do they understand how their selfish behavior ruins the opportunity for photographers who follow in their wake? Is snagging the image so important they are obviously willing to throw ethical and humane considerations out the window? In their hands, photographic equipment becomes tools of ignorance.</p>

<h3>It&#8217;s About Time… and Relationships</h3>


<p>If there is one thing I try to emphasize with travel photography that involves people, it&#8217;s that it takes time. It&#8217;s not just about rushing from here to there to see this site or that. The best travel experiences of my life involve taking the time to talk to a person, find out who they are, talk about family, show the subject how much you enjoy their country.</p>

<p> </p>

<p><a href="http://blog.lesterpickerphoto.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/06/2006-11-ecuador1746.jpg"><img class="size-medium wp-image-2825" title="Winning Smile" src="http://blog.lesterpickerphoto.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/06/2006-11-ecuador1746-200x300.jpg" alt="" width="200" height="300"></a></p>

<p> </p>

<p>Taking the time to understand your subject builds relationship and that invariably leads to better photographs. When you get to know your subjects, even if only a tad bit more than when you first came upon them, you success rate for capturing their &#8220;essence&#8221; will improve markedly. It will also increase the rate at which people agree to have you photograph them. Some of the people I have photographed I have become friends with to this day.</p>

<p> </p>

<p><a href="http://blog.lesterpickerphoto.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/06/abdelzahersister2_edited-1.jpg"><img class="size-medium wp-image-2826" title="Bedouin Mother" src="http://blog.lesterpickerphoto.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/06/abdelzahersister2_edited-1-239x300.jpg" alt="" width="239" height="300"></a></p>

<p> </p>

<p>In a previous blog on <a href="http://blog.lesterpickerphoto.com/2010/02/13/photographing-people/">tips to create better people pictures</a>, I alluded to the time and relationship issues, but I wanted to be a bit more forceful about it here. So, please, if you photograph people surreptitiously, rethink that approach. And if you are the kind that insultingly sticks a camera in a foreigner&#8217;s face, please think of how arrogant that action is and commit to change. In the end you&#8217;ll be helping yourself and your fellow photographers. And, thanks.</p>

<p>PS: If you are serious about photographing people while traveling, try my e-book on the topic:<a href="http://shop.lesterpickerphoto.com/page/102"><strong><em> The Photographer&#8217;s Eye: People</em></strong></a>, available at <a href="http://shop.lesterpickerphoto.com/">my store</a>. Hope you enjoy it!</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>As a professional landscape, wildlife and travel photographer, I eagerly awaited the arrival of my <a href="http://www.gigapan.com">Gigapan Epic Pro</a> test unit. I had been reading a lot of press about this techno-marvel, and was especially impressed by George Lepp’s experience. George is a veteran photographer who I admire.</p>

<p>I should also mention that here at <a href="http://www.lesterpickerphoto.com">Les Picker Fine Art Photography</a> we produce some very large images for my clients. Nowadays a 30”x40” print is average size for us. We have done murals for clients that range from 17-feet wide and ten feet tall to <a href="http://blog.lesterpickerphoto.com/2012/09/17/wallpaper-mural/">30-feet x 10-feet</a> and <a href="http://blog.lesterpickerphoto.com/2012/11/16/a-les-picker-fine-art-installation/">I’ve blogged about those installations before</a>. To create eye-popping oversized prints pixel density is critical. Blowing up a 12-megapixel image just can’t cut it. Even my 36-megapixel Nikon D800 would be taxed when creating an 8-foot print. Enter Gigapan.</p>

<p> </p>

<h3>Gigapan</h3>


<p>Gigapan was initially created by scientists at NASA and Carnegie Mellon University in Pittsburgh to take ultra-high resolution images for applications such as the lunar and Mars rovers. The theory behind it is that you photograph a scene in pieces, each with a telephoto lens, you then piece the image together and thereby get absolutely huge pixel counts with tons of definition in the resulting image. Once the photo system was deployed, they commercialized it and created the Gigapan system for our non-robotic arms.</p>

<p><a href="http://blog.lesterpickerphoto.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/06/DSC_1125.jpg"><img class="size-medium wp-image-2811" title="DSC_1125" src="http://blog.lesterpickerphoto.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/06/DSC_1125-200x300.jpg" alt="" width="200" height="300"></a></p>

<p> </p>

<p>So when my test unit arrived from Gigapan, I unboxed it, quickly tested it on my deck and immediately loaded it into a separate backpack to take with me to Colorado’s most wondrous Garden of the Gods to put it through its paces. The adventure had begun.</p>

<p> </p>

<p><a href="http://blog.lesterpickerphoto.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/06/DSC_7575-Panorama.jpg"><img class="size-medium wp-image-2810" title="DSC_7575 Panorama" src="http://blog.lesterpickerphoto.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/06/DSC_7575-Panorama-300x94.jpg" alt="" width="300" height="94"></a></p>

<h3></h3>


<h3>Off, But Not Running</h3>


<p>The first thing I have to report is that the Gigapan is a beast to carry. I am a “senior” photographer, but I still hike all day in mountainous terrain with 30 pounds of gear on my back. I simply could not imagine hauling a Gigapan in addition. It is both bulky and heavy, especially since you will need to carry at least two batteries. Gigapan even sells a tailored backpack to house the unit, but I tried to make do with a single, large LowePro Trekker AW400 (<a href="http://blog.lesterpickerphoto.com/2011/12/07/the-lowepro-trekker-aw400%E2%80%A6-a-backpack-on-steroids/">click here</a> for my review of that pack).</p>

<p>That’s why I field tested it at the Garden of the Gods, since I knew I could drive to various locations there and put it to the test only yards from my rental car.</p>

<p>As it turned out, my first day of shooting was a breeze, primarily because there were no breezes, but I’ll get to that later. The initial setup of the day was laborious. The unit has to be attached to a sturdy tripod (I use a Gitzo 3541) and various parts must be assembled. Then the camera and lens has to be mounted. You also must also have pre-determined your parallax (nodal) point in order to mount the camera properly to capture good panos. I used a Nikon D800 for the tests, with a 70-200mm or a 200-400mm Nikkor lens attached. The tripod must also be leveled.</p>

<h3></h3>


<h3>Ready, Set, Set, Set, Go!</h3>


<p>Once mounted, the menu setup is reasonably simple. The Gigapan base has a screen that walks you through the menu items in sequence. Once that is done, you simply move the camera to the upper right and let the camera know that is where you would like the pano to start. Then you move it to the lower right using its mechanical movements to tell it where you want the pano to end. The unit then calculates how many images are needed to capture the scene, given the lens and focal length you’ve specified during menu setup. Press a button and VOILA! The camera/lens automagically points to the upper left of the scene, clicks, then moves to the next spot in the sequence, click, until it ends on the bottom right.</p>

<p>There are even ways to tweak your setup. For example, if you want to minimize camera shake, you can program your camera for mirror lock-up and Gigapan will adjust. You can even do a series of bracketed exposures at each capture station (although the directions I got with the unit were unclear on how to do this… you have to have mirror-up set on both the camera and the Gigapan). Also, bracketing on the D800 is limited by Nikon to 1 EV increments, meaning that you will need to take 5 excruciatingly slow captures to get 2 EV increments.</p>

<p>The results of a Gigapan session can be amazing, showing detail you can hardly imagine. Witness this image I took at Garden of the Gods using 63 separate exposures. I imported the images into Lightroom 4, exported them as TIFFs to PTGUI which stitched them together easily, then imported the resulting TIFF back into LR4. A couple of adjustment tweaks later and here it is.</p>

<p><a href="http://blog.lesterpickerphoto.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/06/pano.jpg"><img class="size-medium wp-image-2812" title="pano" src="http://blog.lesterpickerphoto.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/06/pano-300x88.jpg" alt="" width="300" height="88"></a></p>

<p> </p>

<h3>The Rest of the Story</h3>


<p>So why is it that I returned the unit to Gigpan after the trial and won’t be purchasing one, at least not now? The simple answer is that I simply cannot incorporate it into my fieldwork. It is that bulky and heavy. I work alone and sometimes hike for 10 hours a day in rugged terrain. Even on my recent trip to Italy I would not consider schlepping it along. However, if you are the type of photographer who plans to drive to your destinations, the bulk and weight objection may not be pertinent.</p>

<p>Unfortunately, there are a few other issues that made me decide against the Gigapan. First, the build quality is not what I expected. The bracket that holds the camera, for example, is flimsier than it should be, especially when mounting a DSLR with a 200-400 zoom. In fact, Really Right Stuff sells a replacement bracket for the Gigapan that is far sturdier, but also costly, adding $140-$270 to the Gigapan Epic Pro’s $895 price tag.</p>

<p>This brings up my next issue with the Gigapan unit. It is not stable enough in operation for pro-quality results in some environmental situations. With a DSLR and 200-400 mounted, the camera/lens shakes for 4-6 seconds after it comes to a stop. Gigapan builds in a “solution” to handle that. You can dial in a delay of as many seconds as you need to allow the setup to stabilize. Unfortunately, that brings up the next objection that I have to the process. Think of it; if you build in the stabilizing delay and a mirror-lockup delay and the movement from position to position delay, one 63-image pano can take 10-15 or more minutes to complete! That’s long enough for the lighting and clouds to change radically. That happened to me several times, which means that you have an impossible post-processing job to open shadows or tone down blown highlights.</p>

<p>Further complicating this scenario is that the Gigapan is virtually useless in even moderate winds. The unit acts like a sail and in my experience the camera never stopped shaking even after the 6-second delay, making all of my panos that second day completely unusable. I hung my 30-pound backpack on the tripod, and it helped only slightly.</p>

<p>Finally, the battery, while quite big and heavy, does not last long with the setup I had. In Gigapan’s defense it takes a lot of power to manipulate a Nikon D800 and monster 200-400 lens. But I had to carry two very heavy batteries to get through even half a day’s shoot.</p>

<p> </p>

<h3>Final Thoughts</h3>


<p>In the final analysis, I feel as if I can do as good a job using mechanical tools for my panos, like the Really Right Stuff pano equipment, even for multi-row captures. I would surely capture the pano far faster so as not to miss a once-in-a-lifetime lighting opportunity.  In fact I shot the following panos on the Gigapan and then did the same with my RRS setup in ¼ the time. The images here are the ones I took with my RRS setup or my 24mm tilt-shift.</p>

<p> </p>

<p>Despite my misgivings- and I remind you that this review is only one person’s opinion-  the Gigapan Epic Pro is a lot of fun to operate and it certainly draws a crowd. For me that’s the kiss of death, since one of the prime reasons I do landscape/nature photography is for the solitude that allows me to appreciate the beauty that surrounds me and focus on the tasks at hand. But I can see that Gigapan has wide appeal (they’ve sold a bunch of these babies) to those who can appreciate its merits and can deal with the issues I raised in this review.</p>

<p>I do think that Gigapan will continue to develop the product and I can see a time when my calculus will change in favor of Gigapan. But, until then, I plan to stick with my tested and true method of capturing panos. In fact, I&#8217;ve already done two blogs on the topic (<a href="http://blog.lesterpickerphoto.com/2012/08/21/panoramas-nail-your-nodal-points/">Part 1</a> and <a href="http://blog.lesterpickerphoto.com/2012/09/02/panoramas-part-2-how-i-do-it/">Part 2</a>) and I’ll plan to do more how-to blogs.</p>

<p>As always, I welcome comments, divergent opinions and suggestions.</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>I just returned from a 30-day photo excursion to Italy, Sicily, the Egadi Islands and Malta, a trip that caused me not a small amount of angst before we left. That’s because I usually lug around some 30-40 pounds (14-18 kg) of equipment with me on my landscape adventures, including a Gitzo 3541 tripod with a Really Right Stuff ballhead that alone clocks in at 8 pounds! I needed some real neck and back relief!</p>

<p>Enter the 4-pound (1.8 kg) <a href="http://www.mefoto.com/">MeFoto tripod</a>, complete with ballhead, that I had come across while doing some research. Europe is not exactly the best place to lug around a bulky tripod, due to the incessant crowds and narrow spaces. I needed something light and very portable.</p>

<p><a href="http://blog.lesterpickerphoto.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/06/DSC_1088.jpg"><img class="alignnone size-medium wp-image-2802" title="DSC_1088" src="http://blog.lesterpickerphoto.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/06/DSC_1088-300x200.jpg" alt="" width="300" height="200"></a></p>

<p>Me Foto makes three variants of its uber-portable tripods. I chose the heaviest of the lot- the Globetrotter- because I am a bug for stability.  Even so the MeFoto is not designed to be in the same league with the Gitzo 3541, but as you’ll see I found it exceptionally versatile, easy to carry, and made of quality materials that continually amazed me.</p>

<p> </p>

<h3>What’s Included</h3>


<p> </p>

<p>The MeFoto comes with rubber tips and a rugged carry case that includes a concealed zipper pouch, and an adjustable carry strap. In that pouch the company includes a set of metal spikes for use in sand, an Allen wrench, and an instruction booklet. Also included is a bracket to attach to your camera so it fits the Arca-Swiss ballhead attachment on the tripod. All of my Really Right Stuff brackets fit the MeFoto ballhead perfectly. There is also a spring-loaded hook at the bottom of the center column so that you can add mass when the wind is blowing. In fact I used that hook throughout my trip due to bad weather in Europe in May, 2013. I attached a carabineer to my bag and clipped it to the hook in less than a second. The tripod also includes a rubberized upper leg column on one of the legs, making carrying it a breeze.</p>

<p><a href="http://blog.lesterpickerphoto.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/06/DSC_1093.jpg"><img class="alignnone size-medium wp-image-2803" title="DSC_1093" src="http://blog.lesterpickerphoto.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/06/DSC_1093-300x200.jpg" alt="" width="300" height="200"></a></p>

<p>One ingenious feature of the MeFoto is that one of the legs (the one with the rubberized section) unscrews from the tripod and attaches to the removable center column to create a monopod! It’s like getting two critical pieces of equipment in one.</p>

<p>The machining tolerances on the tripod mechanisms are excellent, in my non-engineering opinion. Legs extend and collapse smoothly with just a quarter-turn of the knurled, rubberized twist locks. The head clamps easily and it firmly held my Nikon D800 with 70-200 f2.8 lens and 1.4 extender. The pan adjustment moves smoothly.</p>

<p> </p>

<p><a href="http://blog.lesterpickerphoto.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/06/DSC_1099.jpg"><img class="alignnone size-medium wp-image-2804" title="DSC_1099" src="http://blog.lesterpickerphoto.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/06/DSC_1099-300x200.jpg" alt="" width="300" height="200"></a></p>

<p> </p>

<h3>Field Test</h3>


<p> </p>

<p>I am a bug for field-testing equipment under real-world conditions. In this respect the MeFoto exceeded my expectations.</p>

<p> </p>

<p>It is so light to carry compared to my usual setup, I found myself smiling most of the time. Setup was quick and easy. The tripod is so small you won’t find yourself ramming it into people on crowded, narrow European streets.</p>

<p> </p>

<p>My only reservation is the price. My larger unit costs $369. However, I would happily pay that again, given how functional it proved to be on my trip. Of course, I would not choose to take it along on my wildlife or landscape adventures, but this wonderful piece of equipment has won a favored place in my photo gear.</p>

<p> </p>

<p>If you have any further questions about the tripod, feel free to ask.</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>I have owned an <a href="http://www.thinktankphoto.com/products/urban-disguise-50-v2.aspx">Urban Disguise 50 (Version 2.0)</a> camera bag for two years now and have never done a review of it. Frankly, I own far too many camera bags, particularly from <a href="http://www.thinktankphoto.com/">Think Tank</a> Photo, so much so that I’m afraid my camera friends will begin to call me Imelda. But as I’ve gotten older I find that the right bag can prevent many of the aches and pains that we older photographers are prone to get.</p>

<p>Those who follow my reviews know that I do not cover the technical details such as measurements, materials and speed ratings, unless those items directly pertain to how the item works in the field. Those stats are commonly available online at lab review sites or at the manufacturer’s site. What I do is review items I buy and use as a pro out in the field.</p>

<h3>The Pros</h3>


<p>The UD 50 is a terrific bag for its intended use, which is to carry photo equipment around with you while touring in a city or town. It is not intended for landscape or wildlife photographers and, as I’ll explain later, for extended use even in cities, at least in my opinion.</p>

<p>The bag is extremely rugged and, as with all Think Tank products, very thoughtfully designed for serious amateurs and pros. At $199.75 it cost more than most bags because of those characteristics. Every stitch is durable. An abundance of pockets makes organization a cinch.</p>

<p>The provided over-the-shoulder strap is padded and quite comfortable. An optional shoulder harness is available, but please see my comments below before purchasing it.</p>

<p>The bag has plenty of room for a 15” laptop and a couple of file folders. I use a MacBook Air and it slips in and out with ease. It also has a zip-open expander, which I frankly find less than useful because it makes the bag a bit lopsided.</p>

<p>The bag is perfect for using for flying, especially on foreign carriers like RyanAir, which are quite strict regarding measurements and weight. The bag complies with most carry-on restrictions in terms of size. The weight limitation is a practical one. It would be difficult to carry more than 10 Kg (22 pounds) and still be able to get around comfortably. The bag also has a zippered pocket in the back that allows it to mount easily on the handle of your luggage. When you&#8217;re done, zip the bottom and you have another handy pocket to drop in your boarding passes as you trudge through the airport.</p>

<p>Other pluses include the thoughtful little things that Think Tank does. One is that the zippers work wonderfully and have a large hole drilled into the tabs so that the bag can be locked with a small lock. I carry another wire lock in one of the side pockets of the bag that allows me to attach to the bag&#8217;s zippers and the other side to an airport bench, hotel room bathtub bar, or restaurant table.  Another plus are the two smaller expandable side pockets which hold a small water bottle or sundry accessory items that we photographers collect.</p>

<p> </p>

<h3>How I use it</h3>


<p>Here is a photo of the gear I packed in the UD50 to take with me for a one-month photo tour of Italy, Sicily and Malta.</p>

<p><a href="http://blog.lesterpickerphoto.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/06/photo.jpg"><img class="size-medium wp-image-2794" title="photo" src="http://blog.lesterpickerphoto.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/06/photo-300x225.jpg" alt="" width="300" height="225"></a></p>

<p>For the record, the gear includes a Nikon D800 with attached Nikkor 24-70 f2.8, Nikkor 70-200 f2.8, Nikkor 24mm tilt-shift, Nikkor 1.4 tele-extender, Hoodman loupe, 5 Lee/Singh-Ray 4x6 filters in case, Lee large filter holder, batteries, and paraphernalia.</p>

<p>In addition, I carried my 15” MacBook Air in the purpose-built laptop compartment, along with its charger. I also devised a rig that allowed me to securely tie my 4-pound (1.8kg) travel tripod (see upcoming review on that) to the top of the bag.</p>

<p>In this front pouch I carry lots of travel accessories, including pens, my stash of teas, business cards, earbuds, etc.</p>

<p><a href="http://blog.lesterpickerphoto.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/06/photo-copy.jpg"><img class="alignnone size-medium wp-image-2795" title="photo copy" src="http://blog.lesterpickerphoto.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/06/photo-copy-300x225.jpg" alt="" width="300" height="225"></a></p>

<p> </p>

<p>I’m not sure whether the bag fools anyone into thinking this is not chock full of camera equipment (as in &#8220;Urban Disguise&#8221;), but the bag does well with one body and 2-3 lenses, filters and accessories.</p>

<h3>The Cons</h3>


<p>My biggest issue with the UD50 is that when fully loaded it is heavy and causes major neck pain for me if carried for prolonged periods of time. In fairness, I am over 60 and for a younger photographer that may not pose a problem.</p>

<p>You can purchase an optional backpack harness that allows you to carry it on your shoulders as a hiking backpack. I did this for the entire month, as I hiked through cities, towns, villages and farmlands. All I can say is that while it is somewhat of an improvement over the shoulder strap, by the end of the first day my shoulders and neck were killing me and continued to do so for the duration of the trip. The harness is only meant for short-distance use. It does not fall on the hips for support, as a true backpack should. It also does not allow for the many useful adjustments that allow a pack to stay high and close to your body. Still, I would recommend the harness if you have no choice but to use the UD50 for lengthy city shoots.</p>

<p> </p>

<h3>Conclusion</h3>


<p>Despite its limitations, I like the UD50 and will continue to use it for weekend trips to cities or special assignments. I will soon be reviewing Mindshift’s newest bag, the Rotation 180. Now THAT is a bag you can hike with all day, every day! Mindshift is a spinoff of ThinkTank.</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>If you are a photographer who has not visited Malta, book that trip now. If you do not have Malta on your bucket list, add it now.  I’ve just wound up a 5-day trip to this wonderful, exciting and visually dynamic island nation and I am already planning a second, more extensive two- or three-week return visit.</p>

<h3> Some Background</h3>


<p>The three main islands that constitute Malta are the island of Malta itself and the adjoining Gozo and the tiny Comino, situated between the two. Malta has perhaps the most fascinating history of any place I have ever visited, having been variously invaded and populated by Phoenicians, Greeks, Romans, Normans, Arabs, and finally Roman Catholics. In fact, the island today is heavily Roman Catholic and the influence of the church is evident everywhere. Gozo alone, an island you can drive completely around in a couple of hours, has more than 50 churches, some dating back to the 15<sup style="line-height: 19px;">th</sup> century. Malta itself has so many churches, basilicas, monasteries and convents, you’d be hard pressed to visit them all in a year.</p>

<p> </p>

<h3>Photography Options</h3>


<p>The photographic options in Malta are nearly endless, except for non-bird wildlife photography, as Malta has no large indigenous mammals. First are the historic structures. Did you know that the largest freestanding temples in the world are on Malta? Some 5,600 years old, the Ggantija temples are a marvel of pagan construction. To this day we know little about these early inhabitants. Ditto for the other main prehistoric temple complex, Hagar Qim. Unfortunately, photography options at these temples is severely reduced due to ongoing archaeological digs, scaffolding to shore up crumbling infrastructure, and tents covering the site at Hagar Qim to minimize environmental damage. </p>

<p>Next up are the ancient Phoenician, Greek, Roman, Norman and early Christian buildings that are in various states of repair, preservation and restoration. These sites will be Valhalla for architectural photographers. The same holds true for those who are into capturing images of historic churches. If you are into religious photography, don’t expect to spend a week here and feel good about leaving. Every church, convent, monastery and basilica is special, with a unique history attached to it.</p>

<p>Then there are the historical structures that are attached to religious causes, but are not in themselves churches. The most famous of these is the Sacra Infermeria, built in 1574 by the Knights of St. John, with a history of treating the wounded in battle, the sick and infirm for centuries. The Order even received dispensation from the Pope to allow them to perform autopsies in order to advance their medical knowledge, ostensibly to aid Christian pilgrims.</p>

<p><a href="http://blog.lesterpickerphoto.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/05/DSC_0594-Panorama.jpg"><img class="size-medium wp-image-2786" title="DSC_0594 Panorama" src="http://blog.lesterpickerphoto.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/05/DSC_0594-Panorama-300x175.jpg" alt="" width="300" height="175"></a></p>

<p> </p>

<p>Each village in Malta is a photographer’s dream. Unlike in Sicily, the people in Malta are more receptive to being photographed. These tiny villages still live a wholesome way of life and the combination of architecture, people and lifestyle make for a potent photographic stew.</p>

<p>What I am looking forward to in my next visit is capturing the stark landscapes that constitute the Maltese interior. Stone walls dating back to Roman times crisscross the land, often as farmed terraces cultivated in small plots. On these terraces you will find everything from vineyards to fruits and vegetables. Interestingly, these farmed plots go right up to the edge of major cities like Valetta.</p>

<p> </p>

<h3>Waterscapes and Cityscapes</h3>


<p>Since Malta is an island, waterscapes abound along its rocky coast and bays. There are picturesque bays and grottos, as well as sand beaches, although they are not the lush tropical variety, nor are they the forested shores we see in colder climes.</p>

<p>The Maltese cities are treasure troves of potential images, each with its unique character. Mdina is a medieval city perched atop a hill that still has 200 residents living there. Cars are prohibited, except for those of residents, making the touring experience free of hassles and full of narrow streets and ancient buildings.</p>

<p><a href="http://blog.lesterpickerphoto.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/05/DSC_0629.jpg"><img class="size-medium wp-image-2787" title="DSC_0629" src="http://blog.lesterpickerphoto.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/05/DSC_0629-200x300.jpg" alt="" width="200" height="300"></a></p>

<p> </p>

<p>Valetta, on the other hand, is a large city (at least in terms of Malta) and a mix of modern and ancient. The government is now executing major renovations of the historic fort walls, dating back to the 15<sup>th</sup> century.</p>

<p>If it is maritime heritage and folksy shots of working fishing boats and salty characters, you can’t go wrong spending a morning in Martsaxlokk fishing village, where colorful boats bob up and down in the quaint harbor. Unfortunately, a major power plant on the shoreline has ruined one sight line, but there are plenty of other ways to capture the beauty of this picturesque harbor town.</p>

<p> </p>

<h3>Easy Travel</h3>


<p>Another thing that makes Malta so inviting is that nearly everyone speaks English, plus another language, in addition to their native Maltese which is spoken nowhere else on Earth. They are also universally friendly.</p>

<p>Lodging is plentiful, ranging from B&amp;Bs to luxury hotels. The Maltese public bus system is terrific (modern and cheap), run by a private company with service throughout the island on a regular, published schedule. Driving is not advised, unless you’re used to driving on the left side. Main roads are good, but rural side roads are largely unpaved or poorly maintained. Most town and city streets are perilously narrow.</p>

<p>Boat trips, tours and private charters are available in nearly every seaside town. The weather during my stay was not cooperative for three of the days, so I could not take advantage of the boat options.</p>

<p>Restaurants are plentiful and many of them are reportedly excellent. The ones I experienced were good to very good.</p>

<p>I do plan to return to Malta, this time with a list of “must captures” and a whole lot more days. I suggest you check it out for a potential photography bucket listing. I guarantee you will not regret it.</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>This is a photography blog, and today I’m going to address a critical concern for all photographers visiting Italy- driving.  That’s right. It’s one thing to know your camera, but what good is that if you don’t arrive alive? So, if you want to live to photograph in Italy, you might want to read this.</p>

<p>I’ve just spent over two weeks driving in Italy, along its Autostradas as well as along its winding, narrow streets, in large, grand cities like Florence, as well as tiny towns so small their names did not appear on my GPS system. I’m no expert, but then again that’s the point. If you’re not an expert and just want to drive in Italy, you need to know these things. I wish someone had told me these before I rented a car.</p>

<p>First some observations. Not all Italian drivers are nuts, at least not more than Boston drivers would be if streets in Beantown were far narrower and laid out even zanier than they are now. But in the spirit of cars-don’t-kill-people, people-kill-people stupid sayings, it is about that minority of Italian drivers who might kill you that I will focus on.</p>

<p><strong style="font-size: 13px; line-height: 19px;">Mario Andretti</strong>. To Italians driving is like eating, something to be savored, a passion. They don’t just drive, they are consumed by it. When they get behind the wheel, they are Mario Andretti reincarnated. Accept it for what it is.</p>

<p><strong style="font-size: 13px; line-height: 19px;">Speed limits?</strong> Fuggedaboudit! I’m sure you have heard about this before, but when you drive on the Autostrada where posted speeds are 110-130 km/h (68-81 mph), Italian drivers view that as mere suggestions. I often drove at 130 and was passed by drivers doing a minimum of 175! Get used to it.</p>

<p><strong style="font-size: 13px; line-height: 19px;">Tailgating</strong>. Italian drivers give new meaning to the word tailgating. I would be driving at 130 kph, then merge left to pass a slower moving car, and before I could even get back into the right lane, a car would appear out of nowhere and be 6 inches off my bumper! Okay, that’s a bit of an exaggeration. Actually they were 6 millimeters away. Seriously.</p>

<p>That’s not the worst of it. When they merge back to the right, they literally cut you off. I often had cars missing my front fender by so little, I was afraid they had neatly shaved the paint off.</p>

<p><strong style="font-size: 13px; line-height: 19px;">Lines</strong>. There is no such thing as an orderly line of cars in Italy. People do not alternate when merging. Often a car will rush at your car door at a merge, then come to a stop inches away and allow you to go first. Other times they will rush at your car door then swerve around you without stopping. We asked a man in Trapani, Sicily where to line up to board the ferry and he laughingly replied: “In Sicily there are no lines!” True to form, cars came from everywhere to board the ferry. It was complete chaos for ten minutes and then, somehow, it all straightened itself out.</p>

<p><strong style="font-size: 13px; line-height: 19px;">The Pluses</strong>. On the plus side, the Autostradas are a pleasure to drive; well-paved, modern and convenient. In more than two weeks of driving I never once saw a police presence on Autostradas. Toll booths are mostly automatic and you pay with cash or credit card, although none of the directions are in English and sometimes their Internet was down so you had to deal with a toll taker. Rest areas are well spaced and, interestingly, offer wine and beer. Best of all, Italians drive on the same side of the road as we do in North America. </p>

<p> </p>

<h3>Suggestions</h3>


<p>Here are some suggestions for driving in Italy:</p>

<p><strong style="font-size: 13px; line-height: 19px;">Reserve an Automatic</strong>. Reserve an automatic car in advance if you possibly can. Dealing with the traffic in cities (more on that later) is difficult enough, but doing so while shifting gears is taxing, to say the least. I rented a 6-gear Alfa Romeo, which was a terrific car, but I stalled twice in city traffic while drivers gave me imaginative lessons in how best to use one’s middle finger.</p>

<p><strong style="font-size: 13px; line-height: 19px;">Bring Anti-Anxiety meds</strong>. Don’t ask, just get a scrip from your doctor just in case. Why? Well, let’s say that you’re stupid enough to drive the Amalfi coast (alright, at least I won’t do it again!), a drive that has sometimes been understatedly described as harrowing, you will drive along a winding, hair-pin curved, single-lane road that for some strange reason has two-way traffic on it (go figure). Tour bus after tour bus comes at you at twice the posted speed- I mean suggested speed- and misses your side view mirror by two inches. Ooops, another exaggeration, 2 millimeters. Where’s that bottle of meds when you need it? Here is a <a href="http://youtu.be/v5OM9oOaeTA">short video</a> that my wife recorded as we drove the Amalfi coast. </p>

<p><strong style="font-size: 13px; line-height: 19px;">Tunnelphobia</strong>? If you have a fear of tunnels, do not drive in Sicily from Messina to Cefalu. That drive takes you through literally dozens and dozens of tunnels. On at least ten 5-km stretches of road, you are in tunnels more than 60% of the time, in some cases 75%. Some of the tunnels are old and narrow, so be forewarned. Most of the older tunnels are being replaced and the modern ones are terrific, with wide lanes and a breakdown lane and turn-outs to get your vehicle off-road in case of a mishap.</p>

<p><strong>Ferries</strong>. Many of Italy’s ferries are one-way load-unload boats. That means that you will either have to back in your car at the point of departure or back it out at the arrival port. Be prepared for that eventuality.</p>

<p><strong>Parking</strong>. You’re kidding, right? Good luck!</p>

<p><strong>City driving</strong>. Don’t if you can avoid it. Park outside the city and take a bus, shuttle or train into town. In many cities, like Florence (called Firenze by Italians), you can get a huge fine for driving into the city center. Streets are incredibly narrow, having been built for foot traffic or horse-drawn wagons (we’re talking Roman wagons!) 2,000 years ago.  Cars are parked and double-parked all over the streets making negotiating city traffic a torment. I was only able to do it because I grew up in Brooklyn (ha, ha!).</p>

<p><a href="http://blog.lesterpickerphoto.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/05/DSC_8945.jpg"><img class="size-medium wp-image-2779" title="DSC_8945" src="http://blog.lesterpickerphoto.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/05/DSC_8945-200x300.jpg" alt="" width="200" height="300"></a></p>

<p><strong>Cycles</strong>. You have to get used to motorcycles and bicycles in Italy. I mean a lot of them, as in a whole big bunch, bigger than a bizzilion. The trouble is that motorcycles obey no rules of the road that my wife and I could discern. They will pass you on the right or left. They will weave in and out in city traffic. They park in the road, on sidewalks, behind your rear bumper, even in apartment hallways.</p>

<p><strong>No Lanes</strong>. Forget the middle lane that separates drivers going in opposite directions. Italian drivers see that as a rubber line that can be bent to one’s will when passing. It’s up to you to stay alert for the frequent drivers that pass on curves as you are coming from the opposite direction.</p>

<p><strong>Signage</strong>. Italy has far fewer road signs than do we in North America. Street signs in cities are far and few between. You will be told to turn on a certain street, but there is not a sign to be seen. We navigated pretty well by using a GPS (buy the Italian map upgrade before you go) and a Michelin map, but we also got lost periodically. However, we always view those times as an adventure. Some of my favorite images have come from those “alternate” routes.</p>

<p>The truth is that some people will love driving in Italy (that would be me) and some will be traumatized by it (that would be my wife, but part of that is possibly- remote as it is-  my inattentive driving) . One couple my wife knows rented a car and then simply left it right in the middle of the first city they traveled through. While public transportation is widely available, we photographers want the flexibility to stop whenever the light and scenery are right. All I’m saying is be forewarned. Teasing aside, I found Italian drivers to be mostly considerate, although their pattern of driving is different from ours.</p>

<p>Have you have had a “driving in Italy” experience or a driving tip? Share it here, but please keep the language clean. </p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>If you’re photo travel plans include Sicily, you will not want to miss the small, medieval town of Erice. Situated on a mountaintop near Trapani, on the southern coast, Erice is reached by car, private and public bus, or cable car.</p>

<p><a href="http://blog.lesterpickerphoto.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/05/DSC_9824-2.jpg"><img class="alignnone size-medium wp-image-2769" title="DSC_9824-2" src="http://blog.lesterpickerphoto.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/05/DSC_9824-2-200x300.jpg" alt="" width="200" height="300"></a></p>

<p>This little town in a jewel for photographers. Every street, every corner you turn, offers exciting opportunities for photography, from architectural to travel to people.</p>

<p><a href="http://blog.lesterpickerphoto.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/05/DSC_9844-2.jpg"><img class="alignnone size-medium wp-image-2770" title="DSC_9844-2" src="http://blog.lesterpickerphoto.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/05/DSC_9844-2-300x200.jpg" alt="" width="300" height="200"></a></p>

<p>The town shelters myriad churches and monasteries, but there is also a castle, stone-paved streets, houses and small boutique hotels.</p>

<p><a href="http://blog.lesterpickerphoto.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/05/DSC_9879-2-Panorama-2.jpg"><img class="alignnone size-medium wp-image-2771" title="DSC_9879-2 Panorama-2" src="http://blog.lesterpickerphoto.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/05/DSC_9879-2-Panorama-2-243x300.jpg" alt="" width="243" height="300"></a></p>

<p> </p>

<p>One of my favorite things about travel photography is the opportunity to meet wonderful people, living different lives than mine, but still enjoying a quality of life that works for them. Whether children, adults or the elderly, I love peoples faces and their life experiences etched-or not etched, in the case of children- into the lines of their faces.</p>

<p><a href="http://blog.lesterpickerphoto.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/05/DSC_9923-2.jpg"><img class="size-medium wp-image-2772" title="DSC_9923-2" src="http://blog.lesterpickerphoto.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/05/DSC_9923-2-200x300.jpg" alt="" width="200" height="300"></a></p>

<p> </p>

<p>That is how I met a new friend, Francesco Bondi, otherwise known as Barbablu.  This wonderful man creates and sells toys he makes himself. His life motto is: “Resistere E’ Creare; Creare E’ Resistere”- “To resist is to create, to create is to resist.” How can you not instantly like a man who lives like that?</p>

<p>After seeing his infectious enthusiasm for his toys, for life really, out in the narrow street, I asked if I could photograph him (you must do that in Sicily in particular).  I did so for a few minutes and when I showed him the results, he hugged and kissed me in the street, laughing all the time. My wife and I spent the next fifteen minutes or so talking with him in his spare English and our non-existent Italian. It always amazes me how people can connect across cultures with nothing more than smiles, hugs, gestures and a willing heart.</p>

<p><a href="http://blog.lesterpickerphoto.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/05/DSC_9905-2.jpg"><img class="size-medium wp-image-2773" title="DSC_9905-2" src="http://blog.lesterpickerphoto.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/05/DSC_9905-2-200x300.jpg" alt="" width="200" height="300"></a></p>

<p> </p>

<p>Of course, I sent Barbablu’s image to his companion by Internet that evening. I will also mail him a photograph that I will print myself as soon as I get home. I feel that is our obligation as travel photographers.</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>Off the coast of Trapani, Sicily, right at the point of the boot, sit the three tiny Egadi Islands. The largest is Favignana and I’m here right now photographing. I thought I’d share with you today’s adventure as an illustration of creative choice in photography.</p>

<p>Atop the highest point of the island there is an old fortress, which some locals prefer to call a castle.  My guess is that those who call it a castle have never done the strenuous hike up there.</p>

<p> </p>

<p><a href="http://blog.lesterpickerphoto.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/05/DSC_9395.jpg"><img class="size-medium wp-image-2761" title="DSC_9395" src="http://blog.lesterpickerphoto.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/05/DSC_9395-300x200.jpg" alt="" width="300" height="200"></a></p>

<p>The fortress sits about 1,000 feet above the historic town (in Europe everything is historic, at least by American standards). We climbed it today and spent a glorious couple of hours exploring the land immediately around it and then poking through the abandoned ruins.</p>

<p>As a landscape, travel and wildlife photographer, the overwhelming majority of my work is in color. But, once inside the fortress, which is a shambles, it was obvious to me that I wanted to interpret the scenes in black &amp; white. To me it had a “feel” of grittiness and abandonment that was best expressed in B&amp;W. I’m sure that another photographer would interpret the scenes beautifully in color, and that is one of the many things I just love about photography.</p>

<p>In any case, here are a few images from that visit, quickly done this evening as I recovered from the hike.</p>

<p><a href="http://blog.lesterpickerphoto.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/05/DSC_9453-Edit.jpg"><img class="alignnone size-medium wp-image-2763" title="DSC_9453-Edit" src="http://blog.lesterpickerphoto.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/05/DSC_9453-Edit-300x200.jpg" alt="" width="300" height="200"></a></p>

<p>The technical information is that all the images from today’s shoot were imported into Lightroom 4. I then selected several potentials for export into Nik software’s Silver Efex Pro, a wonderful, easy-to-use program. A few fast adjustments and here you are.</p>

<p><a href="http://blog.lesterpickerphoto.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/05/DSC_9470-Edit.jpg"><img class="alignnone size-medium wp-image-2764" title="DSC_9470-Edit" src="http://blog.lesterpickerphoto.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/05/DSC_9470-Edit-200x300.jpg" alt="" width="200" height="300"></a></p>

<p>Of course, when I get home I’ll post-process the original images first, then do whatever I need in Lightroom, PhotoShop or Silver Efex and hopefully improve on the results.</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>This was my first visit to Pompei and every preconception I had of the site was dashed within minutes. I had a schedule to keep and I alloted two hours to visiting Pompei. Instead, we ended up spending five very active hours and when the park closed we were one of the last to leave. I could easily have spent another day or two exploring these ancient ruins- and in fact I expect I will because my photography was rushed and I was not allowed to bring in my tripod without permission, which I will try to get next time in advance.</p>

<p>All I can say is that every superlative pales in comparison to the actual experience of being there. To think that 20,000 people lived, worked and played there and then were wiped out within a day is nearly impossible to grok. To be honest, if I had to pick a time and place to have lived other than now, it Pompeii goes to the top of my list. Of course I&#8217;d rather not have it be in 79 A.D. when Mt. Vesuvius blew mightily, sending ash more than 20,000 feet high. I&#8217;d also like to have been one of the lucky wealthy few, who lived in luxury beyond imagining.</p>

<p>I had just arrived and was exploring another area of the park, when I turned around and saw an incredible sight. A cloud formation had formed over Mt. Vesuvius. I quickly took some images.</p>

<p><a href="http://blog.lesterpickerphoto.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/05/owls.jpg"><img class="alignnone size-medium wp-image-2752" title="owls" src="http://blog.lesterpickerphoto.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/05/owls-300x200.jpg" alt="" width="300" height="200"></a></p>

<p>However, when I ran to a spot closer to the mountain for a few snaps, the cloud had already passed and the effect lost. But I coud not help but wonder how the people felt when the eruption occurred in an ear-piercing blast and the rain of ash suffocated them. It gave me the chills.</p>

<p>The Pompeii preserve is huge. If you end up going, I strongly suggest you allot 2-3 days to tour it thoroughly. Make sure to rent the audio tour. We bought the tour book, but there was never enough time to find the correct place in the book and then read it. Fortunately, we met a man who worked there and he filled in many of the blanks.</p>

<p>One exhibit particularly affected me, and that was a display of the casts of several of the victims. The residents of Pompei died so quickly from suffocation in over ten feet of hot ash, they and their animals were literally frozen in place. I noted a German tourist who stood by one of the cases holding a casualty and I was struck by his emotional reaction.</p>

<p><a href="http://blog.lesterpickerphoto.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/05/owls-22.jpg"><img class="alignnone size-medium wp-image-2756" title="owls-2" src="http://blog.lesterpickerphoto.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/05/owls-22-300x200.jpg" alt="" width="300" height="200"></a></p>

<p> </p>

<p>The overwhelming impression one gets is that Pompei was an incredible place to live, at least if you had even moderate wealth. The artwork and artisan craftwork is sublime. The mosaics are awesome. One piece showing Alexander battling Darius is composed of over two million tiny tiles.  The buildings and homes are architectural marvels. If your plans include a visit to Italy, I&#8217;d advise you to be sure that you get to Pompei&#8230; for at least two days.</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>Well, we arrived in Rome in the rain, got in a rental car and hightailed it out of town to a marvelous B&amp;B (more on that in a minute). We had taken a red-eye from Baltimore to London and I could not get more than a hour of very disturbed sleep (how can anyone sleep in Economy Plus, let alone Economy!?). Then our next flight to Rome was delayed, so by the time I arrived I was bleary-eyed and bushed. Knowing this would be a possibility, I had booked our first night at a B&amp;B in Civitella San Paolo, about an hour out of Rome. Turns out that was a smart decision.</p>

<p>Our hosts at Le Tre Querce B&amp;B, Louisa and Riccardo, were simply awesome. One look at us and Louisa insisted on making us dinner.In 30 minutes she put on the table a dinner better than many an Italian restaurant in the States. Firm spaghetti with a delicate sauce (homemade, of course), fresh salad, hearty bread, black olives from their property, and the absolute best Romano-Parmesan cheese my wife and I have ever tasted. It was creamy, not crumbly, and oh so flavorful. The meal was topped with a bowl of fresh cut strawberries. And red wine, naturally. Bellisimo!!</p>

<p><a href="http://blog.lesterpickerphoto.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/05/photo-copy.jpg"><img class="size-medium wp-image-2742" title="photo copy" src="http://blog.lesterpickerphoto.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/05/photo-copy-300x225.jpg" alt="" width="300" height="225"></a></p>

<p>After a relaxing night in an immaculately clean room, and a hot shower, we were ready to tackle our drive to Siena for my first photo shoot. But first, a hearty breakfast, courtesy of Louisa&#8217;s kitchen. Now I was ready for a nap, but instead we headed for the road, saying arrivederci to Louisa and Riccardo. We could not have hoped to stay in a warmer, more home-like, friendly place.</p>

<p><a href="http://blog.lesterpickerphoto.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/05/louisa-riccardo-le-querce-.jpg"><img class="size-medium wp-image-2743" title="louisa-riccardo-le-querce-" src="http://blog.lesterpickerphoto.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/05/louisa-riccardo-le-querce--300x200.jpg" alt="" width="300" height="200"></a></p>

<p>Just a quick aside about Italian drivers. They are not near so crazy as a lot of people say. Yes, they do ride your tail when you&#8217;re doing 120 kph. But they don&#8217;t beep or act rude. They sit there patiently, literally 12 inches from your rear bumper, giving you fits, until you pull over, which in my case took about 1.3 seconds every time it happened. They also drive down one lane cobblestone streets that amazingly have two-way traffic at insane speeds. Okay, &#8216;nuf said (for now).</p>

<p>Here&#8217;s a quick shot of the Duomo in Siena, in one of the rare non-rainy moments we had on our first few days. The architecture, of course mostly church related, is breathtaking.</p>

<p><a href="http://blog.lesterpickerphoto.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/05/duopmo-siena-2013.jpg"><img class="alignnone size-medium wp-image-2744" title="duopmo-siena-2013" src="http://blog.lesterpickerphoto.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/05/duopmo-siena-2013-300x200.jpg" alt="" width="300" height="200"></a></p>

<p>More on Siena and Florence later in the week. Still trying to catch up with the sleep deprivation.</p>
