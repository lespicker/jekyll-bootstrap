  <div class="entry-content"><p>Here’s a little secret about all professional photographers (and I do mean all). Every one of us is paranoid. Some of us are just more paranoid than others.</p>

<p>Of course what I’m talking about is the pro photographer’s need to back up his or her images in the field. Each of us has our own method of doing so, depending on one’s level of comfort and relationship with God. In any case, backing up is a good idea even if you are a newbie photographer. You certainly don’t want to risk losing your images from your 3-week European family vacation.</p>

<p>Here are the methods I use to back up in the field and at home.</p>

<p><strong><em> In the Field</em></strong></p>

<p><a href="http://blog.lesterpickerphoto.com/wp-content/uploads/2009/06/pixelpocketrocket.jpg"><img class="size-full wp-image-337 " title="pixelpocketrocket" src="http://blog.lesterpickerphoto.com/wp-content/uploads/2009/06/pixelpocketrocket.jpg" alt="" width="192" height="156"></a></p>

<p>First, I carry at least 12 Compact Flash cards for my Nikon cameras, ranging from 8 GB to 16GB each. Rarely do I shoot through all the cards on an assignment, even if I’m gone for two or three weeks (and I shoot RAW only). As I use each card I put it in a nifty case called a Pixel Pocket Rocket (<a href="http://www.thinktankphoto.com">www.thinktankphoto.com</a>), facing backward, so I know it has been used. From that point on, my used cards are either on my person or nestled comfortable in a hotel safe.</p>

<p>Each night, I back up my flash cards to my Aperture software on my 15” MacBook Pro laptop <em><strong>and</strong></em> to a Western Digital (WD) 500GB portable drive. I usually carry two of these drives with me. They are incredibly small, lightweight, durable and inexpensive. Every few days, I also back up my Aperture library to the second WD drive. Backing up to my laptop also gives me an opportunity to review my images on a large screen and to gauge how the assignment is proceeding.</p>

<p><a href="http://blog.lesterpickerphoto.com/wp-content/uploads/2009/06/wdfMP_Essential.jpg"><img class="size-full wp-image-338" title="wdfMP_Essential" src="http://blog.lesterpickerphoto.com/wp-content/uploads/2009/06/wdfMP_Essential.jpg" alt="" width="300" height="300"></a></p>

<p>Paranoid, right? Well, if you’re not convinced yet, listen to this. On the way home, I make sure to carry every backup with me onto the plane (well I sure as hell am not going to trust my livelihood to airport baggage handlers!). However I divvy them up so that if my carry-on rolling camera bag is stolen, I still have one of the WD drives in my pocket and I haven’t lost the entire shoot. If my wife is traveling with me, I might give her another one of the drives to carry on board in her purse. My laptop is in its carrying case. All the original flash cards are in the Pixel Pocket Rocket, safely tucked into the camera bag. Four-way protection, ahh!</p>

<p>When I get home, I have the choice of downloading the originals from the flash cards to my desktop system or transferring the entire shoot from the WD drives or the laptop. In any case, I’m well protected from loss. Once I download the images <strong><em>and</em></strong> backup my office system, then I format my flash cards and the WD drives and delete the images from the laptop. Now I’m ready for my next photo shoot.</p>

<p><strong><em> At Home</em></strong></p>

<p>My home office involves a MacPro system. My Aperture library resides on a large hard drive. Each night it is automatically backed up onto another hard drive and once a week the entire system is backed up onto a third hard drive.</p>

<p>But, what about fire, flood or pestilence? Good question. I cover that base by keeping two, 2-TB backup drives in a safe deposit box at my bank, which is exactly one block from me. On one of the first days of every month I retrieve those drives. I back up the entire system on one and just my Aperture library on the other.</p>

<p>Colleagues of mine have variations on this theme. Several make an annual back up of all their images shot during that year and file that backup offsite. Others make permanent backups of each trip or assignment onto a growing stack of WD drives. As the saying goes, God is good, but you’d better have a backup plan.</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>One of the thorniest challenges for professional and advanced amateur photographers alike is packing for a trip. Every year the situation seems to worsen. Airlines are not only more restrictive than ever, they are also arbitrary and capricious. One time I’ll be let through and on a different leg of the same trip I’ll be stopped and told I cannot take my bag onto the plane. Or I’ll be in a remote location where a bush pilot will severely limit my carry-on bag.</p>

<p>One not-so-humorous incident (at the time) happened on an Air Canada flight to Yukon Territory. I was told my wheel-on camera bag was too heavy. I’m used to that by now, so I always stuff my camera vest into the outside pocket of my bag. With a line of impatient people behind me, I unloaded a few heavy lenses and stuffed them into my vest pockets and strung my DSLR with a 70-200 attached around my neck. The ticket counter woman was pissed, but she reluctantly accepted defeat.</p>

<p>Off I went to the gate. I was still 90 minutes early, so I repacked all my equipment back into my bag. When they finally called my row, I wheeled up to board. Then I saw her! The ticket agent at the gate, you guessed it, was the same woman who had been at the counter. She pulled me aside and actually made me do the whole unpacking shtick all over again! Once aboard some unhappy fliers watched me repack again as they waited to pass up the aisle.</p>

<p>As an aside I have to tell you that I weigh 163 pounds soaking wet. With my wheel-on, I would clock in at under 200, max. The man who sat next to me weighed a conservative 240-260 pounds AND he carried a computer bag AND an overnighter. Does this airline weight regulation make any sense… at all?</p>

<p>Anyway, what is a serious photographer to do? First a deep, dark secret. I probably have more photo bags in my office than my wife has pocketbooks! Seriously, over the years I have accumulated more over-the-shoulder, around-the-waist, wheeling, backpacking and sling photography bags than Imelda Marcus has shoes. But, if my wife is reading this, I swear I need them all, Hon!</p>

<p>I very regularly use the following:</p>

<ul>
<li><em><strong>Think Tank Airport International V2.0 Rolling Bag
</strong> </em></li>
    <li><em><strong>Think Tank Rotation 360 backpack</strong></em></li>
    <li><em><strong>Think Tank Speed Demon
</strong> </em></li>
    <li><em><strong>Think Tank Speed Freak
</strong> </em></li>
    <li><em><strong>Think Tank Airport Check-In
</strong> </em></li>
    <li><em><strong>Lowe Pro Nature Trekker</strong></em></li>
</ul>


<p><a href="http://blog.lesterpickerphoto.com/wp-content/uploads/2009/05/rotation-360-1.jpg"><img class="size-medium wp-image-334" title="rotation-360--1" src="http://blog.lesterpickerphoto.com/wp-content/uploads/2009/05/rotation-360-1-300x192.jpg" alt="" width="300" height="192"></a></p>

<p>Along with these basics, I have an assortment of dedicated side packs, pouches and lens cases that fasten to the sides of the bags.</p>

<p>Obviously, I single-handedly keep Think Tank’s business in the black. But, although their products are expensive, to me they are worth every penny. They are incredibly rugged and ingeniously well thought out, probably because their designers are also professional photographers. They also have some of the best security features in the industry. Go to <a href="http://www.thinktankphoto.com">www.thinktankphoto.com</a> for more info. While at their site, be sure to download a copy of their free helpful publication on how to travel with camera equipment and tips on how to get through airport security.</p>

<p>My Lowepro (<a href="http://www.lowepro.com">www.lowepro.com</a>) is my go-to bag for backpacking into rough terrain, where I may have to bring several days of equipment. It never ceases to amaze me how much cra… I mean, gear I can pack into that thing. I usually add a side pouch for water and another for snacks.</p>

<p>I always pack my tripod in my checked luggage and pad it well. Since I exclusively use rugged Eagle Creek luggage (<a href="http://www.eaglecreek.com">www.eaglecreek.com</a>), with their roomy interiors, I always take one of my Think Tank waist packs with me, place it in the luggage and pack it tight with my clothes and some other camera accessories. Then, when I get to my photo location, I have a daypack to use as needed.</p>

<p>Let me know your photo equipment travel tips. In a later blog I’ll share with you what I carry in my backpack for remote shooting.</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>How would you like to increase the dramatic impact of your photography by an order of magnitude? I’m not exactly sure what that last phrase means, but it sounds impressive. This is what I do mean, though. If there is one photographic technique that can put your images on steroids, it’s <em>shooting tight</em>.</p>

<p><img class="size-medium wp-image-29 alignleft" style="margin-left: 15px; margin-right: 15px;" title="Galapagos Tortoise-wide" src="http://blog.lesterpickerphoto.com/wp-content/uploads/2009/05/galapagos-tortoise-wide.jpg?w=300" alt="Galapagos Tortoise" width="300" height="205"></p>

<p>By shooting tight, I’m referring to zooming in on the subject so that you remove distracting elements and instead highlight its most salient feature(s). Take the photo below as an example. I shot it on one of my trips to the Galapagos Islands off the coast of Ecuador. In and of itself the photo is ‘okay.’ It’s a textbook example of the giant Galapagos tortoise, the same ones documented by Charles Darwin in the 19<sup>th</sup> century. Therein lies the problem with the image. Like a textbook, it’s b-o-r-i-n-g. It would be fine for a biology text, but it lacks punch. Zero drama.</p>

<p>Now take a look at this image, shot the same day. See the difference? Notice the emotional impact?</p>

<p><img class="aligncenter size-medium wp-image-30" title="Galapagos Tortoise-tight" src="http://blog.lesterpickerphoto.com/wp-content/uploads/2009/05/galapagos-tortoise-tight.jpg?w=300" alt="Galapagos Tortoise-tight" width="300" height="200"><img class="size-medium wp-image-31 alignright" style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;" title="Nazca Booby with Chick-wide" src="http://blog.lesterpickerphoto.com/wp-content/uploads/2009/05/nazca-booby-with-chick-wide.jpg?w=300" alt="Nazca Booby with Chick-wide" width="300" height="194"></p>

<p>The same concept holds true for the following images. The Nazca Booby was photographed in the Galapagos and everyone else I was with photographed the mother and bird as a whole, as I initially did. Some even shot the scene wide angle to get in the rocks and water in the background, thereby making it hard t see the mother and chick at all. I managed to squeeze off a few telephoto shots of the baby alone and I like the effect (hopefully my editors will, too).</p>

<p><img class="aligncenter size-medium wp-image-32" title="Nazca Booby with Chick-tight" src="http://blog.lesterpickerphoto.com/wp-content/uploads/2009/05/nazca-booby-with-chick-tight.jpg?w=300" alt="Nazca Booby with Chick-tight" width="300" height="200"><img class="size-medium wp-image-33 alignleft" style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;" title="amusement park-wide" src="http://blog.lesterpickerphoto.com/wp-content/uploads/2009/05/amusement-park-wide.jpg?w=200" alt="amusement park-wide" width="200" height="300"></p>

<p>This next series really show two images with entirely different effects. However, I just wanted to show how shooting tight can result in creative applications that may not be immediately apparent in the wider image. I took this initial shot for a series on amusement parks. This was taken at Salem Willows in Massachusetts.</p>

<p>The tight rendition is the stuff of kids’ nightmares, a bas relief of Chucky.</p>

<p><img class="aligncenter size-medium wp-image-34" title="amusement park-tight" src="http://blog.lesterpickerphoto.com/wp-content/uploads/2009/05/amusement-park-tight.jpg?w=300" alt="amusement park-tight" width="300" height="200"></p>

<p>Finally, shooting tight works wonders for people shots, but I’ll leave that topic for another day.</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p><strong>I </strong>don’t mean to be sarcastic… no, I take that back. I do mean to be sarcastic. Here goes. There is no rule that says you must hold your camera at eye level, in a standing position, with the camera in landscape orientation every time. There, I said it!</p>

<p>As a professional photographer and former editor, I figure that about 98% of all photos taken by amateurs are in landscape orientation. That, in itself, would not be so bad. But when you couple that with the dreaded eye-level perspective, the results are often dull and uninteresting, true snapshots rather than exciting photographs.</p>

<p>If you’re primarily into snapshots, that’s fine. There’s nothing like a snapshot of the Pyramids (if you can get one without shops and hawkers that encroach ever closer every year) or the husband standing at the rim of the Grand Canyon (“Go ahead, Honey, keep backing up… a few more steps…”). But to get truly unique images, to move beyond snapshots to true photographs, try this technique of the pros; Shoot High and Shoot Low.</p>

<p><img class="size-medium wp-image-40 alignleft" style="border: 0 initial initial; margin: 0 15px;" title="Navajo Tree and Cliff" src="http://blog.lesterpickerphoto.com/wp-content/uploads/2009/05/navajotreerootcliff3.jpg?w=199" alt="Navajo Tree and Cliff" width="199" height="300"><h3>Change Your Perspective</h3>
The main take-away to this tip is to move away from what I call the plane of conformity. Since most people take a picture standing up, try photographing from a crouched position or from your knees. I took the photo below on Navajo land in Utah. While others stood around photographing this interesting tree, I laid on my stomach and shot this from root level. Maybe the shot works for you and maybe it doesn’t. Art, after all, is subjective. But the image is not the typical one you would see associated with this particular view. To my eyes the image benefits from the down-low perspective.</p>

<p><img class="size-medium wp-image-42 alignright" style="margin-left: 15px; margin-right: 15px;" title="hawaiiphilodendronleaves" src="http://blog.lesterpickerphoto.com/wp-content/uploads/2009/05/hawaiiphilodendronleaves1.jpg?w=300" alt="hawaiiphilodendronleaves" width="300" height="224"></p>

<p>In a similar vein, my wife and I were hiking Hawaii’s spectacular Napali Coast on the island of Kauai. At an overpass, everyone else on the trail took a photo of one particular scenic view. Each person would approach the lookout, bring the camera up to their eye and shoot the very same shot. Again, there’s nothing wrong with that, since you’ve captured that memory forever. But, whenever I see people taking the same exact photo, I turn around and look the other way. I look up, I look down. In this case, I spotted the sun backlighting these philodendron leaves, high above my head.</p>

<p><img class="size-medium wp-image-43 alignleft" style="margin-left: 15px; margin-right: 15px;" title="galapagossealionpups" src="http://blog.lesterpickerphoto.com/wp-content/uploads/2009/05/galapagossealionpups1.jpg?w=300" alt="galapagossealionpups" width="300" height="200"><h3>Get Down!</h3>
For this close-up of sea lion pups playing in the Galapagos, I laid down in the sand for twenty minutes, shooting away while the pups frolicked. Sure my elbows and clothes got wet, but I came away with a series of shots I wanted.</p>

<p><img class="size-medium wp-image-44 alignright" style="margin-left: 15px; margin-right: 15px;" title="marshgrassesatdawn" src="http://blog.lesterpickerphoto.com/wp-content/uploads/2009/05/marshgrassesatdawn1.jpg?w=300" alt="marshgrassesatdawn" width="300" height="198"></p>

<p>A similar thing happened with this shot of marsh grasses. I had to lay down on the boardwalk of a nature center at sunrise to capture this image.</p>

<p><img class="size-medium wp-image-45 alignleft" style="margin: 0 15px;" title="Egypt-Marbles" src="http://blog.lesterpickerphoto.com/wp-content/uploads/2009/05/egypt-marbles1.jpg?w=175" alt="Egypt-Marbles" width="200" height="325"></p>

<p>Here’s another Shoot High-Shoot Low tip. When photographing kids, get down to their level. I took this shot of a boy playing marbles in Luxor, Egypt. Had I stood up and shot eye level, the shot would have lost out. By crouching down and pointing my camera up at the boy, I got a marble-ous perspective on the game (ok, I never said I was an expert punner).</p>

<p>So, next time you&#8217;re out photographing, be bold, be adventurous. Shoot High-Shoot Low. Heck, just shoot. I think you’ll be happy with your results.</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>Okay, I’ll admit it. I’m a senior photographer. Not senior as in jobsite seniority. I’m old. Maybe even ancient (well, 60 no longer seems as old as it did when I was thirty).</p>

<p>For us photo geezers, I offer the following: my favorite accessories that I employ in the field, whether I’m shooting landscapes in Ecuador or wildlife in Africa. I&#8217;m a professional photographer, so use or modify these suggestions to suit your photographic needs. And, send in your own suggestions which I will post on my site and credit to your experience and wisdom.</p>

<p><strong><a href="http://blog.lesterpickerphoto.com/wp-content/uploads/2009/05/hravthumb1.gif"><img class="alignright size-medium wp-image-247" title="hrav(thumb)" src="http://blog.lesterpickerphoto.com/wp-content/uploads/2009/05/hravthumb1-277x300.gif" alt="" width="277" height="300"></a>Right Angle Viewer (RAV)</strong>. As far as I’m concerned this is a must for the over-fifty photographer. You attach the RAV to your viewfinder and voila!, you don’t have to lay on your stomach to get a shot of that rare flower. RAVs rotate so that you can use them in landscape or portrait mode. They’re great to use with a tripod when photographing wildflowers or insects. Tip: since the RAV optics do not factor into the actual photo (that’s what the lens mounted on the front of the camera is for), you don’t need to buy the one made by your camera manufacturer. You can get one for half the price from secondary manufacturers. My favorite is <a href="http://www.hoodman.com">www.hoodman.com</a>.</p>

<p><strong>Knee Pads</strong>. Don’t laugh, knee pads are the greatest invention since sliced bread for seniors. Try kneeling for ten minutes photographing those cute sea lions in the Galapagos. The lava rocks will gnaw at your kneecaps and you’ll feel the stress on your knees for days. Sure I look like a dork, but if I’m comfortable in the field, I usually bring home the goods. Try on pairs at Home Depot or Lowes.</p>

<p><strong>Photo Glove</strong>s. These are lightweight, rubber-coated gloves that keep bulk to a minimum and grip strength at a maximum. You can’t go wrong with the ones made by LowePro.</p>

<p><strong>Plastic Reading Glasse</strong>s. In the field I use cheap plastic frames with polycarbonate lenses, less than $20 at the local drugstore. I always carry an extra pair with me, since without reading glasses I can’t read a damned thing on my LCD screen.</p>

<p><strong>Tripod</strong>. I hate to admit it, but aging has taken its toll on my joints. I used to be able to handhold a 70-200mm lens all day and still get sharp images at 1/50 of a second at twilight. No more. Now my tripod is my #1 photo tool. Tip: buy one of the carbon fiber tripods for their reduced weight. Then put foam pads on the upper leg sections so you can carry it balanced on your shoulder without pain.</p>

<p><strong>Diopter adjustment</strong>. Lots of folks either forget or don’t know that you can adjust the diopter setting on most mid- to high-end DSLR cameras to customize it for your eyesight. Thebest way to use it is to set your camera on a tripod and autofocus on a book jacket propped up on a table. Take the shot and be sure that the focus is tack sharp. Now look through the viewfinder without changing any setting. If the book does not look tack sharp to your eyes, adjust the diopter wheel until the image appears perfectly sharp to you.</p>

<p><strong>Your suggestions, please</strong>… I welcome suggestions from other senior photographers out there. Please let me know what you use to make photographing easier for you. Until then, use sunscreen and drink lots of water (ibuprofen helps, too!).</p>

<p>If there is one question that amateurs most often ask about my images, it’s: “How do you get those clouds to pop out so much?” The alternative question is how I get the blue skies to render so… well, blue.</p>

<h3>Use a Polarizing Filter</h3>


<p>The short answer is that I use a polarizing filter probably 80% of the time when I’m shooting outdoors during the daytime. It’s the not-so-secret ingredient that pros use all the time because our editors, and people who buy our images for their home or office, want to view landscapes where the colors are nicely saturated and clouds and skies are delineated.</p>

<p>A polarizing filter works by taking scattered light and filtering it so that you have more parallel rays getting through to the camera’s sensor (or film, if you are still using a film camera). You don’t need to know all the physics, but the effect is powerful. See the accompanying photos that I took on a recent trip down the Colorado River and you’ll get an idea of how a polarizer can improve your photos.</p>

<p><img class="size-thumbnail wp-image-12 alignright" style="margin: 0 15px;" title="Colorado river6" src="http://blog.lesterpickerphoto.com/wp-content/uploads/2009/05/colorado-river6.jpg?w=150" alt="Colorado river6" width="300" height="175"></p>

<p>If you are willing to invest in a polarizer, make sure you buy what is known as a circular polarizer. A circular polarizer consists of two pieces of glass that rotate relative to each other. You can dial in just the right amount of polarization to suit your creative vision. Polarizers also cut through some of the haze that ruins images on hot, humid days. Polarizers can also help make reflections more prominent.</p>

<h3>Ins and Outs of Polarizers</h3>


<p>Like any photographic accessory, polarizers have limitations. Due to the physics of light, they are most effective when they point 90 degrees away from the sun. As yopu face toward or directly away from the sun, they are pretty iseless. And they have drawbacks. First, they are expensive. A good one for a DSLR will set you back at least $100 and can go up to $200. They also reduce light transmission by one or two stops, which can either help you capture that special image (think blurred water over a waterfall) or hinder your efforts. They also add a certain hassle factor, since there will be times when you are out shooting and as light conditions change you will invariably have to be screwing the filter on or off.</p>

<p><img class="alignright size-thumbnail wp-image-14" style="margin: 0 15px;" title="hoya-cir" src="http://blog.lesterpickerphoto.com/wp-content/uploads/2009/05/hoya-cir.jpg?w=150" alt="hoya-cir" width="150" height="100"></p>

<p>Every DSLR can accommodate polarizers, since the front of lenses for DSLRs have a screw thread. Unfortunately, due to the sheer variety of point-and-shoot cameras, few manufacturers make polarizing filters for them. In fact, a good polarizer could conceivably cost more than an inexpensive or even a moderately priced point-and-shoot. But even if your point-and-shoot does not accommodate screw-on polarizers, the good news is you can still use one. A cool feature of a polarizer is that you can hold it up to your eye and rotate the outer glass and you will see the effects immediately. Now, without changing the relative position of the polarizer, just hold it right up to your lens, point and shoot. I guarantee you will see dramatic improvements in your landscapes!</p>
