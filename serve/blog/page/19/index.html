  <div class="entry-content"><p>I’m in Haines, Alaska right now (August, 2011) to photograph grizzly bears feeding on salmon in the Chilkoot River, just outside town. In the three days I’ve been here, I’ve talked to a number of town folk, as well as with <a href="http://www.hartmier.com">Richard Hartmier</a>, a Yukon-based photographer who has been visiting Haines for many years now. My comments are based on those conversations as well as my own impressions and experiences.</p>

<p><a href="http://blog.lesterpickerphoto.com/wp-content/uploads/2011/08/LAP1817.jpg"><img class="size-medium wp-image-1495" title="_LAP1817" src="http://blog.lesterpickerphoto.com/wp-content/uploads/2011/08/LAP1817-300x199.jpg" alt="" width="300" height="199"></a></p>

<h3>An Overview</h3>


<p>Haines is located on the coast, just a ferry ride from Skagway. Both towns cater to cruise ship tourists, but while Skagway has blossomed economically from that trade, Haines has been left in the dust. Not that Skagway is good and Haines a bad place to visit. If you have ever been to Skagway by ship you know that to some it can look at times like a honky tonk town, full of trinket and tee shirt shops.</p>

<p>Haines only welcomes one or two ships a week and they tend to be somewhat smaller than those visiting Skagway. The town is a favorite for winter vacationers from Canada’s Yukon Territory as it is due south and its coastal location moderates its weather, a welcome relief to frozen Yukoners. During the annual salmon run the bears compete head to toe with anglers that line the banks of its rivers. In fact, the bears have learned to steal the catches from the fishermen.</p>

<p>But the town has seen better days, for sure. The local timber mill closed down years ago, jobs are scarce and times are tough as witnessed by the number of homes for sale and boarded up stores. The population in the entire borough of Haines is around 2,000 people.</p>

<h3>A Short History</h3>


<p>Haines is named after a woman who donated money to create a mission here to convert the Tlingits, the native population. The Tlingits referred to the area as “the end of the trail,” because of it being the end of their inland trading route. Once the United States bought Alaska from Russia and subsequent land disputes with Canada were settled, Haines became a major military installation that dominated the region and the economy from the turn of the century to just after WW II. The dismantling of what was known as Fort Seward was a blow to the region.</p>

<p><a href="http://blog.lesterpickerphoto.com/wp-content/uploads/2011/08/LAP2222.jpg"><img class="size-medium wp-image-1496 " title="_LAP2222" src="http://blog.lesterpickerphoto.com/wp-content/uploads/2011/08/LAP2222-300x199.jpg" alt="" width="300" height="199"></a></p>

<h3>Haines Today</h3>


<p>The American Bald Eagle Foundation is headquartered here and sponsors the annual eagle festival in November. During the winter months Haines has the highest concentration of bald eagles in the world and attracts lots of nature lovers. Similarly the annual salmon run attracts thousands of visitors. Haines also attracts thousands of adventurers who love outdoor pursuits including kayaking, mountain biking, fishing, canoeing, hunting, camping hiking and photography. A number of outfitters in town cater to that crowd. If you are into any of these sports, I advise you to keep away from the two terrific outfitting stores in town because you’re bound to spend more there than you anticipated.</p>

<p>Accommodations tend to be modest. There are several nice restaurants in town. My favorites were <strong>The Chilkat Bakery &amp; Restaurant </strong>for breakfast and the <strong>Mountain Market</strong>, an organic/alternative market and restaurant for lunch.</p>

<p>Dinners were a mixed bag. On the one hand we had a good dinner at <strong>Mosey’s Cantina</strong>, a Mexican restaurant. <strong>The Bamboo Room and Pioneer Bar</strong> is known for its fresh fish and chips, which were terrific, but its other dinners were mediocre at best. One “Salmon Special” was so awful I had to send it back. The wait staff, however, was exceptionally friendly and efficient.</p>

<p>The one thing that came as a surprise to me was the cost of food here. From groceries to restaurant meals, things are expensive. A fish and chips dinner, for example, is $25, without drinks. However, the portion sizes are huge and easily shared by two.</p>

<h3>Unique Venues</h3>


<p>As you might expect, Haines has some solid and some quirky cultural attractions. First the quirky: how about The Hammer Museum. No, it’s named after a person. This is a museum devoted entirely to hammers!</p>

<p><a href="http://blog.lesterpickerphoto.com/wp-content/uploads/2011/08/LAP1834.jpg"><img class="aligncenter size-medium wp-image-1497" title="_LAP1834" src="http://blog.lesterpickerphoto.com/wp-content/uploads/2011/08/LAP1834-199x300.jpg" alt="" width="199" height="300"></a></p>

<p>There is also the Sheldon Museum &amp; Cultural Center which features local history and native culture.</p>

<p><a href="http://blog.lesterpickerphoto.com/wp-content/uploads/2011/08/LAP1845.jpg"><img class="aligncenter size-medium wp-image-1498" title="_LAP1845" src="http://blog.lesterpickerphoto.com/wp-content/uploads/2011/08/LAP1845-199x300.jpg" alt="" width="199" height="300"></a></p>

<p>The American Bald Eagle Foundation maintains both a museum and rescue center where you can see live bald eagles.</p>

<p>The waterfront area is strikingly picturesque, with ocean and snow-capped mountains in every view.</p>

<p><a href="http://blog.lesterpickerphoto.com/wp-content/uploads/2011/08/LAP1864.jpg"><img class="aligncenter size-medium wp-image-1499" title="_LAP1864" src="http://blog.lesterpickerphoto.com/wp-content/uploads/2011/08/LAP1864-300x199.jpg" alt="" width="300" height="199"></a></p>

<h3>Around Haines</h3>


<p>The views and wildlife attractions around Haines are incredible. Drive a few hundred yards from town in any direction and you’ll feast on eye candy.</p>

<p><a href="http://blog.lesterpickerphoto.com/wp-content/uploads/2011/08/LAP2163.jpg"><img class="aligncenter size-medium wp-image-1500" title="_LAP2163" src="http://blog.lesterpickerphoto.com/wp-content/uploads/2011/08/LAP2163-300x199.jpg" alt="" width="300" height="199"></a></p>

<p>Bald eagles are everywhere, bears roam the roads, forest and shoreline at this time of year, and seals swim upriver to feast on the salmon. We saw black mink, many bird species, and dozens of waterfalls. The weather is chilly and often misty or rainy right now, but if you are the outdoors type, I’d easily recommend Haines as a vacation destination.</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>Okay, let me get this over with before my “friend” Richard Hartmier spills the beans. I sprayed myself with bear spray today. In my defense, it was a teensy spritz and it was done protecting Richard and a tourist… well, kinda. Sorta. Well that’s almost the truth.</p>

<p>Here’s what happened. We were photographing a mother with three cubs that had climbed up the embankment of the Chilkoot River and were now on the road, heading for a group of tourists. So absorbed were we in our work, we did not realize that another bear family was coming up behind us! Some alert tourists yelled toward us and we picked up our tripods and walked behind Richard’s vehicle. We didn’t even have time to get into the vehicle. The bears passed within five feet of us, so I got my bear spray ready and popped off the safety catch, just in case. They passed us with no incident, as we watched each other warily. In my rush to re-set my tripod and photograph them approaching the original family of bears in what could have been a dramatic encounter, my elbow hit the bear spray and psssst!</p>

<p>Bear spray is not a pleasant substance. It is the highest concentration of capsacin- hot pepper spray- imaginable. Loyal readers will remember that a similar incident happened to a friend of mine last week, only his spray was in his pants pocket and inflicted far more pain and suffering. Bear spray burns your lungs and skin, but luckily it only came in slight contact with my hands and came nowhere near my eyes. My consequences involved a ruined photo vest and a late night trip to the laundromat to wash my fleece jacket. Worst of all was the incessant jokes and ribbing I was forced to endure from Richard all day and night and probably for the rest of my life. Yukoners have very little else to entertain themselves, so I don’t mind being the grownup here and humoring the poor bloke. Anyway, that’s my story and I’m sticking to it.</p>

<p><a href="http://blog.lesterpickerphoto.com/wp-content/uploads/2011/08/LAP_5025.jpg"><img class="size-medium wp-image-1478" title="LAP_5025" src="http://blog.lesterpickerphoto.com/wp-content/uploads/2011/08/LAP_5025-300x200.jpg" alt="" width="300" height="200"></a></p>

<p>Now, onto the bears. There were lots of them today and I managed to get some decent shots, although the ones I’m showing you here are quickies. Better images will be forthcoming on my <a href="http://www.lesterpickerphoto.com">gallery website</a>, so stay tuned.The best thing about today was the chance to test out some techniques with my new Nikon 200-400mm VR lens and a 500mm piece of junk that Richard is trying to pawn off on me. We had loads of fun photographing these hulking animals, as they gorged themselves on high protein, high fat salmon in preparation for winter. The cubs you see in the photos are two years old and will stay with their mother for another year or so. You can see in some photos that some of them are tagged for research purposes.</p>

<p><a href="http://blog.lesterpickerphoto.com/wp-content/uploads/2011/08/LAP_4977.jpg"><img class="size-medium wp-image-1479" title="LAP_4977" src="http://blog.lesterpickerphoto.com/wp-content/uploads/2011/08/LAP_4977-300x200.jpg" alt="" width="300" height="200"></a></p>

<p>We’ll continue photographing bears tomorrow in Haines. You can follow my tracks on an interactive map at: <a href="http://share.findmespot.com/shared/faces/viewspots.jsp?glId=0kZSlrkmUT5roDXDQ9VAGrsoTydOkgGEl">http://share.findmespot.com/shared/faces/viewspots.jsp?</a>. You&#8217;ll notice that we are spending concentrated time in one area and staying in one spot for extended periods of time.</p>

<p>Within the next two days I’ll describe this quaint seacoast town and its spectacular mountainous surroundings in some detail.</p>

<p><a href="http://blog.lesterpickerphoto.com/wp-content/uploads/2011/08/LAP_5137.jpg"><img class="size-medium wp-image-1480" title="LAP_5137" src="http://blog.lesterpickerphoto.com/wp-content/uploads/2011/08/LAP_5137-300x200.jpg" alt="" width="300" height="200"></a></p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>Richard Hartmier and I <a href="http://share.findmespot.com/shared/faces/viewspots.jsp?glId=0kZSlrkmUT5roDXDQ9VAGrsoTydOkgGEl">traveled from Whitehorse, Yukon Territory, Canada to Haines, Alaska</a> today, in a car ride punctuated by frequent photo stops. The landscapes were enhanced by low-lying fog, so look for future blogs showcasing some of those images or visit my <a href="http://www.lesterpickerphoto.com">gallery website</a> to see the final cuts.</p>

<p>Driving through the mountain passes, we descended toward the ocean in Haines and set our clocks back an hour. I found the ride a bit difficult due to a cracked rib injury I sustained during my drive up the Dempster Highway last week. Still, we made it to Haines in time for lunch, except we decided instead to just check out the bear situation first. Needless to say, that diversion delayed lunch for about three hours.</p>

<p>No sooner did we hit the bear viewing area that Richard has scouted than we saw a female grizzly with three cubs wading into the Chilkoot river fishing for salmon. This is prime gorging time before the bears settle into their winter sleep (technically, they do not hibernate). Unfortunately for us, but fortunately for the tourists, a large cruise ship was in port and a throng of people crowded the shore viewing the bears. There is no question in our minds that there will eventually be a bad bear-human interaction here and it won&#8217;t be the fault of the bears, who will have to then be killed. Some of the humans were taking downright stupid chances with animals that could kill or maim them in one swat of their powerful claws.</p>

<p><a href="http://blog.lesterpickerphoto.com/wp-content/uploads/2011/08/LAP_4877.jpg"><img class="size-medium wp-image-1469" title="LAP_4877" src="http://blog.lesterpickerphoto.com/wp-content/uploads/2011/08/LAP_4877-300x199.jpg" alt="" width="300" height="199"></a></p>

<p>After lunch we went back for a second shooting session, although lugging around my tripod and telephoto howitzer was painful at times. We did manage to see a second female with two cubs as they fished together on a fishing weir maintained by Native Americans. For those of you unfamiliar with the concept, a weir is a series of poles set into a river to trap fish, a definite plus for hungry bears.</p>

<p><a href="http://blog.lesterpickerphoto.com/wp-content/uploads/2011/08/LAP_4837.jpg"><img class="size-medium wp-image-1470" title="LAP_4837" src="http://blog.lesterpickerphoto.com/wp-content/uploads/2011/08/LAP_4837-300x199.jpg" alt="" width="300" height="199"></a></p>

<p>Minutes later the cubs were successful, having caught a delicious salmon snack, which they shared on the nearby river bank.</p>

<p><a href="http://blog.lesterpickerphoto.com/wp-content/uploads/2011/08/LAP_4853.jpg"><img class="size-medium wp-image-1471" title="LAP_4853" src="http://blog.lesterpickerphoto.com/wp-content/uploads/2011/08/LAP_4853-300x200.jpg" alt="" width="300" height="200"></a></p>

<p>I&#8217;m sure looking forward to tomorrow. The weather promises to be better. Today it was cloudy and drizzly, not really ideal for wildlife images. After a good night&#8217;s rest I hope my rib(s) will improve.I&#8217;ll also give you my impressions of Haines.</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>If you&#8217;ve been following my travels on my <a href="http://share.findmespot.com/shared/faces/viewspots.jsp?glId=0kZSlrkmUT5roDXDQ9VAGrsoTydOkgGEl">SPOT</a> site, you&#8217;ll notice that I left late because I had to do some errands in Whitehorse before Richard Hartmier and I left for Haines, Alaska for bear-gorging-on-salmon photographs. We arrived in time for lunch in Haines Junction, Yukon and planned to scout around for some good images at the entrance to Kluane National Park, but the weather continues to be uncooperative- low light and dull clouds. We did make good use of the time, though, by visiting some of Richard&#8217;s friends who own an adventure outfitting company.</p>

<p>We did manage to find a hidden jewel of a restaurant in Haines Junction called Backerei Cafe, offering organic foods, scrumptious pastries and fresh roasted coffee and specialty teas, a bit of a surprise for such a tiny outpost. Co-owner Jonathon Petersson has put together a menu to fit all palates, from elk burgers to veggie burgers. The menu varies day-to-day. The unassuming restaurant is attached to the Alcan Motor Inn.</p>

<p>Tomorrow starts three days of shooting, rain or shine. Stay tuned.</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>Well, the first part of my Yukon adventure is over, after spending 10 days with five of my closest men friends to celebrate the 25th anniversary of our first meeting. You may have noticed that my GPS is turned off. That&#8217;s because the past 48 hours we have been in and around Whitehorse. I will turn it back on tomorrow, as you&#8217;ll see below.</p>

<h3>Highlights</h3>


<p>There were too many highlights of the RV-ing adventure for me to mention all of them. Of course there were the grizzly and caribou sightings, and the always enjoyable scenery. But the two funniest incidents that stand out for me happened to the same person, who shall remain nameless in the interest of protecting his identity and our friendship.</p>

<p>It seems like this particular man was bitten by the fishing bug while we were on our trip. One morning he awoke at 6:00 AM to fish. Sick of hearing me always remind him, he remembered to take a can of bear spray with him. The only problem was that someone else had put the safety clip on upside down. So, when this unfortunate man bent down to tie his shoes, the can released a goodly spray of bear repellent into his trousers.</p>

<p>Now, the thing about bear repellent is that it is made of the highest concentration of pepper spray imaginable, enough to stop a full-grown grizzly in its tracks. The&#8230; ummm&#8230; part of this man&#8217;s anatomy immediately adjacent to his pocket was thusly affected greatly by the pepper spray. In the pandemonium that followed, this guy dropped his trousers, bear spray and all, faster than Superman and ran full speed into the nearest stream, bears be damned. It might have taken the annual flow of the mighty Yukon River to quiet the burning and there were unconfirmed reports of massive fish kills downstream. But, all&#8217;s well that ends well, although we won&#8217;t know until he arrives home to his wife what the final outcome will be, poor guy. And, needless to say, I cannot mention in this blog what this man&#8217;s new nickname is now.</p>

<h3>Once Is Not Enough</h3>


<p><a href="http://blog.lesterpickerphoto.com/wp-content/uploads/2011/08/LAP1701.jpg"><img class="size-medium wp-image-1454" title="_LAP1701" src="http://blog.lesterpickerphoto.com/wp-content/uploads/2011/08/LAP1701-300x199.jpg" alt="" width="300" height="199"></a></p>

<p>Okay, segue now to about five days later, as we paddled down the Yukon River in our canoes. With this man and his fishing buddy in the rear canoe, we all heard a cry and a whoosh and soon they both were experiencing the famed river&#8217;s hypothermic embrace. Of course, once rescued we had to get these men to a warm, comfortable place. Funny thing about that.</p>

<p><a href="http://blog.lesterpickerphoto.com/wp-content/uploads/2011/08/LAP1731.jpg"><img class="size-medium wp-image-1455" title="_LAP1731" src="http://blog.lesterpickerphoto.com/wp-content/uploads/2011/08/LAP1731-199x300.jpg" alt="" width="199" height="300"></a></p>

<p>Memorable highlights, agreed? By time you read this my friends will all have left Yukon Territory for the Sta</p>

<h3>Lowlights</h3>


<p>Probably the lowest point in our adventure was when the water-line plumbing in one of our RVs broke, making it impossible for those three men to shower, cook, wash dishes or use the bathroom for the rest of the trip, a major inconvenience if there ever was one, since the other RV had to pick up the slack. When we got back, the RV owner agreed that it was a design flaw and that he had personally complained to the manufacturer more than once. Yet he still charged us for the repair, with no credit for the inconvenience. When I told him that we felt that was unfair, he responded a week later with a 1,205-word rant about how HE felt unfairly treated! And that was after he and his wife were paid more than $6,500! Go figure.</p>

<p>My suggestion is that you rent from one of the larger and more reputable RV places like Fraserway or Canadream or Cruise Canada. I&#8217;ll have more to say about traveling with an RV in a later blog.</p>

<p>Tomorrow I&#8217;m off with my good photo buddy, <a href="http://www.hartmier.com">Richard Hartmier</a>, as we travel to Haines, Alaska to photograph grizzlies feeding on the annual salmon run. Man, am I excited about that shoot! Then we come back to Yukon for some Northern Lights images and scenics. I&#8217;ll have my GPS on, so you can visit my site to follow my trip live right <a href="http://share.findmespot.com/shared/faces/viewspots.jsp?glId=0kZSlrkmUT5roDXDQ9VAGrsoTydOkgGEl">HERE</a>.</p>

<p>Until then, wishing you all good travels. And don&#8217;t worry, I&#8217;ll have my bear spray with me!!?</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>I’ve been photographing for a bunch of years now and I’m going to share with you the most complex, difficult and contorted shooting environment in the entire universe (and perhaps some alternate ones, as well. That would be trying to do photography while traveling with friends and/or relatives.</p>

<p><a href="http://blog.lesterpickerphoto.com/wp-content/uploads/2011/08/LesterPicker_sandhillcranesYukon_landscape.jpg-1-of-1.jpg"><img class="size-medium wp-image-1448" title="LesterPicker_sandhillcranesYukon_landscape.jpg 1 of 1" src="http://blog.lesterpickerphoto.com/wp-content/uploads/2011/08/LesterPicker_sandhillcranesYukon_landscape.jpg-1-of-1-300x200.jpg" alt="" width="300" height="200"></a></p>

<p>Between the categories of Between-a-Rock-and-a-Hard-Place and I-Can’t-Win-For-Trying lies attempting to get decent photographs while with a group of friends/relatives (okay, wife to be precise). Here’s the scenario:</p>

<p>You come around a bend in your car and spy a gorgeous scenic. The clouds could not be more perfect, the sun is lighting up the far ridge, and some wild mountain goats graze contentedly in the foreground. Everyone oohs and aahs. So, you pull over and everyone gets out. You pop the trunk and take out your tripod, mount your camera on it, screw in your polarizer and get your graduated neutral density filter ready. Oh, you say to yourself as you close the trunk, and reopen it to get your cable release. As you come out from behind the car, you see everyone else in your party opening the car doors, ready to leave.  Sounding familiar?</p>

<p>Now you start to set up your shot. You can feel the daggers penetrating your back. The windows roll down.</p>

<p>“Will it take much longer, honey?”</p>

<p>“What the hell is taking so long? I just pull out my little camera here and take a quick shot. What’s all the fuss?”</p>

<p>In five minutes the horn beeps. I won’t print here what comes to your mind, but you pack up and leave. Familiar now?</p>

<p>I am writing this during a rare alone break while traveling the Yukon and North West Territories of Canada’s glorious wilderness with five of my buddies. Don’t get me wrong, I’m having a ball with these close friends of 25 years. But doing any serious photography? Fuggedaboutit!</p>

<p>I say this having won the wife-of-a-photographer contest. My wife is a saint when it comes to waiting for me to create an image. Lots of waiting. L-o-n-g waits. Waits in rain; waits in snow; waits sweating under a scalding sun. She and I have learned a few things about traveling and photographing, some of which I’d like to share with you here. Of course, I welcome how you and a spouse or friend or group of friends have solved this thorny issue.</p>

<ol>
<li>Be considerate. Civility is in short supply nowadays. So let’s all agree to be civil and courteous to one another as we work out our own way to fairly divvy up the touring and photography time slots.</li>
    <li>Get a life. While your man or woman is photographing, find something else to do that will occupy your time, preferably away from the photographer. My wife, for example, dabbles in her own photography (one of her photos was selected for a calendar). She also sketches and later turns the sketch into top-notch art.</li>
    <li>Negotiate an agreement. Let your companion(s) know about your commitment to photography in advance. Then come to an agreement as to what you would like to get out of the trip photographically, when you guarantee you will not take pictures, etc.</li>
    <li>Research in advance. Knowing what kinds of images you would like to create, and of  which iconic scenes, will go a long way to reducing your photographic anxiety. It will also help you to be prepared, so you can be efficient once on site.</li>
    <li>Celebrate the work of others. Look, your friends may not take prizewinning images, but that does not mean they won’t derive just as much enjoyment from them. Encourage their efforts, praise their work, offer tips and suggestions&#8230; if they want them.</li>
    <li>Choose diversity. Arrange to visit places that have a bevy of activities for the whole group. While you’re out photographing the others can be doing their own thing.</li>
    <li>Go alone. One thing is for sure. If you go someplace alone you will have all the time you want for photography.</li>
</ol>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>I&#8217;m sitting in the Eagle Plains Hotel and Restaurant lobby as I create this blog. After our disappointment regarding Tuktoyaktuk, we headed back south toward Dawson City. Our group was excited to see three very large grizzlies, including one male that was about the biggest grizzly I&#8217;ve ever seen. We also saw seven caribou. All in all it was quite a trip segment.</p>

<p><a href="http://blog.lesterpickerphoto.com/wp-content/uploads/2011/08/LAP_4346.jpg"><img class="size-medium wp-image-1442" title="LAP_4346" src="http://blog.lesterpickerphoto.com/wp-content/uploads/2011/08/LAP_4346-200x300.jpg" alt="" width="200" height="300"></a></p>

<p>The skies continue to plague us, although we did get a sustained sunny period en route here.  The tundra is an incredible sight when the sun plays on the golden shrubs, grasses and lichens. The land is so vast and the gentle mountains add texture to the magical landscapes.</p>

<p>We will continue south all day tomorrow, covering perhaps 150 miles, if we are lucky and the good weather holds. Driving on the Dempster is difficult, with its many potholes and ridges and one needs to slow down whenever a vehicle approaches from the opposite direction so as to minimize rock damage to windshields. Fortunately, we pass very few vehicles. One one stretch last night we drove for 4 hours and did not pass one vehicle. We stopped at a pullout and spent the night. Sleeping was tough since it was still light outside at midnight. Such is life in the far north.</p>

<p>More to come.</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>Sad to say, our flight to Tuktoyaktuk was cancelled. We waited for the skies to clear from 8:30 AM to 1:30 PM. First we were delayed by heavy fog in Inuvik. Then it was 30 mph winds and rain in Tuk. At 1:30 the Aklak Air service agent came out to tell us we were last Saturday’s dinner.</p>

<p><a href="http://blog.lesterpickerphoto.com/wp-content/uploads/2011/08/Unknown.jpeg"><img class="size-full wp-image-1439" title="Unknown" src="http://blog.lesterpickerphoto.com/wp-content/uploads/2011/08/Unknown.jpeg" alt="" width="205" height="127"></a></p>

<p>We weren’t able to reschedule due to a lack of seats on the next day’s flights so, reluctantly we left the airport knowing that our dip in the frigid waters of the Arctic Ocean will remain on my bucket list. Note I say “my” bucket list. I think my friends are somewhat relieved… okay, very relieved.</p>

<p>In an attempt to make lemonade, the cancellation will give us more time on the Dempster Highway as we drive back to Dawson City and then on to Whitehorse. On the way up here we did manage to see a juvenile grizzly walking down the road, but no caribou… yet. Hopefully the weather will be more cooperative for landscape and wildlife photography.</p>

<p>Hope you are all having a good end to summer.</p>
