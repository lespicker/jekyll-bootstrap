<p><strong>The Outer Banks</strong></p>

<p>By Lester Picker</p>

<p>With more than 300 miles of coastline, the Outer Banks has stretches of sand that are consistently rated among the top beaches in the world. Whether you crave an active water vacation or a spiritually recharging barefoot walk along empty beaches, the Outer Banks has it all.</p>

<p>The Outer Banks is just a 6- or 7-hour drive from Baltimore. The sense of place can change markedly from one milepost to another. For a family with school-age children, the beaches from Duck to Nag’s Head pulse with activity. The hubbub comes with choices of restaurants, amusement rides, museums, events and water activities galore.</p>

<p><a href="http://blog.lesterpickerphoto.com/wp-content/uploads/2010/07/outerbanks_2007-10-06_2%C2%A9LesterPicker.jpg"><img class="size-medium wp-image-280" title="outerbanks_2007-10-06_2©LesterPicker" src="http://blog.lesterpickerphoto.com/wp-content/uploads/2010/07/outerbanks_2007-10-06_2%C2%A9LesterPicker-234x300.jpg" alt="" width="234" height="300"></a></p>

<p>Those who crave a quieter time could hardly do better than to spend time along Cape Hatteras National Seashore, where contemplative walks are measured in miles of undeveloped seashore. Nature lovers, especially birders, have much to indulge their passion. The National Seashore offers shelter to millions of migratory and endemic birds. Shell collectors can spend days sifting through the treasures that the oceans deposit at their feet.</p>

<p>Marylanders should note that, unlike Ocean city, the Outer Banks go on and on and on. The stretch from the Virginia border to Cape Hatteras alone is 100 miles. Here are some options for places to stay, eat and recreate, sprinkled along that beach route.</p>

<p><strong>Lodging</strong></p>

<p>There is no shortage of hotels along the Outer Banks. Most of the major chains are  represented. The trick is booking early for choice locations (think beachfront) and prices.</p>

<p><strong>Hilton Garden Inn</strong>, 5353 North Virginia Dare Trail, Kitty Hawk, 252-261-1290, <a href="http://www.hiltongardeninn.com">www.hiltongardeninn.com</a> (then enter Kitty Hawk, NC).</p>

<p><strong>Maui</strong></p>

<p>by Lester Picker</p>

<p>I love Hawaii. Few destinations in the world offer as much variety, as much depth and breadth of experience, as much visual pleasure, as do the Hawaiian islands. Born of cataclysm in the middle of the Pacific Ocean a million or so years ago, the islands today offer so many options, I always threaten to stay. When my vacations there wind down, I find my To-Do list already growing for the next visit. There are the hikes near the volcano that I still want to take on the Big Island of Hawaii, the shops I want to visit on Oahu, the breathtaking walks along Kauai’s Napali coast. But, of all the Hawaiian islands, I find myself most irresistibly drawn back to Maui.</p>

<p><a href="http://blog.lesterpickerphoto.com/wp-content/uploads/2010/07/Maui_2009-02-17_1%C2%A9LesterPicker.jpg"><img class="size-medium wp-image-290" title="Maui_2009-02-17_1©LesterPicker" src="http://blog.lesterpickerphoto.com/wp-content/uploads/2010/07/Maui_2009-02-17_1%C2%A9LesterPicker-300x184.jpg" alt="" width="300" height="184"></a></p>

<p><strong>An Island of Contrasts</strong></p>

<p>Dwarfed by its larger sister, Hawaii - known as the “Big island” - Maui is the second largest island in the chain. But what it lacks in size it more than makes up for in variety. I love being able to drive from an upscale, urban mall to a 400-foot, wilderness waterfall in little more than an hour.</p>

<p>Maui is roughly 45 miles long by 30 miles wide at its widest point. But within that territory are ten thousand foot elevation changes, desert areas, tropical rain forests and endless seacoast. Rainfall on the northwest side of the island, within the West Maui Forest Reserve, averages more than 300 inches a year! Yet drive 45-minutes down the coast to Wailea and rainfall averages a desert-like 16 inches a year.</p>

<p>Shopping on Maui is nothing short of world class, with major retailers well represented and big-box stores abundant. But, get real. You’re not going to Maui to shop at Wal-Mart. One of the joys of shopping on Maui is in exploring its small towns, walking up and down quaint streets and shopping the one-of-a-kind boutique arts and crafts stores.</p>

<p>And then there are Maui’s restaurants. The island is a virtual smorgasbord of foods, from the typical fast food joints to 5-star gourmet experiences from the likes of Master Chef Wolfgang Puck (<em>Spago</em> Restaurant at The Four Seasons Resort in Waimea). In short, Maui offers everything I could possibly want, comfortably wrapped in a manageable island setting.</p>

<p><strong>Getting Around</strong></p>

<p>Despite commercial developments over the past few decades, Maui’s shoreline is still mostly undeveloped, much of it forever so. Huge tracts of land are either state or national parkland. Vistas are expansive, the clouds are beautiful and every few miles you’ll want to jump out to take pictures. That is why I find driving on Maui to be mostly a joy.</p>

<p>Notice I say “mostly.” There are trouble spots, like on a recent weekend evening when my wife and I tried to drive to Lahaina to meet a couple of friends for dinner. As they say, fuggedaboudit! Because of congestion on the narrow road, we were 45-minutes late. But thanks to the laid-back island attitude, the maitre de sat us promptly. There are also the typical minor traffic backups in and around popular shopping areas, like Kahului’s malls.</p>

<p><a href="http://blog.lesterpickerphoto.com/wp-content/uploads/2010/07/Maui_2009-02-24_3%C2%A9LesterPicker.jpg"><img class="size-medium wp-image-288" title="Maui_2009-02-24_3©LesterPicker" src="http://blog.lesterpickerphoto.com/wp-content/uploads/2010/07/Maui_2009-02-24_3%C2%A9LesterPicker-300x200.jpg" alt="" width="300" height="200"></a></p>

<p>But for me, there are few drives in the world that can compete with the famous (or infamous) Road to Hana, a mostly elevated, sometimes hair-raising 55-mile drive along the coast with non-stop, stunning views of ocean, lava fields and tropical forest. No matter what the guidebooks estimate the drive should take, I literally double that so I have time to stop frequently, take photos, and hike closer to the many waterfalls and crashing ocean waves I pass. If you’re afraid of heights, be warned. At points along this drive you may have to peel your fingers off the steering wheel. A simple solution I employ is to drive southeast from Kahului. That way I stay on the inside lane and stretch my supply of anti-anxiety meds.</p>

<p>Another of my favorite drives is the 38-mile inland route to the tiny town of Kula. I savor the commanding views of the island that open up as we climb 10,000 feet toward the Haleakala volcano. My wife and I always plan extra time to stop at the roadside fruit stands. Like their counterparts throughout the islands, I guarantee you will never find fresher or tastier fresh fruits anywhere. My personal favorites are Maui’s tiny apple bananas, which have a distinct, crisp taste. Of course, Maui’s sweet pineapples are world renowned, but the mangoes and papayas are every bit as succulent.</p>

<p>This past winter, we took an early morning drive to the <em>Kula Lodge</em>, a Bed &amp; Breakfast near Haleakala National Park that boasts a sweeping coastal view encompassing Wailea, Kihei and (almost) Lahaina. We ate a delectable breakfast of eggs benedict and their signature home fries, chased by cup after cup of steaming, black Kona coffee, all the while soaking in the view through the oversized windows. When we were done, we ambled through the Lodge’s colorful wildflower gardens and their lush tropical fruit trees.</p>

<p>One final hint about driving on Maui. Whatever the season, take along a jacket or rain parka. As you pass from jungle to open areas, valleys to mountaintops, the weather can change quickly, with wind chill drops of as much as thirty degrees.</p>

<p><strong>The Active Lifestyle</strong></p>

<p>On our third day on Maui, we started out in the early morning and took the Road to Hana in time to get to the Ohe’o Gulch parking area before lunch. From there we hiked to the picturesque, 400-foot tall Waimoku waterfall, a moderate, but long hike that winds through a sacred bamboo forest. There is simply no way to describe how dense the tree growth here is. A small group of teens hiked behind us and even they were awed into silence once we entered the depths of this magnificent preserve. All around us bamboo trees towered, blocking out the sun and creaking and groaning each time the ocean breezes blew across the mountain.</p>

<p>We arrived at the towering waterfall in time for a leisurely lunch, admiring the cascading falls and the mini-rainbows they produced. Refreshed, we headed back for the car. But a  chance encounter with a friendly local couple rewarded us with one of the highlights of our visit. They steered us past a fork in the path, where a sign warned of dangerous conditions. They assured us that if we were cautious, we would be in for a treat. Carefully, we edged past the sign and within a hundred yards, we came upon a series of pools that magically originated out of the rock face of the mountain, each one as placid and inviting as the next. We were stunned by their beauty, protected as they were by a heavy forest canopy. As we approached the last pool, we noticed that it cascaded over a precipice. We approached very cautiously and in a few steps we were stunned to see that we literally stood atop a 200-foot waterfall. Below us lay the most verdant valley we have ever seen. Our eyes soaked in the stunning view, with the Pacific Ocean in the distance. Yet another series of waterfalls plunged down the side of the valley to our left. With no one else around, it felt like a scene from prehistoric times.</p>

<p>From serious climbs to leisurely strolls, Maui is hiker heaven. On the sixth day of our stay, we both felt tired, so we took a relaxed hike in Iao Valley State Park, conveniently located near the narrowest part of the island and easily accessible from most population centers. We decided to hike to the Iao Needle, a natural spire that juts up from the valley floor and was considered a sacred site by the ancient Hawaiians. It was also the site of major battles between tribal rivals and there are burial grounds within the park that add to its religious significance.</p>

<p>Beyond hiking, the active lifestyle reigns supreme on Maui. Horseback riding, surfing, bicycling, golf, hang-gliding, parasailing, kayaking and SCUBA diving adventures can be found all over the island. Adventure outfitters are readily available for those who want to avoid the hassles of arranging all the details themselves.</p>

<p><strong>Whale of a Time</strong></p>

<p>Probably the most sought-after Maui experience for vacationers is whale watching. And no wonder. Every year, family groups of humpback whales come to the Hawaiian islands to bask in the warm waters, feeding on the abundant krill and seemingly vacationing themselves. Young whales frolic with each other, rolling over and over, while their parents perform aerial acrobatics as they rocket from the water.</p>

<p>My wife and I chose a wonderful sunset whale watching trip out of the harbor in Ma’alaea Bay. If it’s your first whale watching excursion, I recommend booking a trip through the Pacific Whale Foundation, although nearly every boat captain can place you alongside whales during the December through May season. The Foundation is a non-profit organization and part of the proceeds fund whale research.</p>

<p>On this particular evening, with plenty of sunlight still left, we were treated to more than a dozen whales breaching out of the water, landing with thunderous splashes and huge plumes of water. We got close enough to one family group to hear them exhaling through their blowholes, the mists lingering around the boat. With the sun setting, we headed back to the dock, highly satisfied with all our sightings. Suddenly, there was a massive explosion from the water just 100 yards to our left and two adult females breached in unison, a spectacular finale to a perfect cruise.</p>

<p>After our cruise we drove 20 minutes to Lahaina, which is one of our favorite haunts on Maui. Lahaina is an old whaling village, a true irony on an island that draws considerable revenue from preserving whale habitat and serving up whales nowadays through binoculars and cameras. Today Lahaina is a tourist paradise, chock full of unique boutiques and great restaurants.</p>

<p>One of Lahaina’s most famous attractions is its banyan tree, the largest in the state. It’s aerial roots have extended every which way for the length of a city block, so that it is perennially shady under its massive branches. It is an incredible sight, well worth seeing. But, heed my warning. Do not stroll under its branches after nightfall. The humongous tree is home to literally thousands of birds. Their collective chattering when they return each evening is nearly deafening. As my wife and I ate dinner directly across the street one night, two young couples walking under its canopy emerged nearly white-haired, their clothing similarly splattered.</p>

<p>Lahaina has more than its share of good restaurants. One of them, <em>Pacifico</em>, is right on the beach and prides itself in fresh caught seafood, exquisitely prepared by their chef. On our last night in Lahaina, we made reservations for an hour before sunset and sipped an excellent wine as we watched the sun sink into the Pacific Ocean.</p>

<p>After dinner, we strolled down Front Street, popping into the various galleries and arts and crafts stores. We couldn’t resist a macadamia nut ice cream cone at <em>Lappert’s</em>, one of our favorite Maui rituals.</p>

<p><strong>On the Beach</strong></p>

<p><a href="http://blog.lesterpickerphoto.com/wp-content/uploads/2010/07/Maui_2009-02-18_2%C2%A9LesterPicker.jpg"><img class="alignright size-medium wp-image-289" title="Maui_2009-02-18_2©LesterPicker" src="http://blog.lesterpickerphoto.com/wp-content/uploads/2010/07/Maui_2009-02-18_2%C2%A9LesterPicker-199x300.jpg" alt="" width="199" height="300"></a>Between hiking, whale watching and scenic driving, we sometimes have to schedule beach time when we’re in Maui, which is a little nuts since Maui’s beaches are consistently rated among the Top Ten on world lists. All beaches in Hawaii are accessible by the public, even those in front of upscale beach resorts. Most of Maui’s coastline is still rugged and inaccessible. But, if the beach is sandy and you can get to it, you can use it.</p>

<p>One of the most incredible things about Maui’s beaches is that you can often whale watch right from your beach chair. The water immediately off shore is deep, so whales tend to hug the coast in their search for food and protected play areas. We always bring along binoculars and scan for spouts, then follow their antics. If you keep your eyes open as you drive, you will often see cars pulled off the road on bluffs, where people gather to whale-watch.</p>

<p>Snorkeling, a big tourist pastime should only be attempted from recommended beaches. Currents and wave action can be severe in places. But, given the right beach, snorkeling is incredibly inviting. I remember the very first time I dived in Maui’s waters. My host, a marine biologist, apologized for the poor underwater visibility that day, which was at least one hundred feet, since I could see our anchor clearly on the bottom. Back East, I’d be happy with twenty feet visibility.</p>

<p>Rather than carry diving equipment from the mainland, my wife and I rent from one of the many dive shops around the island. Daily and weekly rental fees are quite reasonable due to the intense competition among shops.</p>

<p>But, let’s face it, it’s no secret why any of us really go to the beach. To that end Maui offers up the world’s best beach napping experience. Slather on the sunscreen, pull your cap over your eyes, take a deep breath of the salt air and lay back. Maui’s rolling waves and gentle tropical breezes will do the rest.</p>

I’ve been so damned busy over the last 30+ years teaching others how to improve their photography, I’ve never actually taken a photographic workshop as a participant. I do follow the emerging trends, new techniques, and the latest-greatest advances in equipment. But most of all I pay attention to the younger artists who are not resigned to old ways of doing things. They are the engines that drive our craft forward.</p>

<h3>Darwin Wiggett</h3>


<p><a href="http://blog.lesterpickerphoto.com/wp-content/uploads/2010/07/biophoto.jpg"><img class="size-full wp-image-231 " title="biophoto" src="http://blog.lesterpickerphoto.com/wp-content/uploads/2010/07/biophoto.jpg" alt="" width="240" height="160"></a></p>

<p>One of those artists I follow and admire greatly is Darwin Wiggett, a talented Canadian pro whose career I have watched evolve over the past decade. Darwin is a passionate advocate of our craft. He has a unique and creative vision – and an absolute mastery of his equipment – that is reflected in his art. Just take a look at his website to see what I mean (<a href="http://www.darwinwiggett.com">www.darwinwiggett.com</a>).</p>

<p>So, finally, after four decades of photography, I succumbed and enrolled in one of Darwin’s Canadian Rockies workshops. Now that I’m a graduate, all I can say is “Wow!”</p>

<p><a href="http://blog.lesterpickerphoto.com/wp-content/uploads/2010/07/glance_aurumlodge.jpg"><img class="size-full wp-image-238 " title="glance_aurumlodge" src="http://blog.lesterpickerphoto.com/wp-content/uploads/2010/07/glance_aurumlodge.jpg" alt="" width="172" height="129"></a></p>

<p>Darwin is a master, yet his workshops aren’t lecture-filled napfests. Within moments of arriving at eco-friendly Aurum Lodge (<a href="http://www.aurumlodge.com">www.aurumlodge.com</a>), Alan and Madeleine Ernst‘s inviting home away from home, you are immersed in a magical world of nature and landscape photography. There are no distractions, just pure unadulterated photo joy.</p>

<h3>Darwin&#8217;s Typical Workshop Day</h3>


<p>Our small group ranged from rank amateurs to successful pros, men and women, whose sole objective was to learn from Darwin and improve their craft. The morning after we arrived we awoke at 4:00 AM, to ensure that we were in place for sunrise, a pattern that was repeated every day for the duration of the 5-day experience. For the next 16 hours we drove from site to site, photographing some of the most spectacular landscapes on Earth.</p>

<p><a href="http://blog.lesterpickerphoto.com/wp-content/uploads/2010/07/LesterPicker_BanffNationalPark_landscape.jpg-1-of-1.jpg"><img class="size-medium wp-image-242 " title="LesterPicker_BanffNationalPark_landscape.jpg 1 of 1" src="http://blog.lesterpickerphoto.com/wp-content/uploads/2010/07/LesterPicker_BanffNationalPark_landscape.jpg-1-of-1-300x199.jpg" alt="" width="300" height="199"></a></p>

<p><a href="http://blog.lesterpickerphoto.com/wp-content/uploads/2010/07/StickInTheMud1.jpg"><img class="size-medium wp-image-243 " title="StickInTheMud" src="http://blog.lesterpickerphoto.com/wp-content/uploads/2010/07/StickInTheMud1-300x200.jpg" alt="" width="180" height="120"></a></p>

<p>Sometimes we’d spend 2 hours in one spot, other times perhaps 30 minutes, but suffice it to say it was never quite enough, at least for me. Except for the day I stepped into muddy quicksand at the edge of a remote, freezing cold, sulfurous-smelling pond. I quickly sank up to my thighs and had visions of being swallowed up whole. Fortunately Darwin and one of the other participants, Dawn Traverse, saw me take the plunge and rescued my camera (first) and me (second). The  bad news for me was I had to deal with being wet the rest of the day. Even worse, my fellow work-shoppers had to deal with the smell.</p>

<p>One of the things I appreciated most about Darwin’s style is that he is not intrusive. If any of us had questions, he shared his knowledge freely and in sufficient depth to satisfy beginner to expert. If we were all absorbed in the photographic moment, we might observe Darwin off somewhere taking his own images, putting into practice his emphasis on strong foreground elements, for example</p>

<p>Evenings- what little there was of evenings when you’re getting up at 4:00 and shooting for 16 hours- were spent immersed in wide-ranging conversation, albeit mostly about photography. Darwin sets the tone and everyone was supportive of each other’s efforts.</p>

<h3>Learning From Photo Workshops</h3>


<p>The last night we either showed our colleagues some of our images or asked for critiques or perhaps brought a few chosen images to showcase our work. By then we had bonded and critiques were well-intended and well-received.</p>

<p>So, I’ve changed my tune about workshops. I learned a great deal just by observing Darwin’s techniques and sharing his passion for his craft. That alone has energized my work. I also had an opportunity to visit some iconic as well as little known locations in the Canadian Rockies, each one spectacular in its own right. I also enjoyed and benefitted from the enthusiasm, dedication and knowledge-base of my fellow participants. The bottom line is I can’t wait to try another workshop.</p>

<p><em>“I am convinced that there is no air in the world like the air of Maine.”</em></p>

<ul>
<li>Mrs. John D. Rockefeller writing from Bar Harbor in 1944</li>
</ul>


<p><strong>Bar Harbor </strong>by Lester Picker</p>

<p>Bar Harbor, the hub of Mount Desert Island, is a sleepy island community in Frenchman’s Bay for 8 months of the year, with a population of just 2,600.  But, from June through September, the island is host to some 4 million visitors, who come to take in the sights, sounds, tastes and ocean smells of Acadia National Park, which occupies the majority of the island.</p>

<p><a href="http://blog.lesterpickerphoto.com/wp-content/uploads/2010/07/Maine-2009-Longpond-hdr.jpg"><img class="size-medium wp-image-274" title="Maine 2009-Longpond-hdr" src="http://blog.lesterpickerphoto.com/wp-content/uploads/2010/07/Maine-2009-Longpond-hdr-199x300.jpg" alt="" width="199" height="300"></a></p>

<p>Amazingly, only a tiny percentage of visitors ventures off the well-worn roads to take advantage of the eco-tourism this island paradise offers, according to National Park officials.  The spectacular beauty and ecological abundance of the Maine coast makes Bar Harbor the ideal base for the kind of hiking, biking, canoeing and kayaking, that enables the entire family to learn first-hand about our natural world.</p>

<p><strong><em>What To Do</em></strong></p>

<p><strong><em>Whale Watching</em></strong>.  Each year the whales return, playing in their family pods and fattening up on the abundance of sea life just offshore. Four separate whale-watching boats make Bar Harbor their home, plying the waters of Frenchman’s Bay.  For four hours you’ll ooh and aah alongside frolicking Humpbacks, Fin, Right and Minke whales, some of them eighty feet long and breaching just yards from the ship.</p>

<p>Dozens of sightings are the norm from June through mid-October, and an experienced naturalist interprets events for you.  A videographer accompanies many trips, so you can purchase a lifetime of memories of your family amidst whales and the glory of Downeast Maine islands.  All boats offer money-back or exchange-ticket guarantees if no whales are sighted.  If you are prone to sea-sickness, be sure to take medication prior to departing, as seas can sometimes be choppy.</p>

<p>In May and June, there is only one trip a day, seven days a week.  In July, August and September, there are 3 trips a day, seven days a week.  The trip lasts approximately 4-hours.</p>

<p>From the Bar Harbor town pier, take the 105 foot <em>Whale Watcher</em>, a modern, comfortable passenger cruiser, with 360 degree decks designed for optimum viewing (contact Whale Watcher, Inc., 1 West Street, Bar Harbor, ME  04609: 207-288-3322).  Or, try the 112 foot <em>Friendship V, </em>the<em> </em>brand new, jet-powered catamaran leaving from the Blue Nose Ferry Terminal (contact Bar Harbor Whale Watch Co., 39 Cottage Street, Bar Harbor, ME  04609: 207-288-2386).  The 94 foot <em>Acadian Whale Watcher</em> leaves from the Holiday Inn SunSpree Resort pier, located next to the Blue Nose Ferry Terminal (contact Acadian Whale Watcher Co., Route 3, Bar Harbor, ME 04609: 207-288-9794).  Finally, the XX foot <em>Sea Bird Watcher</em> leaves from its West Street pier near the town pier (contact Sea Bird Watcher Co., 52 West Street, Bar Harbor, ME  04609: 207-288-2025).</p>

<p><strong><em>Nature Cruise</em></strong>.  If chasing whales isn’t your cup of tea, or you have less time available, try the delightful one or two-hour sunset nature cruises offered by all four whale-watching companies.  As you cruise among the rugged islands of Frenchman’s Bay, the kids will be delighted by close-up views of seals, harbor porpoises, puffins, ospreys, eagles and other wildlife in their natural environment.  Trained naturalists accompany these cruises, patiently answering all questions. Bring your camera and wear warm clothes.  Even on warm summer days it is commonly 20 degrees cooler on Maine waters.</p>

<p><strong><em>Sea Kayaking</em></strong>.  There simply can’t be a better way to explore Maine’s waters than by kayak.  You’re seated low in the water, with a seal’s eye view of the world around you.  Best of all, kayaks are more stable than canoes and easier to maneuver.</p>

<p><a href="http://blog.lesterpickerphoto.com/wp-content/uploads/2010/07/othellomtns1-1.jpg"><img class="size-medium wp-image-270" title="Maine coast" src="http://blog.lesterpickerphoto.com/wp-content/uploads/2010/07/othellomtns1-1-300x199.jpg" alt="" width="300" height="199"></a></p>

<p>All Bar Harbor companies offer trips for novices, families, and experienced kayakers, including half-day, full-day and multi-day tours, with experienced guides.  In a typical half-day tour for beginners, you’ll start out near the Bar Harbor town pier and receive basic instruction.  In no time, the naturalist-guides are leading your group from island to island, among the dozens of picturesque islands in sight of Bar Harbor.  Be prepared to see eagles, ospreys, seals and, if you’re lucky, a rare puffin or two.</p>

<p>Contact Coastal Kayaking Tours, Inc., 48 Cottage Street, Bar Harbor, ME  04609: 207-288-9605;  National Park Sea Kayak Tours, Inc., 137 Cottage Street, Bar Harbor, ME  04609: 207-288-0342; or Bar Harbor Bicycle and Kayak Shop, 141 Cottage Street, Bar Harbor, ME  04609: 207-288-3886.</p>

<p><strong><em>Bicycling</em></strong>.  Forget any preconceived notions about biking when you visit Bar Harbor.  You won’t have to worry about dangerous roads, noxious fumes, or sleazy scenery. Rent state-of-the-art bikes from one of the many bike shops in town and in five minutes you are cruising along the famous Carriage Paths in Acadia National Park.  Built at the turn of the century with funding from the Rockefeller family, these well groomed marvels of engineering wind around the unimagined beauty of Eagle Lake and Jordan Pond, past waterfalls, around mountains and through dense forest.  No cars are allowed on the 57 miles of Carriage Paths, so it’s truly a family haven.  Stop and have a picnic, or cool off under a waterfall at the entrance to the Deer Brook Trail on Sargent Mountain.</p>

<p>All bike shops provide you with safety equipment, bike racks, and a map of how to access the Carriage Paths from town.  They can also arrange to drop off the family by van.</p>

<p>Contact Acadia Bike &amp; Canoe, 48 Cottage Street, Bar Harbor, ME  04609: 207-288-9605; or Bar Harbor Bicycle and Kayak Shop, 141 Cottage Street, Bar Harbor, ME  04609: 207-288-3886.</p>

<p><strong><em>Hiking</em></strong>.  Hiking the peaks and valleys of Acadia National Park is an experience every family will cherish.  Very few of the Park’s millions of annual visitors stray beyond the familiar tourist attractions.  In thirty easy minutes a family can hike to the top of Flying Mountain for a picnic and breathtaking views of Somes Sound, the only true fjord in the eastern United States.  Its deep, blue-green water set among towering cliffs is a photographer’s dream.</p>

<p><a href="http://blog.lesterpickerphoto.com/wp-content/uploads/2010/07/othellomtns1.jpg"><img class="size-medium wp-image-272" title="Acadia NP" src="http://blog.lesterpickerphoto.com/wp-content/uploads/2010/07/othellomtns1-300x199.jpg" alt="" width="300" height="199"></a></p>

<p>More adventurous families might try The Beehive, overlooking Sand Beach, with its narrow paths, steep drops and iron ladders hammered into the cliff face to enable you to climb to a secure landing.  Or, for an all-day, strenuous treat of forests, islands, and ocean vistas, hike the Dorr Mountain granite stairs trail to Cadillac’s summit.  There are dozens of mountains and hundreds of trails to choose from in Acadia.  Just bring along plenty of water.</p>

<p>Park maps are available from Acadia National Park, P.O. Box 177, Bar Harbor, ME  04609: 207-288-3338.  Detailed trail guides, which Park experts recommend if you are hiking into the National Park, are for sale at the National Park Service Visitor Center, and at every bookstore and gift shop in Bar Harbor.</p>

<p>For a special treat, hire a personalized nature guide to show you scenic locations for photography, or to reveal the best birding locations or spots to watch beaver repairing their dams.</p>

<p>Contact Down East Nature Tours, P.O. Box 521, Bar Harbor, ME 04609: 207-288-8128 or Photoscenics, Inc., 566 Church Road, Bangor, ME 04401: 207-942-0021.</p>

<p><strong><em>Where To Stay</em></strong></p>

<p>Accommodations in Bar Harbor range from opulent to modest.  The following are two good examples of the range of accommodations available.  For peak summer season, book at least three months in advance.  Camping is also available, both within the National Park and in private campgrounds outside.</p>

<p>Immediately next to the Bluenose Ferry Terminal sits the Holiday Inn SunSpree Resort, a family-friendly haven with child sitting services and a full-day of children’s activities, 3 restaurants, a whale watching boat, plus all the amenities to satisfy adults, children and teens. Contact the SunSpree Resort at 123 Eden Street, Bar Harbor, ME 04609: 207-288-9723.</p>

<p>For families seeking a quiet retreat with picturesque views, nothing beats the quaint Edgewater Motel &amp; Cottages which, true to their name, sit on the shore at Hull’s Cove, only ten minutes from downtown Bar Harbor.  Look out your cottage window at the working lobster boats and fishing seines, and you’ll swear you’ve gone back 200 years to when current owners David and Fran Bowden’s ancestors originally bought the land.  Rooms range from $49 to $105 per night for a double, depending on season and amenities.  Cottages include dishes, linens and other amenities. Contact the Bowdens, Box 566, Bar Harbor, ME 04609: 207-288-3491.</p>

<p><strong><em>Eating Out</em></strong></p>

<p>After a day of hiking, biking, or just plain sightseeing, Bar Harbor offers a surprisingly wide range of eating choices, from inexpensive lunches to higher priced dining.  Lobster dinners are as endemic as beef dinners in Kansas City, but for out-of-the-ordinary experiences you’ll have to be adventurous.</p>

<p>Start your day with Jordan’s Famous Wild Maine Blueberry Pancakes or Blueberry Muffins at Jordan’s Restaurant on Cottage Street.  This Bar Harbor institution draws both locals and tourists in a comfortable mix that’s easy on the wallet.  Four can eat breakfast for under $30.</p>

<p>Don’t miss out on a rainy-day lunch at the West End Drug Company on Main Street, run by the Gilfillan family since 1917.  Where in today’s modern world, can you sit on bar stools at a luncheonette counter in a turn-of-the-century working pharmacy, and order a kid-pleasing grilled cheese or pb &amp; j sandwich for just two bucks?  And don’t forget to order their old-time chocolate frappe, mixed before your eyes with fresh milk, chocolate ice cream and chocolate syrup.</p>

<p>On selected weeknights, have an early dinner, then take in the Town Band concert on the Village Green at 8:00 PM.  The Norman Rockwell experience will make an indelible mark in your family’s memory lane, as adults sit on the lawn sipping coffee, kids run around the band shell, and the deep-throated sound of the Bluenose ferry echoes through the still Maine night as it leaves Bar Harbor for its overnight cruise to Yarmouth, Nova Scotia.</p>

<p>No visit to Mount Desert Island can be considered complete without “high tea” served at white tables on the lawn at the Jordan Pond House.  Dress ranges from hikers and bikers in shorts to people in sport jackets.  Sitting squarely at the edge of picturesque Jordan Pond, nestled solidly between towering Sargent Mountain and The Bubbles, the Jordan Pond House has been in continuous operation since the 1870s.  Time your bicycle ride around the Carriage Paths or your hike up Sargent Mountain to arrive between 2:30 and 5:30 on a bright, sunny day and enjoy their famous popovers with fresh Maine strawberry jam.  While waiting for your treats, roam their famous wildflower garden along the edges of the building.  It is an eating experience your family will never forget.  Reservations are not required, but to be sure, call 207-276-3316 on the day you plan to visit.</p>

<p><strong><em>Getting to Bar Harbor</em></strong></p>

<p>For those unwilling to make the family car trek all the way to Bar Harbor, major airlines such as Continental and USAir connect to Boston or Bangor, Maine.  From either airport, Colgan Air connects directly to Bar Harbor via small commuter planes.  The Bangor to Bar Harbor run is an hour-long, traffic-free jaunt by car.  Car rentals are available at Bangor and Bar Harbor airports.  Reserve well in advance on Colgan and for car rentals on peak vacation weeks.</p>

<p><strong><em>For More Information</em></strong></p>

<p>Contact the Bar Harbor Chamber of Commerce, P.O. Box 158, Bar Harbor, ME 04609-0158: 207-288-5103.</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>In two weeks time I set off for another adventure, this time back to the Canadian Rockies, a landscape that I dearly love. This time I’ll take my wife and 16-year old granddaughter (God help me!).</p>

<p><a href="http://blog.lesterpickerphoto.com/wp-content/uploads/2010/07/CanadianRockies2009-3032009-10-05.jpg"><img class="size-medium wp-image-205" title="CanadianRockies2009 3032009-10-05" src="http://blog.lesterpickerphoto.com/wp-content/uploads/2010/07/CanadianRockies2009-3032009-10-05-300x199.jpg" alt="" width="300" height="199"></a></p>

<p>Right now I’m up to my eyeballs in prepping for the trip. I have to keep reminding myself that it’s about the journey, not the destination. Whoever thought that one up was definitely not a photojournalist.</p>

<p>Of course the hardest thing about this particular trip is knowing in advance that I’ll have a moody teen on my hands at various times. But Tonya is really a terrific traveler and is developing a traveler’s eye for details that I sometimes miss. She also keeps me in stitches half the time.</p>

<p>Lots of my colleagues … how do I say this delicately?&#8230; prefer not to travel with their wives. I admit that I’m that way, too, when I’m traveling to a dangerous or out of the way location. But Leslie is an asset, a true assistant when I’m working, readying a camera, scanning for interesting compositions, watching out for bears. She’s even carried a 25-pound backpack full of my gear when we hiked down one side of Maui’s Haleakala crater and up the other side, an amazing two-day trek to another world. Not bad for two 60-year olds - but that’s another story.</p>

<p>People ask me what kind of pre-trip planning it takes to do a 2-week (or 4-week) photo trip. Aside from the immense equipment and logistical issues, this one is more of a touristy trip. We’re flying to the other side of the continent to Vancouver. From there we board the Rocky Mountaineer for a two-day rail trip to Jasper, Alberta. We’ve got 4 days to explore Jasper and Banff National Parks (lots of early morning and late evening photo ops), then we’re headed back northwest on Canada’s ViaRail to Prince Rupert, a scenic city on the shores of the Inner Passage. From there we board a ferry for a 15-hour cruise along the Alaska Marine Highway and the eye candy of the Inner Passage to Port Hardy, at the northern tip of Vancouver Island. Hopefully we’ll see whales and bear and eagles along the route. We take a leisurely day to drive along the length of Vancouver Island and then ferry over to British Columbia’s Sunshine Coast, where we’ll visit some very special friends and tour Gibsons and Sechelt, before ferrying back to Vancouver and a flight home. Sounds like the movie  “Planes, Trains, and Automobiles.” I’m counting on our journey not being such a comedy of errors, though.</p>

<p><small><a style="color: #0000ff; text-align: left;" href="http://maps.google.com/maps?f=d&amp;source=embed&amp;saddr=Port+Hardy,+BC+-+Prince+Rupert,+BC&amp;daddr=Port+Hardy,+BC+-+Prince+Rupert,+BC+to:Inland+Island+Hwy%2FNanaimo+Pkwy%2FBC-19+S+to:Stewart+Rd%2FSunshine+Coast+Hwy%2FBC-101+N+to:Cambie+St+to:Trans-Canada+Hwy%2FAB-1+E+to:Icefields+Pkwy%2FAB-93+N+to:54.313319,-130.297852&amp;hl=en&amp;geocode=FShmPAMdvus6-A%3BFbwNBgMdBgRn-A%3BFfZ87gIdxhKc-A%3BFWQf8gIdam2j-A%3BFYCD7wIdgmip-A%3BFUTzEAMdprwS-Q%3BFSqdJgMdDCj2-A%3B&amp;mra=mi&amp;mrcr=6&amp;mrsp=7&amp;sz=8&amp;sll=54.027133,-129.462891&amp;sspn=4.146955,7.646484&amp;ie=UTF8&amp;ll=54.027133,-129.462891&amp;spn=4.146955,7.646484">View Larger Map</a></small>
I hate making all the detailed arrangements that such a complex trip entails. Flights, hotels, motels, trains, car rentals, ferries, lodging. Between emails and phone tag, it can take weeks before the final pieces fall into place. In fact, I’ll make a note to blog about how I go about all this in a future post, so stay tuned!</p>

<p>Oh, yeah. And then there’s the equipment. Do I need extra batteries? Should I order that new lens now in order to get some field practice with it before the trip, or wait until the last minute when I have the money to pay for it and hope for the best?</p>

<p>Believe it or not, one of the biggest pains in the rear for me is deciding which bag to take. If I’m hiking into wilderness areas, I’ve got to travel light. Everything I need is on my 62-year old, increasingly fragile body. I used to think I was the Imelda Marcus of photo bags, until I saw the closet of one of my unnamed colleagues. In this case, I’ll need two bags; one for transporting onto planes, trains, automobiles and ferries and one for hiking once I get there.</p>

<p>Okay, back to work, sorting out which equipment to take. I’ll save that for my next blog.</p>

Right now I’m going through my usual pre-trip crazies deciding what to bring. Actually, the big problem is deciding what not to bring!</p>

<p>You’d think that after 30+ years I’d have this down to a science, and I probably would if the damned field didn’t keep changing every 6 months! New cameras that include functions of 2 other devices (think multiple exposure meters and GPS devices), macro rails, a new 5mm-1,000 mm zoom lens that takes the place of 6 others (hey, I’m just kidding about that one, so please don’t write asking me where I got it). I hate packing!</p>

<p>My photo closet is always a mess. I’m either coming from an assignment or heading off to one, or grabbing a camera and lens to test something that popped into my head. So when I get down to packing I start frustrated and go downhill from there. My wife has learned to give me a minimum 10 feet of clearance when I’m readying for a trip.</p>

<p>As you can see, today I’m packing my wheeled carry-on, made by ThinkTank. I like this bag because it is their international size, meaning it fits either the overhead bin or under seat storage of nearly all airlines, although it pays nowadays to double check before heading to the airport battle zone.</p>

<p>I’ll also take my ThinkTank Rotation 360 bag for hiking the trails. Since my wife and granddaughter will be accompanying me, and our baggage will be seriously curtailed by the realities of the Canadian wilderness, I’ll have to sacrifice certain picture-taking opportunities. I’ll leave my macro equipment, since that takes a long time to set up and use and even though I’ll have two very patient women with me, I don’t want to push it. Also, no extra-long lenses, since my space is limited.</p>

<p>So, after too much agonizing, here’s what made the cut.</p>

<ul>
<li>Nikon D700 (FX) and D300 (DX) bodies</li>
    <li>Nikkor lenses (17-35, 24-70, 70-200, 24mm PCE, 85mm PCE)</li>
    <li>Nikkor 1.4 tele-extender</li>
    <li>Lee graduated soft ND filters (.3, .6, .9)</li>
    <li>Singh-Ray graduated soft ND filters (1,2 and 3)</li>
    <li>Polarizers</li>
    <li>Hoodman LCD screen loop</li>
    <li>Gitzo 3541 tripod with Really Right Stuff BH55 ballhead</li>
    <li>Wimberley gimbal head</li>
    <li>Nikon SB800 flash</li>
    <li>Camera/lens cleaning kit</li>
    <li>12, 8GB storage cards</li>
    <li>500GB Western Digital portable backup drive</li>
    <li>15” MacBook Pro laptop (extra battery, cords, mouse, etc)</li>
    <li>Assorted adapters for the graduated filters</li>
    <li>Waterproof bags</li>
    <li>Tons of batteries</li>
    <li>Chargers</li>
    <li>Digital tape recorder (for notes and interviews)</li>
</ul>


<p>Some of the non-breakable stuff, like adapters, bags and cleaning kit I’ll pack in my checked bag.</p>

<p>Gotta go. Down to the wire now. Did I already mention how I hate packing???</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p style="text-align: center;"><strong>Ten Tips for Images With Impact</strong></p>


<p>One of the most satisfying aspects of traveling is meeting people from different cultures. Some of my fondest memories are of taking time to talk with citizens of countries I visit and learning their customs and beliefs (and their perceptions of America and Americans). I&#8217;ve been invited to dinner by a taxi driver in Cairo and met a man who has become one of my dearest Canadian friends on the bow of a ship in the far North.</p>

<p>I have a feeling that if you asked 100 professional photographers what subject matter is most difficult to photograph, most would say people. To be clear, I’m not speaking of professional portrait or wedding photographers, with their well-designed and lighted studios and automated software. No, I’m referring to travel photographers who want to capture the essence of the cultures they visit, that is, their people.</p>

<p>I’ve been doing professional travel photography for a bunch of years now, and I’m pretty often pleased with the images of people I’ve captured. So the inevitable questions I am asked are  “How do you do it? Do you have any tips for the amateur photographer that you’re willing to share?”</p>

<p>Well, yes, I do have some tips on photographing people and here they are (I welcome comments on this blog and any tips you might have that you would be willing to share with me and my readers).</p>

<ol>
<li><strong>Get Permission</strong>. Pros have it drilled into their heads that they need permission to use an image of a person, any person, for commercial purposes. But for the amateur the situation is different. Or is it?</li>
</ol>


<p>I firmly believe that it is a matter of civility, pure and simple, to ask someone you do not know for permission to photograph him or her. One of my pet peeves is the rude tourist who shoves a camera in the face of someone from a different culture. Of course, if the person is performing that is a different story. But, in my opinion, people have a right to their privacy, and as a photographer I abide by that belief.</p>

<p>Now, permission does not have to be a signed release form. It can be a gesture- holding up your camera, pointing to it and to the subject and shrugging your shoulders as if to ask the question. Or, if you speak the language, just ask.</p>

<p><a href="http://blog.lesterpickerphoto.com/wp-content/uploads/2010/02/people-2-of-7.jpg"><img class="size-medium wp-image-116 " title="Bedouin, Egypt's Eastern desert" src="http://blog.lesterpickerphoto.com/wp-content/uploads/2010/02/people-2-of-7.jpg?w=240" alt="" width="168" height="210"></a></p>

<p>In some countries, I’m thinking of Muslim countries in particular, photographing women without permission can get you in serious trouble. At the very least you owe it to your subject to give her a chance to cover her face.</p>

<p>Sometimes I admit to having photographed a subject surreptitiously, to catch a special moment or expression. In that case I always go up to them afterwards, show them the images and ask if it is okay with them. Usually their smiling faces are their answer.</p>

<p><a href="http://blog.lesterpickerphoto.com/wp-content/uploads/2010/02/people-5-of-7.jpg"><img class="size-medium wp-image-118" src="http://blog.lesterpickerphoto.com/wp-content/uploads/2010/02/people-5-of-7.jpg?w=201" alt="" width="201" height="300"></a></p>

<ol>
<li><p><strong>Get a Picture, Give a Print</strong>. One thing I like to do is either send a print to the person once I get home or else bring one with me on my next visit to the country. In Ecuador, there is a market in Otavalo where I love to spend time photographing. When I go back, I bring prints of my subjects from my last visit and now the people are excited when I return.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Be patient</strong>. One of the tips that I give my students at workshops is to be patient when you photograph people. Often it is only after 10 minutes of shooting that the subject relaxes enough for that unguarded moment.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Get to Know Your Subject</strong>. Perhaps the most enjoyable aspect of travel photography for me is getting to know my subjects, even if only for a short time. The people connection is what makes the travel experience shine. Before you hoist your camera, ask about the craft they might be exhibiting. As a grandfather five times over, I always ask my subjects about their family; it’s the universal glue that binds us. I can nearly guarantee that if you take the time to do this you will be rewarded with warm and poignant images every time.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Shoot Early</strong>. I find that a great time to shoot is early in the morning, even in westernized countries. That is when merchants set up their market stalls, when farmers heave</p></li>
</ol>


<p><a href="http://blog.lesterpickerphoto.com/wp-content/uploads/2010/02/people-6-of-7.jpg"><img class="size-medium wp-image-128 " src="http://blog.lesterpickerphoto.com/wp-content/uploads/2010/02/people-6-of-7.jpg?w=216" alt="" width="216" height="300"></a></p>

<p>their produce from cart to table, when kids scurry to help their parents or scamper away from them. The rising sun casts a warm glow, dust is kicked up highlighting dust motes, and the grittiness of life is front-and-center for your photographic palette.</p>

<p><a href="http://blog.lesterpickerphoto.com/wp-content/uploads/2010/02/people-7-of-7.jpg"><img class="size-medium wp-image-120 " title="Sechelt Coming-of-Age Ceremony" src="http://blog.lesterpickerphoto.com/wp-content/uploads/2010/02/people-7-of-7.jpg?w=200" alt="" width="200" height="300"></a></p>

<ol>
<li><strong>Tell a Story</strong>. I always tell my workshop attendees that when given a choice, shoot a scene tightly. Shooting tight conveys emotion and creates dramatic impact. You do not need the entire person’s body in the image, at times not even the entire face. A child’s face from chin to forehead, lips streaked in chocolate, can be a prize-winner.</li>
</ol>


<p>However, you need to decide before you shoot what the story is that you want to tell. Is it the expressions of toil on a merchants face, or the warm embrace of a nurturing mother? That will determine whether you shoot a tight face shot or a medium telephoto shot of the mother squatting curbside holding her daughter, or a wide angle of a bustling city square. You decide and then fill the pages of your photo book with that story.</p>

<p><a href="http://blog.lesterpickerphoto.com/wp-content/uploads/2010/02/people-3-of-7.jpg"><img class="size-thumbnail wp-image-123 " src="http://blog.lesterpickerphoto.com/wp-content/uploads/2010/02/people-3-of-7.jpg?w=100" alt="" width="100" height="150"></a></p>

<p>7.<strong> Use Flash</strong>. At certain times of the day light is harsh and creates deep shadows that distract from the subject. In many cultures people, especially men, wear wide-brimmed hats that create problems during mid-day hours. The solution in these cases is to use flash to gently fill in the shadows. Yes, pros have elaborate flash systems, but they are often superfluous. You can capture terrific shots using your on-camera, pop-up flash. The secret here is to diffuse the light so it doesn’t appear harsh on the face. There are several after-market products out there that you place over your flash to smooth the light and create pleasing portraits. In a pinch I have used a tissue or a white plastic shopping bag.</p>

<ol>
<li><p><strong>Laugh…a Lot</strong>. Laughter truly is the best medicine and I’ve used it even in uncomfortable travel situations. Just think of how funny you look to a Bedouin or a Sengali fisherman, then lighten up and laugh at yourself. That frame of mind alone will loosen up your subjects and help them be more cooperative.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Move</strong>. When shooting people, move around - talk to them as you do so – and shoot from many different angles. Digital is wonderful. Did the person blink? Just keep shooting. Was the background distracting? Move and keep shooting.</p></li>
</ol>


<p><a href="http://blog.lesterpickerphoto.com/wp-content/uploads/2010/02/people-1-of-7.jpg"><img class="size-medium wp-image-122" src="http://blog.lesterpickerphoto.com/wp-content/uploads/2010/02/people-1-of-7.jpg?w=217" alt="" width="217" height="300"></a></p>

<ol>
<li><strong>Shoot Wide Open</strong>. I say this with a caveat, but if the person is the focus of your image, try opening up the aperture to its maximum (f2.0, 2.8, 3.5 or 4.0). That will blur the background and cause your subject to pop off the frame. That works especially well if the person’s face or dress is able to carry the story. If the story you want to tell includes the context – a dance, the village huts, animals or a spectacular backdrop, then close down the lens (f8, 11 or 16). However, that works best when your subject is close to you, creating a strong foreground element.</li>
</ol>


<p>One last piece of advice&#8230; always remember that you are a good-will ambassador. I prefer to go out of my way to show people of different cultures that we Americans are not so bad after all.</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>“How do you get such saturated colors in the sky?” I am often asked.</p>

<p>“I bet you use fancy filters.”</p>

<p>“Hey, you added those colors in Photoshop, didn’t you?” wink, wink.</p>

<p>Well, my blog friends, I hate to disillusion you, but those colors come from something called sunrise. Pure, natural, 100% organic sunrise. And to capture them you have to get up before sunrise, trek to your preferred location, set up your equipment, pray that it doesn’t rain or cloud over, and then spend the next hour shooting like a maniac.</p>

<p><a rel="lightbox" href="http://blog.lesterpickerphoto.com/wp-content/uploads/2010/01/blog-sunrise-1-of-4.jpg?w=300"><img class="size-medium wp-image-101    " title="Sunrise, Yukon Territory, Canada " src="http://blog.lesterpickerphoto.com/wp-content/uploads/2010/01/blog-sunrise-1-of-4.jpg?w=300" alt="" width="150" height="150"></a></p>

<p>While everyone else is out having a good time during the day, I’m stumbling about in a sleep-deprived daze. Then, around dinnertime, I pull out one solid excuse from my Photographer’s Handbook, and sneak away for another hour of sunset shots. That, in a nutshell, is how a pro photographer captures those magical colors in the sky.</p>

<h3>Sunrise, Sunset: The Magic Hours</h3>


<p>In fact, photographers call the two hours after sunrise and before sunset the ‘magic hours.’ From the perspective of physics that makes sense. When the sun is nearly at the horizon light is penetrating considerably more atmosphere than it does at noon. That slows light down and slower light bends it toward the red end of the visible light spectrum. We humans have a proclivity for reddish colors. They seem ‘warmer’ and more pleasing and peace-inducing to our brains.</p>

<p>Early-Late light also has other properties that tend to transform snapshots into eye-candy. When the sun is low to the horizon it creates longer shadows. That adds depth and texture to images, especially to landscapes.</p>

<p><a href="http://blog.lesterpickerphoto.com/wp-content/uploads/2010/01/blog-sunrise-4-of-4.jpg"><img class="size-medium wp-image-102" title="Sunrise, Alberta, Canada" src="http://blog.lesterpickerphoto.com/wp-content/uploads/2010/01/blog-sunrise-4-of-4.jpg?w=300" alt="" width="300" height="199"></a></p>

<p>Sunrise and sunset are appealing to photographers for another reason. They are typically the hours when wildlife is most active, so your chances of capturing that perfect image of a fox or a bear or any manner of feathered creatures rise exponentially.</p>

<p>If you are traveling abroad, the hours just after sunrise are terrific for photographing local markets. There is typically a lot of hustle and bustle during that period, so with a medium telephoto lens you can stand unobtrusively in a doorway and shoot people setting up their stalls and arranging their exotic wares. (If you intend to use the images for commercial publication, be sure to get model releases from the people you photograph if they are recognizable in the photo… more on that in a later blog).</p>

<p>Sunset is an equally magical time to shoot, although you will most definitely run into more photographers at sunset than at sunrise. Sometimes the fight for photographic territory can be intense at sunset in places like the South Rim of the Grand Canyon.</p>

<p><a href="http://blog.lesterpickerphoto.com/wp-content/uploads/2010/01/blog-sunrise-3-of-4.jpg"><img class="size-medium wp-image-103" title="Arctic Sunrise" src="http://blog.lesterpickerphoto.com/wp-content/uploads/2010/01/blog-sunrise-3-of-4.jpg?w=300" alt="" width="300" height="199"></a></p>

<p>Whatever its challenges, the aesthetic rewards of shooting early and late easily make it worthwhile. And don’t think you need to travel to some exotic locale. Just set your alarm and witness your own backyard in a totally different perspective.</p>

<p>Last year I remember being in Yukon Territory. I set my alarm for 3:00 AM to photograph the spectacular northern lights over the Yukon River. In the morning, one of my local hosts asked what I was doing up so early. I mentioned my drive up the local mountain to get a good view of the aurora. He had lived in the Yukon for five years. He flat out told me that he had only seen the lights once!</p>

<h3>Equipment You Will Need</h3>


<p>In terms of equipment I <em>always</em> use my tripod for sunrise/sunset because I want maximum depth-of-field, which slows the shutter speed. Add a cable release and you are set… well, almost. I also use filters at sunrise and sunset.</p>

<p>When you photograph sunrise/sunset, the sky begins to light up while the land in the foreground is still relatively dark. The lighter sky fools your meter into thinking it needs to close down the aperture to restrict the light hitting the sensor. That will render the foreground black, with no details in the shadows.</p>

<p>The way to compensate for this is to use a graduated neutral density filter. A GND filter is a piece of plastic or glass that you place in front of the lens. It is darker at the top and gradually becomes transparent about halfway down. In essence you are putting sunglasses only on the sky portion of your image. Just slide the filter until only the sky is shaded and- voila! – you have the prefect sunrise image. GND filters come is various strengths and with trial and error, and liberal use of the histogram, you will become proficient in their use. I use GNDs from Singh Ray (<a href="http://www.singhray.com">www.singhray.com</a>) and Lee filters (<a href="http://www.leeusa.com">www.leefiltersusa.com</a>) or you can purchase them through B&amp;H (<a href="http://www.bandh.com">www.bandh.com</a>) or Adorama (<a href="http://www.adorama.com">www.adorama.com</a>). In a future blog I’ll explain how to use these GNDs in more detail.</p>

<p><a href="http://blog.lesterpickerphoto.com/wp-content/uploads/2010/01/blog-sunrise-2-of-4.jpg"><img class="size-medium wp-image-104" title="Maui Sunset" src="http://blog.lesterpickerphoto.com/wp-content/uploads/2010/01/blog-sunrise-2-of-4.jpg?w=300" alt="" width="300" height="199"></a></p>

<p>Singh-Ray makes a specialty filter known as a Daryl Benson Reverse Neutral Density Graduated Filter. I know that’s a mouthful, but here’s what it does that proves very useful. Let’s say you want to shoot a sunrise where the sun is just peeking out over the horizon. That bright orb will blow out your shot and ruin your image. The Reverse ND filter places a band of ‘sunglasses’ right across the horizon zone, holding back some of that light and allowing for a nicely exposed image in most cases.</p>

<p>Try getting up tomorrow before dawn and you’ll be amazed at what awaits in your own town or neighborhood!</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>After more than 30 years in photography, I’ve come to understand that our art consists of two major distinctions. The first is creative vision, the second is technological. I’ll be writing a lot about the creative aspects of photography – the right mental attitude, the vision, the motivations- but in this blog I’ll discuss one technological issue that seems to plague amateur photographers. That is the decision to shoot in aperture priority, shutter priority or fully automatic.</p>

<p>I’ll be the first to admit that today’s DSLRs do a pretty fine job on automatic. Just set it and forget it. The camera’s onboard computer does all the calculations, averages out the exposure values in a scene and- voilà !- you have a nice photo. Coupled with autofocus, you will almost always come back with a decent photo.</p>

<p>But for a professional or advanced amateur, ‘decent’ is just not good enough. In fact, it can be the kiss of death. We look for images that go beyond decent to great, memorable, and most important of all, saleable. Average simply doesn’t cut it.</p>

<p>If we eliminate the totally automatic setting, then, we are left with two choices : aperture priority or shutter priority. The choice between these two may be simpler than you might imagine. Think of it this way. Shutter priority allows you to control the shutter speed. If you are shooting sports or any subject that is moving rapidly <strong>and</strong> you want to freeze the action, select shutter priority. Set your camera to the fastest shutter speed that still allows a recognizable image and the camera takes over the rest. For general sports, you would want a shutter speed of at least 1/250<sup>th</sup> of a second or faster. To stop your daughter’s goalie soccer save, you might want to shoot at 1/500 or even 1/1000 of a second. Ditto for a NASCAR event.</p>

<p>If you shoot landscape and nature scenes, even wildlife, I suggest that you consider shooting in aperture priority. Virtually every landscape professional I know shoots in aperture priority. Let’s see why.</p>

<p>When shooting landscapes, you usually want everything possible to be in focus, from nearby objects to distant mountains. That means you should use smaller apertures, say f11, f16 or even f22. Remember that the larger the number, the smaller the aperture. By aperture we refer to the round opening in the camera lens that allows light in when you press the shutter release button (the interleaved metallic gizmo that opens and shuts to create the aperture is called the diaphragm). As aperture decreases (in other words as it goes from f2.8 to f16, for example, the more individual parts of your scene will be in focus.</p>

<p><a href="http://blog.lesterpickerphoto.com/wp-content/uploads/2010/01/picker-moo-image-42-of-51.jpg"><img class="size-medium wp-image-109" title="Moraine Lake" src="http://blog.lesterpickerphoto.com/wp-content/uploads/2010/01/picker-moo-image-42-of-51.jpg?w=198" alt="" width="198" height="300"></a></p>

<p>If you were to measure how much of the foreground and background is in focus you would be referring to the depth of field of the image. And that’s where knowing how to shoot in aperture priority comes in handy. The rule is this; as the aperture decreases in size, the depth of field increases. Think of squinting. When we squint, we reduce the opening in the diaphragm of our eyes so that the scene appears to be more in focus.</p>

<p>Okay, so how does this knowledge help to create better images? Let’s look at some examples. You want to take a picture of your no doubt good-looking and brilliant child sitting on a park bench. Behind your prodigy is a busy street scene. Cars are whizzing by, trees and flowers clutter the background, and a huge billboard advertising beer (with the requisite buxom cheerleader) is positioned just to the right of your child’s head.</p>

<p><a href="http://blog.lesterpickerphoto.com/wp-content/uploads/2010/01/picker-moo-image-2-of-511.jpg"><img class="size-medium wp-image-113" title="PICKER-Moo image 2 of 51" src="http://blog.lesterpickerphoto.com/wp-content/uploads/2010/01/picker-moo-image-2-of-511.jpg?w=217" alt="" width="217" height="300"></a></p>

<p>If you are shooting in aperture-priority, you would simply “open up the lens” by increasing the aperture setting to f2.8 or 3.5 or 4.0. That would seriously reduce the depth-of-field, meaning that your child’s face would be in focus, but everything in the background would be blurry. In fact, if you can open up the lens to f2.8 it would render the background a soft blur that would force the viewer’s eye to the face rather than the distractions in the background.</p>

<p>On the other hand, suppose you are standing on the South Rim of the Grand Canyon and want a classic shot of the nearby point that sticks out. But you also want to capture the gorge itself and the North Rim. In this case you would set the aperture on f11, f16 or f22. That would increase the depth-of-field and just about everything in your image would be sharp.</p>

<p><a href="http://blog.lesterpickerphoto.com/wp-content/uploads/2010/01/picker-moo-image-22-of-51.jpg"><img class="size-medium wp-image-111" title="Survival" src="http://blog.lesterpickerphoto.com/wp-content/uploads/2010/01/picker-moo-image-22-of-51.jpg?w=199" alt="" width="199" height="300"></a></p>

<p>One final point. You may wonder why the aperture settings are so oddly numbered. The usual complement of f stops in most lenses is: f2.8, f4.0, f5.6, f8.0, f11, f16 and f22. These numbers are actual the product of the formula that calculates the surface area of the camera’s diaphragm opening. Fuggedaboudit. The only important thing to know is that each f-stop successively halves the amount of light entering the lens as you go from f2.8 to f22. Conversely, as you go from f22 to f2.8, the amount of light hitting your camera’s sensor doubles each time you increase one f-stop.</p>

<p>To paraphrase Ansel Adams, photography is nothing more than capturing and manipulating light. If you want to increase the depth-of-field you will be decreasing the amount of light entering the camera. So that means that for you to get a balanced shot you would need to allow the diaphragm to remain open longer. In some cases you may need to leave the shutter open so long you may need to use a tripod to nail that Grand Canyon shot. Usually, most adults can hand-hold a camera up to 1/25<sup>th</sup> of a second without hand-shake that would blur the image. If your camera tells you that at f16 you would need to use a shutter speed of 1/10<sup>th</sup> of a second, do yourself a favor and mount the camera on a tripod (or a Joby, a neat mini-tripod that bends in every conceivable way and is available on the Internet or in camera stores).</p>

<p>So, if you’re currently shooting everything in Automatic, try aperture priority next time you’re out. You’ll gain more creative control over your images and once you get the hang of it I’ll bet you’ll like your images a whole lot more.</p>
