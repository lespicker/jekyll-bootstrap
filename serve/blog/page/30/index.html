  <div class="entry-content"><p>By now you readers know that I only review items that I have actually used, ones that have made my photography job easier… or a living hell! Since I do not allow advertisers on my site, I am beholden to no one and always try to tell it like it is. Of course, I’m always quick to remind you that these reviews only reflect my opinion and you may find the same piece of gear perfect for your needs. Go figure!</p>

<p>With that in mind, here’s my take on Right Angle Viewers (RAV), which I consider an indispensable piece of equipment, especially if you are over 40.</p>

<p>First some background. RAVs screw or clip into the eyepiece of a camera and allow you to view the scene at right angles to the viewer. Every one that I have seen or used allows the RAV to rotate, so you can use it in landscape or portrait mode. Ninety percent of the time you’ll use it by peering down into the RAV from above. But, in rare instances you’ll want to have your camera on a tripod a few inches higher than your head, and a RAV is perfect for that situation, too.</p>

<p>Hoodman (<a href="http://www.hoodmanusa.com">www.hoodmanusa.com</a>) used to make a nice RAV for $130, with adapters for use on just about any DSLR camera. But in September, 2010 they pulled it off the market. They claim they will replace it with an entirely new design sometime in mid-2011, so stay tuned. In the meantime, you can still pick up the Hoodman RAV at photography resellers.</p>

<p>Personally, I use two Nikon RAVs, one for my D300 and one for my D700/D3X. They cost considerably more, but one of them I snagged used at a good price and the other I bought new through eBay and saved $50 off the street price. The thing about RAVs is that they do not enter into the optical path of the image and therefore you really don’t have to be too concerned about their optical quality.</p>

<p><a href="http://blog.lesterpickerphoto.com/wp-content/uploads/2010/09/ASSET_60417.jpg"><img class="size-medium wp-image-572" title="ASSET_60417" src="http://blog.lesterpickerphoto.com/wp-content/uploads/2010/09/ASSET_60417-300x300.jpg" alt="" width="300" height="300"></a></p>

<p><a href="http://blog.lesterpickerphoto.com/wp-content/uploads/2010/09/NKDR5.jpg"><img class="size-medium wp-image-573" title="NKDR5" src="http://blog.lesterpickerphoto.com/wp-content/uploads/2010/09/NKDR5-300x300.jpg" alt="" width="300" height="300"></a></p>

<p>RAVs also have a built-in diopter adjustment so that you can tweak it to your vision. Most also have a switch that flips between 1x magnification and 2x or 2.5x. That’s great for those times when you need critical focus. Just remember when you flip the switch to 2x. More than once I’ve looked at the scene through my RAV and forgot that I was viewing it enlarged two times what the image actually is.</p>

<p>I always carry my two RAVs in the side pouches of my backpack, ready to quickly pull out and use. Here’s a photo that an amateur Swiss photographer, Bruno Stadelmann, took of me using the RAV at Lake Louise, Alberta, Canada. It’s painful enough that I had to contort my body into that position, but imagine if I had to lie on my stomach to get that shot. There’s just no way I could do that nowadays, at least not for a prolonged period of time.</p>

<p><a href="http://blog.lesterpickerphoto.com/wp-content/uploads/2010/09/A74D0850.jpg"><img class="aligncenter size-medium wp-image-586" title="A74D0850" src="http://blog.lesterpickerphoto.com/wp-content/uploads/2010/09/A74D0850-300x199.jpg" alt="" width="300" height="199"></a></p>

<p>As you can imagine, a RAV is ideal for shooting flowers, insects or any low-to-the-ground subject. I also find it absolutely critical for water or stream work, when you cant bend over enough without getting your clothes or equipment soaked. I sometimes use waders to get into a stream with camera and tripod for a well-composed image and my RAV allows me to do that without having to lie down in the stream.</p>

<p>If you are part of the over-the-hill crowd, or just take a lot of macro shots, do yourself a favor and indulge. Your back will sing your praises (not to say your neck, knees and elbows)!</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>How crazy that we spend $5,000 and up on a camera setup (hey, the D3X body alone is $7,500!!) and we can get tripped up by not spending another $8.69?  That is exactly what I spend on a pair of kneepads at Home Depot. Since I use them pretty heavily when I’m out shooting landscapes, I go through them or lose them pretty regularly, so I like to keep the cost under $10 a pair.</p>

<p>I have found that kneepads can make the difference between a mediocre shot and a great one. If you are kneeling on a pebbly beach, there is no way you can stay in one position for long. Patience is a photographic virtue, but tolerating pain shouldn’t be. I also found that once I reached 40, my knees just couldn’t take the stress of being on stones, cement, or even sand for very long. And, if you’re a landscape or wildlife photographer, those are the very elements you face every time you are out on a shoot. Kneepads even help when kneeling on wet grass.</p>

<p>I tend to use the simplest kneepads, only because I find they work best. Here’s what mine look like:</p>

<p><a href="http://blog.lesterpickerphoto.com/wp-content/uploads/2010/09/knee-pads-1-of-31.jpg"><img class="size-medium wp-image-566" title="knee pads 1 of 3" src="http://blog.lesterpickerphoto.com/wp-content/uploads/2010/09/knee-pads-1-of-31-300x199.jpg" alt="" width="300" height="199"></a></p>

<p><a href="http://blog.lesterpickerphoto.com/wp-content/uploads/2010/09/knee-pads-2-of-31.jpg"><img class="aligncenter size-medium wp-image-567" title="knee pads 2 of 3" src="http://blog.lesterpickerphoto.com/wp-content/uploads/2010/09/knee-pads-2-of-31-199x300.jpg" alt="" width="199" height="300"></a></p>

<p><a href="http://blog.lesterpickerphoto.com/wp-content/uploads/2010/09/knee-pads-3-of-31.jpg"><img class="size-medium wp-image-568" title="knee pads 3 of 3" src="http://blog.lesterpickerphoto.com/wp-content/uploads/2010/09/knee-pads-3-of-31-199x300.jpg" alt="" width="199" height="300"></a></p>

<p>The good thing about these pads is that they are very lightweight and flexible. I typically put them on at the beginning of my hike and leave them on all day. If I do take them off, I wrap the Velcro straps around the handle of my backpack and off I go.</p>

<p>I recommend that you do <strong>not</strong> buy the kneepads with the plastic reinforced outer surface. I find that they slip on wet rocks. They are hard to wear for prolonged hikes. They are significantly more expensive. They also make unnecessary tapping and scraping sounds, a definite distraction in wildlife photography and a barrier to making friends with fellow photographers.</p>

<p>I’ve also found that kneepads with the solid elastic back, the ones you have to put your foot through in order to get them on, are worse than useless for photographers. As you hike, they cause long pants to ride up, especially if you wear a high tech fabric. They also gather in the back of the knee and cut off circulation. If you wear them with shorts, the back of your knee will sweat and become chafed. That’s why I prefer the ones with two Velcro straps.</p>

<p>FYI, the type I use is McGuire-Nicholas Soft Cushion Kneepads (Model # 345), but any inexpensive pair you find should work well enough. An accessory like this is hardly ever mentioned in the photography magazines, but is a real boon to pros or advanced amateurs who are out in the field.</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>I thought I’d do a wrap-up of my Canadian Rockies trip. There’s no way to soften this; photographically, it sucked! Oh, I snagged <strong><em>some</em></strong> decent images, but not one-tenth of what I had hoped. But, as far as family-bonding time went, that was wonderful, so I’m really not complaining. Okay, maybe a little bit.</p>

<p>The photography challenge was a combination of rainy weather and forest fires. More than 300 fires were burning in British Columbia during my visit, casting nearly every scene in a brownish haze that not even my Singh-Ray polarizer could cut through. To see some great examples of the hazy conditions, please visit the website of one of my blogging regulars, Cindy Kilpatrick. The British Columbia native and photographer has scads of images of the smoke and haze that enveloped her gorgeous province this summer (<a href="http://missusk76.wordpress.com/2010/08/29/wanted-smell-o-photo/">http://missusk76.wordpress.com/2010/08/29/wanted-smell-o-photo/</a>).</p>

<p>Four of my 14 days were spent on trains. Train travel is great; you get a chance to see the countryside without worrying about the joker tailgating you at 100kph an hour (that’s Canadian for around 60mph, but 100kph sounds more… adventuresome). Dinner is served in a dining car or at your seat, relieving anxiety over which greasy spoon joint the family gets the pleasure of sampling (it’s not the venue that I’m anxious about so much as spending the following 4 hours cramped in an enclosed car suffering the aftereffects of said food venue).</p>

<p>Photography on and from a train, however, is limited. To document my trip as a photojournalist, I took umpteen images of people on the train enjoying themselves; eating, talking, reading, eating, taking photographs from the train, eating. Which brings me to the next point.</p>

<p><a href="http://blog.lesterpickerphoto.com/wp-content/uploads/2010/09/rockiesblog-1-of-1.jpg"><img class="size-medium wp-image-541" title="rockiesblog 1 of 1" src="http://blog.lesterpickerphoto.com/wp-content/uploads/2010/09/rockiesblog-1-of-1-199x300.jpg" alt="" width="199" height="300"></a></p>

<p>Taking photographs <strong><em>from</em></strong> a train ain’t easy. If you’re shooting a DSLR you have an advantage, since you can control more variables such as shutter speed and ISO. With a point-and-shoot your options can be limited. Trains move forward. They roll from side to side. They vibrate. As the train goes through its motions, you are moving, too. Now combine two (or three or four) of those movements and you have what I would call a challenging photography environment (see my blog on “Train Photography” in the <em>Notes from the Field</em> section).</p>

<p><a href="http://blog.lesterpickerphoto.com/wp-content/uploads/2010/09/rockiesblog-1-of-10.jpg"><img class="size-medium wp-image-553 " title="rockiesblog 1 of 10" src="http://blog.lesterpickerphoto.com/wp-content/uploads/2010/09/rockiesblog-1-of-10-300x199.jpg" alt="" width="300" height="199"></a></p>

<p>Now add to my frustration the fact that there was an almost constant haze as we rolled through much of British Columbia (I told you to go to Cindy Kilpatrick’s site, didn’t I?) and you could have heard my blood pressure rising. On the plus side I simply put my cameras away for much of the trip and just enjoyed the scenery and the company of my wife and our 16-year old granddaughter (when she wasn’t in a teen funk, that is).</p>

<p>Another two full days – prime shooting time in Jasper National Park- was spent seeking shelter from the deluge. On our rainy 4-hour drive from Jasper to Moraine Lake we did not see a single bear, moose, elk, deer, or coyote. Speak to anyone who has driven the Icefields Parkway during berry season and they will tell you just how unusual that is. It was certainly a first for me.</p>

<p>I’m already planning a winter trip back to the Canadian Rockies, but that will have to wait until 2011 (more likely 2012), since I’m scheduled to be back in the Yukon this winter.</p>

<p>Now for the highlights of my just completed trip and my recommendations:</p>

<p>The <strong><em>Rocky Mountaineer</em></strong> was a delight from our start in Vancouver to our finish in Jasper. If you go, try to indulge and purchase Gold Leaf service, rather than the Red Leaf. It’ll be well worth it for the extra services and upgraded food.</p>

<p><a href="http://blog.lesterpickerphoto.com/wp-content/uploads/2010/09/rockiesblog-trainfood-1-of-1.jpg"><img class="size-medium wp-image-542" title="rockiesblog-trainfood 1 of 1" src="http://blog.lesterpickerphoto.com/wp-content/uploads/2010/09/rockiesblog-trainfood-1-of-1-199x300.jpg" alt="" width="199" height="300"></a></p>

<p><strong><em>Jasper and Banff National Parks</em></strong>. Look, I’m not saying that we don’t have drop-dead gorgeous parks here in the U.S. But we have to share ours with 300 million other people. Canada, by contrast, has 30 million people and about the same land mass. Do the math. That’s why photographing in Jasper and Banff is usually a pleasure (except for July and August). <em>Best advice</em>: If you’re going to the Canadian Rockies to photograph, you’ve got to pick up Darwin Wiggett’s book, “How to Photograph the Canadian Rockies.”  It’ll be the best travel-related investment you ever made. <em>Hint</em>: <strong>always</strong> carry bear spray with you.</p>

<p><a href="http://blog.lesterpickerphoto.com/wp-content/uploads/2010/09/rockiesblog-5-of-10.jpg"><img class="size-medium wp-image-543" title="Moraine Lake, Alberta" src="http://blog.lesterpickerphoto.com/wp-content/uploads/2010/09/rockiesblog-5-of-10-300x199.jpg" alt="" width="300" height="199"></a></p>

<p>If you plan to visit Moraine Lake, try booking into the <strong><em>Moraine Lake Lodge</em></strong>. I prefer Moraine Lake to its more famous sister, Lake Louise, because the crowds are smaller and the atmosphere at the lake is so spiritual. Be sure to hike the easy trail that goes along the lakeshore to the glacial stream that feeds it.</p>

<p><a href="http://blog.lesterpickerphoto.com/wp-content/uploads/2010/09/rockiesblog-4-of-10.jpg"><img class="size-medium wp-image-544" title="rockiesblog 4 of 10" src="http://blog.lesterpickerphoto.com/wp-content/uploads/2010/09/rockiesblog-4-of-10-199x300.jpg" alt="" width="199" height="300"></a></p>

<p>If your plans include visiting Yoho National Park between Lake Louise and Banff, try to book a room at the reasonably priced <strong><em>Cathedral Mountain Lodge</em></strong>. It’s in an odd location- right next to an interesting and historic series of railroad tunnels- but it has great ambience, food and service to match. The cabins are very well designed and spacious. It&#8217;s biggest draw is that it sits in the midst of Yoho National Park, a mecca for hikers, bikers and kayakers.</p>

<p><a href="http://blog.lesterpickerphoto.com/wp-content/uploads/2010/09/rockiesblog-Takkakaw-1-of-1.jpg"><img class="size-medium wp-image-545" title="rockiesblog-Takkakaw 1 of 1" src="http://blog.lesterpickerphoto.com/wp-content/uploads/2010/09/rockiesblog-Takkakaw-1-of-1-199x300.jpg" alt="" width="199" height="300"></a></p>

<p><strong><em>ViaRail</em></strong> is a less expensive alternative to the Rocky Mountaineer and is the only way to get from Jasper to Port Hardy. There is no dining car and the lone observation car is an older vintage than the newer Rocky Mountaineer with its wrap-around windows. However, the service was excellent, thanks to our attendants, Ron and Bruce.  The scenery is also spectacular when the haze dissipated.</p>

<p><a href="http://blog.lesterpickerphoto.com/wp-content/uploads/2010/09/rockiesblog-7-of-10.jpg"><img class="size-medium wp-image-554" title="rockiesblog 7 of 10" src="http://blog.lesterpickerphoto.com/wp-content/uploads/2010/09/rockiesblog-7-of-10-300x199.jpg" alt="" width="300" height="199"></a></p>

<p>The Prince Rupert to Port Hardy Ferry run by <strong><em>BC Ferries</em></strong> is an incredible experience. The 15-hour journey takes you along the inner passage, so close to the shoreline you could make out bears, elk and moose. The scenery is spectacular as you pass island preserves such as Princess Royal Island, home of the Kermode white spirit bears, all in the safety and comfort of a large ferry.</p>

<p><a href="http://blog.lesterpickerphoto.com/wp-content/uploads/2010/09/rockiesblog-ferry-1-of-1.jpg"><img class="size-medium wp-image-546" title="BC Ferries, Prince Rupert to Port Hardy" src="http://blog.lesterpickerphoto.com/wp-content/uploads/2010/09/rockiesblog-ferry-1-of-1-199x300.jpg" alt="" width="199" height="300"></a></p>

<p><strong><em>Gibsons</em></strong>, an artsy town on the Sunshine coast of British Columbia is a jewel, its busy harbor surrounded as it is by towering mountains. It’s terrific for hiking, biking, kayaking and just plain ambling through town. Great restaurants, too. I love this place.</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>To “ogle” means to look at someone flirtatiously or lasciviously, according to Webster’s. So, I invented the term “oogle” (a takeoff on Google, no doubt) to describe a behavior that many of us landscape photographers do.</p>

<p>Perhaps you’ve seen this in action. A pro photographer takes an image and as soon as it pops up on the LCD, he (or she) whips out a little black device from a belt holster or from around his neck, hunches over perilously close to his LCD screen and just… well… oogles.</p>

<p><a href="http://blog.lesterpickerphoto.com/wp-content/uploads/2010/08/H-LPP30.gif"><img class="size-medium wp-image-533" title="H-LPP30" src="http://blog.lesterpickerphoto.com/wp-content/uploads/2010/08/H-LPP30-300x231.gif" alt="" width="300" height="231"></a></p>

<p>The device in question is Hoodman’s HoodLoupe 3.0, an $80 contraption that I’d absolutely never be without. It’s basically a glorified magnifying lens. It fits perfectly over an LCD screen. For a man like me who has to take off his glasses every time he snaps the shutter and then put them back on to see the camera screen, the HoodLoupe is a lifesaver. Plus, I can see the screen with no glare whatsoever, even in the brightest light. And a +/- 3  diopter focus adjustment allows me to adjust the HoodLoupe perfectly for my eyes.</p>

<p>Some pros make heavy use of Nikon’s Live View feature to adjust critical focus (Cannon has a similar feature), but I often have difficulty using it in very bright light. Instead, I find the HoodLoupe to be helpful. On image review I enlarge the image and can see it with critical detail through the HoodLoupe.</p>

<p>The HoodLoupe comes with a belt carrying pouch and neck strap. I use the belt pouch, since I already have my glasses and a camera strap dangling from my neck.</p>

<p>Hoodman has a short video showing the HoodLoupe in action. Go to:  <a href="http://www.hoodmanusa.com">www.hoodmanusa.com</a>.</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>I recently traveled to Costa Rica, that anomaly of a country where 25% of the land is held in national parks and where eco-consciousness is a way of life, not political posturing.</p>

<p>Two hotels in the capital city of San Jose that I stayed in serve as metaphors for the old versus new way of thinking. The Gran Hotel de Costa Rica is a magnificent structure, built in the heyday of the capital city. It is huge, ornate and, sadly, run down. The marble and wood entryway are impressive, as is the classic restaurant sitting area as one enters.</p>

<p><a href="http://blog.lesterpickerphoto.com/wp-content/uploads/2010/08/images-1.jpeg"><img class="size-full wp-image-521" title="images-1" src="http://blog.lesterpickerphoto.com/wp-content/uploads/2010/08/images-1.jpeg" alt="" width="276" height="182"></a></p>

<p>But, initial impressions are deceiving. Look behind the lobby and you have tiny, claustrophobic rooms with no air conditioning and poor ventilation. The rooms have that tired, worn look and the bathrooms are tiny. It reminded me of the old, long-gone days of the South American renaissance.</p>

<p>Oddly enough, the ground floor restaurant food and service was mediocre, while the lunch buffet on an upstairs floor was excellent and a draw for businesspeople and tourists alike. Go figure!</p>

<p>One thing about San Jose that tourists eager to travel to Costa Rica should know is that it is not a particularly safe city. Wander even a block or two from the main downtown area and you are asking for trouble. Since most tourists are in CR to see the parks and wildlife, that’s usually no problem. Just stay in or right around your hotel. San Jose hotels serve as springboards to eco-tours. You fly in, spend a night getting a good sleep and off you go to see howler monkeys in the wild.</p>

<p>So, after three nights in the Gran, I decided to try something completely different. I booked into the Parque del Lago Hotel Vivo, where I had visited earlier for a business presentation and was impressed by the catering and attentive staff.</p>

<p><a href="http://blog.lesterpickerphoto.com/wp-content/uploads/2010/08/foto-fachada-vaca-creencias.jpg"><img class="size-medium wp-image-528" title="foto fachada vaca, creencias" src="http://blog.lesterpickerphoto.com/wp-content/uploads/2010/08/foto-fachada-vaca-creencias-225x300.jpg" alt="" width="225" height="300"></a></p>

<p>The Parque is a boutique hotel, a smartly executed concept by Ana Alfaro, whose vision of an intimate guest experience for the world traveler is reflected in every aspect of the hotel’s operation. Walk in the door and you know you are entering the future of hospitality in CR. There is nothing pretentious here. The hotel has a fresh look and is immaculately clean. The rooms are, well… roomy. Mine had a windowed, airy, separate seating area that allowed me to do my work in comfort on the couch or at the small desk. The bathroom was freshly scrubbed. And the prices are quite reasonable.</p>

<p><a href="http://blog.lesterpickerphoto.com/wp-content/uploads/2010/08/P5090364.jpg"><img class="size-medium wp-image-525 " title="P5090364" src="http://blog.lesterpickerphoto.com/wp-content/uploads/2010/08/P5090364-225x300.jpg" alt="" width="225" height="300"></a></p>

<p>Each floor carries a separate motif reflecting forest, water and fire, the elemental forces that shaped and are Costa Rica today. The ground floor has engaging informational panels painted onto the walls, explaining the culture and history of CR. A small gift shop reflects the canteenas of old. But, it is in the small and tastefully designed restaurant that the Parque truly shines.</p>

<p>Alfaro brought in Executive chef Pedro Reyes to develop a CR-based cuisine where every bite is a morsel of Valhalla. I feasted on mahi mahi prepared with sliver-fried plantains and a light cream sauce. The palate feel of melt-in-your-mouth fresh fish and crisp plantains was perfectly balanced and the sauce burst open with notes of citrus. The traditional Costa Rican rice and beans was raised to a higher level with the addition of a hint of spicy heat. I ended the meal with a desert aptly named “Plantain in Glory,” a scoop of vanilla ice cream surrounded by sliced, warm plantain cooked in caramel sauce, white wine, cinnamon, and sugar. Even a simple item like coffee was excellent, a strong brew of home-grown beans.</p>

<p>The dining room itself is small, intimate and unpretentious, with nicely designed elements of Costa Rican culture gracing the walls. The soft Latin music was a perfect complement to the dining experience.</p>

<p>One final note; the staff at Parque was exceptional, which I believe reflects Alfaro’s passion. They were helpful without being pushy. They were cheerful and enthusiastic. I found myself wondering when the last time was that I could say that about a hotel staff.</p>

<p>If you’re planning a trip to Costa Rica that includes San Jose, do yourself a favor and treat yourself to the Parque del Lago Hotel Vivo experience. You won’t regret it.</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>Every so often someone sneaks a photo of me. As with many photographers, I’m terribly non-photogenic, so I kinda like it when someone candidly catches me at work in the field. Here I am at exquisite Lake Louise in Alberta, Canada, in a position I often find myself, contorted over a must-have image. In this case the pickings were slim, as it was a cold, rainy, overcast day. I wasn’t even going to bother with a picture. I don’t particularly like Lake Louise for the huge crowds it draws in summer. Just then the sun tried to break through (it never really did), and I quickly got to work.</p>

<p><a href="http://blog.lesterpickerphoto.com/wp-content/uploads/2010/08/A74D0850.jpg"><img class="size-medium wp-image-513" title="A74D0850" src="http://blog.lesterpickerphoto.com/wp-content/uploads/2010/08/A74D0850-300x199.jpg" alt="" width="300" height="199"></a></p>

<p>Lucky for me, Bruno and Angie Stadelmann from Riehen, Switzerland were passing by. Bruno is an avid amateur photographer and, unbeknownst to me, grabbed this shot. Thanks, Bruno!</p>

<p>(BTW, here is one of the images that I was taking when Bruno wandered by. It will be one of several images that I may combine into a panorama. With the lousy weather, however, there are absolutely no reflections in the water, so I may just can the whole thing. Stay tuned).</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>We’re sitting on the aft deck of the Northern Expedition, a BC Ferry en route from Prince Rupert to Port Hardy, British Columbia, Canada, when I notice my granddaughter, bless her 16-year old heart, staring at my hands, which were at that moment, clutching my camera and a telephoto lens.</p>

<p>“Pop-pop,” she says, perfectly seriously. “I think you should be a hand model for AARP.” Then she bursts out laughing.</p>

<p>So, my question for you, dear reader’s, is this: Is she right? (Please be kind!)</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>Right now it’s the mid-afternoon lull, the time when any decent photographer is bone tired, having arisen before dawn to snag those incredible sunrise images. I’m onboard the Northern Expedition, a British Columbia ferry traveling between Prince Rupert and Port Hardy, a 15-hour journey through the spectacular Queen Charlotte Islands of the Canadian Pacific coast. God, they’re beautiful! Dense evergreen forest covers the mountains from summit to sea as we weave through narrow channels along our 500km route.</p>

<p>Actually, I didn’t get any sunrise pics, but I’ve got an excuse a notch better than “the dog ate my homework.” I had to get up at 4:45 in order to be at the ferry terminal in sleepy Prince Rupert by 5:30. No one I asked was able to explain to me why all passengers had to be there by 5:30 when the ferry didn’t leave until 7:30, but rules are rules and here’s where the Canadians betray their British roots (hey, Queen Elizabeth is still officially the Queen of Canada).</p>

<p>So far we’ve traveled from Maryland, USA by plane to Vancouver, then via train on a 2-day wonderful rail trip on the Rocky Mountaineer to Jasper, Alberta (see my previous blog on that train trip) where we rented a car and spent 4 days photographing the incredible landscape (actually it was 1-1/2 days, as it rained hard the rest of the time). Then it was on to Prince Rupert, again by train, but this time with Canada’s ViaRail system. Now it’s ferry time.</p>

<p>I can’t photograph now because the afternoon sun has flattened the landscape into a shapeless pastiche. That, and the fact that major forest fires in British Columbia have laid a blanket of haze over the land. So, a perfect time to blog, this time on the topic of photographing onboard ship, not so much instructional as observational.</p>

<p><a href="http://blog.lesterpickerphoto.com/wp-content/uploads/2010/08/BC-Ferries-12009-08-18.jpg"><img class="size-medium wp-image-500" title="BC Ferries 12009-08-18" src="http://blog.lesterpickerphoto.com/wp-content/uploads/2010/08/BC-Ferries-12009-08-18-200x300.jpg" alt="" width="200" height="300"></a></p>

<p>Ferries are noisy ships, since they depend on significant horsepower to power hundreds of cars, passengers, crew and supplies. You can feel the vibration of the engines clear into your bones no matter where on deck you stand. But, the human body is an amazing organism and our very bulk and loose connections between bones absorb some of that vibration. And so my first lesson, if you will. Don’t lean against a wall or, worse yet, put your elbows on the railings to stabilize your shots. You’ll simply serve as a vibration transmission machine (VTM, in scientific parlance) and wonder why your shots are fuzzy or blurry.</p>

<p>That very naturally leads to the second lesson, which is that a tripod is less than totally useless on a ferry (or most other boats). I watched a young man mount a video camera atop a rather flimsy tripod. Even at a distance I could see the danged thing vibrating. The tripod, being a fairly rigid piece of metal, a very useful characteristic on solid land, is simply a VTM on steroids. And with no muscle, fat, tendons or ligaments, it transmits VTM faster than a sick kid does his cold virus to his daycare buddies.</p>

<p>The solution? Hand-hold your camera, elbows at sides. Shoot at 1/250 or faster. Open the aperture to f8 or wider (f5.6, 4, 3.5, 2.8), which usually is not a problem since most water landscapes are at a distance and depth of field may not matter quite so much. If that doesn’t help, dig deep into your camera menus and raise your ISO (assuming your point-and-shoot allows that). If you have a simpler point-and-shoot that doesn’t allow ISO adjustment, and it has a sports mode, try it. Sports mode is designed to allow you to shoot at a faster shutter speed to capture action.</p>

<p>One final observation. Straps. Use them wisely. Here’s what I mean. Probably 95% of the people I saw using their cameras, DSLRs as well as point-and-shoots, didn’t have the strap around their hand or neck. Come on folks! A strap is the cheapest form of insurance you’ll ever have!</p>

<p><a href="http://blog.lesterpickerphoto.com/wp-content/uploads/2010/08/BC-Ferries-22009-08-18.jpg"><img class="size-medium wp-image-501" title="BC Ferries 22009-08-18" src="http://blog.lesterpickerphoto.com/wp-content/uploads/2010/08/BC-Ferries-22009-08-18-199x300.jpg" alt="" width="199" height="300"></a></p>

<p>On the other hand, a strap can be a major liability. Here’s how. I walked through the ferry’s cafeteria and saw half-a-dozen folks put their cameras on the table, the strap dangling down. It seems to me that’s inviting disaster. I was once on the Big Island of Hawaii and saw a man place his high-end Cannon DSLR with a 500mm lens on the tailgate of his SUV. That, by the way, represented a $15,000 investment, minimum. The strap was hanging down. He reached into the SUV to retrieve his camera bag and as he pulled away, the bag caught his camera strap and pulled it to the ground.</p>

<p>To this day I can’t understand why that guy didn’t get down on his knees, crying, his arms outstretched to the lens, which was scattered into at least 350 pieces on the gravel. But it etched into my mind what my father thankfully drummed into my head when he gave me my first camera. NEVER let your camera strap hang carelessly, even for a second.</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>First, to be clear, I’m talking here about taking photos on and from a train, not of a train. There are lots of train enthusiasts out there and I’m often blown away by the quality of the better amateur and pro train photographers. I love grainy black and whites of trains, old train stations, even the expressions of people waiting in stations for their trains. But I’m not a train photographer.</p>

<p><a href="http://blog.lesterpickerphoto.com/wp-content/uploads/2010/08/CanadianRockiesLoop2010-ViaRail-Jasper-PrinceRupert-22010-08-11.jpg"><img class="size-medium wp-image-483" title="CanadianRockiesLoop2010-ViaRail-Jasper-PrinceRupert 22010-08-11" src="http://blog.lesterpickerphoto.com/wp-content/uploads/2010/08/CanadianRockiesLoop2010-ViaRail-Jasper-PrinceRupert-22010-08-11-199x300.jpg" alt="" width="199" height="300"></a></p>

<p>So on this Grand Loop trip I’m taking, I face the challenge of getting decent photos on and from a moving train, which for me is a real pain. First are scenes onboard the train. Okay, that’s not too bad. The inside of the train tends to be in shadow, while the outside is usually bright. That creates severe contrast problems and balancing exposure is tricky.</p>

<p>As a landscape and nature photographer, I always try to use a low ISO, almost always no higher than 200. I want as much fine detail as my sensor can give me. But a train is constantly rocking and rolling and the wheels transmit vibrations to the cars. I find myself having to shoot at ISO 400 and even 800 on occasion in order to get a fast enough shutter speed to capture the onboard action, like images of the chef preparing meals or people enjoying themselves.</p>

<p>I also use a tripod for probably 75% of my outdoor work, but on a train, of course, that’s impossible and would add no real advantage due to the train movements.</p>

<p><a href="http://blog.lesterpickerphoto.com/wp-content/uploads/2010/08/CanadianRockiesLoop2010-ViaRail-Jasper-PrinceRupert-32010-08-11.jpg"><img class="size-medium wp-image-485" title="CanadianRockiesLoop2010-ViaRail-Jasper-PrinceRupert 32010-08-11" src="http://blog.lesterpickerphoto.com/wp-content/uploads/2010/08/CanadianRockiesLoop2010-ViaRail-Jasper-PrinceRupert-32010-08-11-300x199.jpg" alt="" width="300" height="199"></a></p>

<p>Shooting outdoor scenes on a train is equally challenging. Aside from train movements and your own body shakes, now you’ve got constantly changing light to deal with, changes that are far different than I face as a landscape artist. Usually shifting patterns of light are gradual (note I said usually). On a train, the light changes come at you at 50 or 60 miles per hour.</p>

<p>A train spends a huge chunk of its time traveling in tunnels; not the ones that go through mountains, but the ones that are the natural outgrowth of a train traveling on set tracks. Trees grow up alongside the tracks, forming corridors that seem always to be impinging on shots. You see a scene, you rush to frame it, fiddle with the aperture and speed and just when you press the shutter a row of tall trees barrels into view.</p>

<p>In any event, the name of the game for train shooting is speed. With today’s sensors on DSLRs, you can shoot at ISO 400 or 800 with few problems. On a point-and-shoot the problems of shooting aboard a train may be thornier. If you have a high-end point-and-shoot, try upping the ISO and see if you can shoot in Aperture-priority mode. If you have the ability to change the aperture, then switch to a wider aperture. You may lose some depth of field, but rescue the shot.</p>

<p><a href="http://blog.lesterpickerphoto.com/wp-content/uploads/2010/08/CanadianRockiesLoop2010-ViaRail-Jasper-PrinceRupert-62010-08-15.jpg"><img class="size-medium wp-image-487" title="CanadianRockiesLoop2010-ViaRail-Jasper-PrinceRupert 62010-08-15" src="http://blog.lesterpickerphoto.com/wp-content/uploads/2010/08/CanadianRockiesLoop2010-ViaRail-Jasper-PrinceRupert-62010-08-15-199x300.jpg" alt="" width="199" height="300"></a></p>

<p>Another challenge is fellow passengers, who will often vie for choice positions at the railings. My best advice: be nice. Get to your spot early, take your pics, and then offer your spot to another shooter.</p>

<p>Anyway, shooting on a train gives you one commodity that’s usually in short supply… time. You’re stuck on a track, usually with no Internet and sometimes no phone service. My Canadian train adventures lasted 8-10 hours a day for 4 days total. So, I used the time to play around with my camera. Excuse me, I mean I experimented. I tried using the speed and shaking to my advantage. I first started with a slow shutter speed (1/4 to ½ second) as the train whizzed past trees.</p>

<p><a href="http://blog.lesterpickerphoto.com/wp-content/uploads/2010/08/CanadianRockiesLoop2010-ViaRail-Jasper-PrinceRupert-72010-08-15.jpg"><img class="aligncenter size-medium wp-image-488" title="CanadianRockiesLoop2010-ViaRail-Jasper-PrinceRupert 72010-08-15" src="http://blog.lesterpickerphoto.com/wp-content/uploads/2010/08/CanadianRockiesLoop2010-ViaRail-Jasper-PrinceRupert-72010-08-15-300x199.jpg" alt="" width="300" height="199"></a></p>

<p>Then I added a polarizer, lowered the ISO as low as my camera permitted, and shot for up to 2 seconds.</p>

<p><a href="http://blog.lesterpickerphoto.com/wp-content/uploads/2010/08/CanadianRockiesLoop2010-ViaRail-Jasper-PrinceRupert-82010-08-15.jpg"><img class="size-medium wp-image-489" title="CanadianRockiesLoop2010-ViaRail-Jasper-PrinceRupert 82010-08-15" src="http://blog.lesterpickerphoto.com/wp-content/uploads/2010/08/CanadianRockiesLoop2010-ViaRail-Jasper-PrinceRupert-82010-08-15-300x199.jpg" alt="" width="300" height="199"></a></p>

<p>Finally, I used a variable neutral density filter made by Singh Ray to stretch my exposures out to 5 seconds.</p>

<p>I like the next one. As I was taking the image, an old cabin moved into view. Click on the image to see it sized larger.</p>

<p>Happy training!</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>We’re on a two-day train trip from Vancouver, British Columbia to Jasper, Alberta, what many of my fellow passengers are calling the trip of a lifetime. This trip I’m joined by my wife and granddaughter and we are aboard the Rocky Mountaineer, an upscale riding experience that winds through some of the most spectacular scenery in the world, a never-ending smorgasbord of mountain, stream and meadow eye-candy.</p>

<p>For me, one of the joys of travel is chatting with my travel mates and, in the case of the Rocky Mountaineer, I find myself talking with folks from England, Germany, Israel, Canada and all over the U.S.</p>

<p>The Rocky Mountaineer offers two levels of service; Red Leaf and Gold Leaf. Both sport a comfortable ride, nice seating and plenty of room. But the Gold Leaf service seriously amps the juice. Meals are created by a 4-person team for each car individually. In our case Christos Chaldeos, a 25-year old culinary school graduate, managed our kitchen… and did it with aplomb. Individually prepared, hot meals rule, with suitable attention to garnishes and presentation. The wait staff is incredibly attentive.</p>

<p>Life aboard a train quickly falls into a routine. The clacking rhythm of the wheels on the rails, the gentle swaying and the excellent meals together threaten to lull me to sleep. I have to strain to get up to photograph the train experience and the scenery or to type my notes. I’m not sure about the rest of you, but I find shooting from a train to be an exercise in frustration. The train is moving and rocking and vibrating, making proper exposure a dicey situation. Then I get frustrated by the trees, poles and other stuff in the way of my shots. Each car has an outside platform from where you can shoot, but it’s always got 6-10 people out there jockeying for position and conspiring to ruin my shot.</p>

<p>The first day we traveled from Vancouver to Kamloops, a ten-hour ride through the industrial outskirts of Vancouver, through farmland and slight mountains, past copper mines, bald eagles and ospreys. It was a long day, but thoroughly enjoyable.</p>

<p><a href="http://blog.lesterpickerphoto.com/wp-content/uploads/2010/08/CanadianRockiesLoop2010-Rocky-Mountaineer-2010-08-10-1.jpg"><img class="aligncenter size-medium wp-image-477" title="CanadianRockiesLoop2010-Rocky Mountaineer 2010-08-10 (1)" src="http://blog.lesterpickerphoto.com/wp-content/uploads/2010/08/CanadianRockiesLoop2010-Rocky-Mountaineer-2010-08-10-1-300x199.jpg" alt="typical Rocky Mountaineer view" width="300" height="199"></a>The second day we traveled from Kamloops to Jasper. Now here was scenery! Not an hour out of Kamloops we started climbing from 1,200 feet to 3,000 feet by 3:00 PM, and 3,500 feet by time we arrive. The mountains loom 10,000 feet above us, showing off their icy glaciers and mint-green alpine meadows. What an incredible show!</p>

<p>I was in Jasper and Banff National Parks last fall and the train ride has only wetted my appetite to be back and capture some of the amazing landscapes and wildlife. Tonight we’ll be in the town of Jasper and tomorrow we’ll be driving along the spectacular Icefields Parkway oohing and aahing all the way to Banff.</p>

<p>FOOTNOTE: It rained heavily the entire drive from Jasper to Banff. Not one wildlife sighting and the mountains that surrounded us were hidden from view due to the fog and rain. But, we finally made it to Moraine Lodge and I’ll report on that in tomorrow’s blog (assuming I can find a decent Internet connection!).</p>
