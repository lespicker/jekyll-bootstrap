  <div class="entry-content"><h3>My Newest E-Book Is Here!</h3>


<p>I’m really excited to announce that the newest eBook in <strong><em>The Photographer’s Eye</em></strong> series is now available. Titled <strong><em>Wildlife</em></strong>, the eBook takes you behind the scenes as I explain the how, why and technical challenges I faced for ten selected images I have taken of wildlife over the years.</p>

<p>Following on the heels of my first two eBooks, <strong><em>Landscapes 1 </em></strong>&amp;<strong><em> People</em></strong>, the newest addition describes in detail the process I went through to take images of wildlife that my editors and clients have loved. You’ll learn the dos and don’ts of great wildlife photography by following what I did right- and what went wrong- as I captured these images.</p>

<p><a href="http://blog.lesterpickerphoto.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/02/LAP0582.jpg"><img class="alignnone size-medium wp-image-1997" title="_LAP0582" src="http://blog.lesterpickerphoto.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/02/LAP0582-300x200.jpg" alt="" width="300" height="200"></a></p>

<p>In <strong><em>Wildlife</em></strong> I’ve also intentionally broadened the definition of wildlife to include small, as well as large animals, and urban critters as well as those found in remote locales.</p>

<p>Each two-page spread includes an ultra high-quality 300dpi image and a page of background and explanation. Included with each image are the precise camera settings I used. Unlike other eBooks, all my eBook images are color managed for the absolutely highest quality possible.</p>

<p><a href="http://blog.lesterpickerphoto.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/02/2006-11-ecuador1566.jpg"><img class="alignnone size-medium wp-image-1998" title="Amazon tree boa" src="http://blog.lesterpickerphoto.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/02/2006-11-ecuador1566-300x200.jpg" alt="" width="300" height="200"></a></p>

<p>As in all issues of my <strong><em>The Photographer’s Eye</em></strong> eBooks, <strong><em>Wildlife</em></strong> concludes with a section of detailed tips and suggestions. Titled “Photographing Wildlife: Ten Tips for Images With Impact,” you will get point-by-point recommendations for animal photographs that will add drama and punch to your images, recommendations that are gleaned from my forty years behind the camera.</p>

<p>Priced at just $4.99, each eBook can be kept on your iPod Touch, iPhone, iPad, laptop or other electronic device, so it’s always handy.</p>

<p><a href="http://blog.lesterpickerphoto.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/02/LAP6601-20x30.jpg"><img class="alignnone size-medium wp-image-1999" title="Sally Lightfoot crab, Galapagos" src="http://blog.lesterpickerphoto.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/02/LAP6601-20x30-300x200.jpg" alt="" width="300" height="200"></a></p>

<p>Try one by clicking <a href="http://shop.lesterpickerphoto.com/page/103">here</a> and you’ll be taken to a descriptive page where you’ll be able to place your order. Once again, I warn you. These eBooks are addictive!</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>(Part of a series on Finland)</p>

<p>One of the activities I looked forward to the most while in Finland was a two-day dog-sledding adventure, taking off from the Harriniva Holiday Centre, about 45 minutes out of Kittela. In turn, Kittela is a 90-minute plane ride from Helsinki, so it’s a fair bit of effort to get to this region, located well inside the Arctic Circle.</p>

<h3>Harraniva</h3>


<p>Harraniva is a multi-purpose, multi-season resort run by the grandchildren of the family that founded it in 1973. As such, it boasts a true home-style atmosphere. At any point you might be approached by one of the brothers or sisters that currently run this jewel of a resort and asked about how your stay is going.</p>

<p>If you love cold weather activities, Harraniva is one of the top places to go in Finland, offering cross-country skiing, snowmobiling, snowshoeing, dog-sledding, reindeer sledding and more. While I was there, it was filled with families, mostly Finns and Swedes. Harraniva is located on the Muonio River that borders Sweden and is one of several vacation properties the family owns.</p>

<p><strong>The Adventure Begins</strong></p>

<p>Just as soon as I arrived, I was escorted to the equipment building, where a group of other mushers was already being outfitted. Since I frequent extreme cold weather places, I already had all the gear I needed with me. Had I known what Harraniva offered, I would gladly have left my extra bag at home. As is, I decided to try their outer gear, which proved to be excellent.</p>

<p>As part of their tours, Harraniva supplies woolen socks, insulated boots, insulated overalls and parka, gloves, mittens, scarves, hats and balaclavas (sort of like a high-tech sock that fits over your head, protecting everything but your eyes). Outfitting the group of us took a while, but the staff insisted on everything fitting properly. If there is one thing I’ve learned in my cold weather jaunts, it’s to have the right equipment, properly fitted.</p>

<p>Outfitted, we then walked a few hundred yards to the kennels where 430 sled dogs are born, bred and maintained for the sledding tours. The dogs are divided into eight packs, each one supervised by a master musher and his assistants.</p>

<p>Basically, there are two types of sled dogs. One is, of course, the purebred Siberian husky. The other is the Alaskan husky, which is the term applied to any sled dog of mixed husky breed. If you’ve never heard the eagerness of sled dogs ready to run, you’re in for a surprise. These dogs are happiest when they are on the trail, doing what it is they were bred for. <a href="http://youtu.be/DgxPo4uYJUk">Here, for example, is a short video of them waiting to pull the sled during one of our stops.</a></p>

<p>After some preliminary instructions, we were off, divided into two groups, each with its own professional guide. My group was guided by Raikka (pronounced “Reekee” with a rolling R). The other was guided by Markko. Each turned out to be a unique and colorful character.</p>

<h3>On the Trail</h3>


<p>No sooner had we left Harraniva lodge, then we ran into a snowstorm. Fortunately, the terrain was flat for the first few kilometers, allowing the novice mushers a chance to get a feel for maneuvering their sleds. These dogs didn’t change their pace by voice command. They simply run, either quickly while going downhill, or slowly while pulling their sleds uphill. The trick is learning to maneuver the sled. That involves leaning one way or the other into turns, deftly applying the brakes as needed and jumping off the sled and walking behind it while going up steep grades.</p>

<p>With the snow coming down heavily and the temperatures dropping, we entered the snowy woods. There is nothing that can quite compare with the flat, <a href="http://youtu.be/i3hWGuPZB0s">crystal fairyland forests of Lapland</a> (watch this short video I took on the back of my sled)). They are strikingly gorgeous, the trees covered as they are with thick layers of snow and ice. When the dogs are running, the only sounds you hear are their panting and the swoosh of the sled over the snow.</p>

<p>Our goal that first day was to run an easy 25 km (15 miles), although the going was made more difficult by the sometimes blinding snow. The added wind from traveling lowered the chill factor and nearly everyone was battened down, with only eyes exposed. It’s virtually impossible to wear goggles under these conditions because they fog up and are covered in melting snowflakes.</p>

<p>In the far north (we were about 200 km above the Arctic Circle), the sun- when it is out- hangs low in the sky the entire day, providing a soft, warm glow to the snow. Sunglasses are rarely needed.</p>

<p>In about two hours, Raikka stopped our group next to a wooden teepee. There were outhouses available and while we staked our teams to prevent them from running off, Raikka and Markko started a roaring log fire in the middle of the large teepee and prepared us a hot meal of pan-fried salmon served on potato bread, hot tea or coffee and cookies. Refreshed, we were back on the trail an hour later.</p>

<p>So the rest of the day went, with Raikka using hand signals indicating when we needed to slow down, stop or just plain be cautious due to trail conditions. In another few hours, as dusk fell, we arrived at our cabin for the night.</p>

<h3>The Cabin Experience</h3>


<p>In dogsledding, the adventure includes dog care, so as soon as we reached camp we unhitched the dogs, tied them to stakes for the night, fed and watered them, while Raikka and Markko made sure they were in good health. Only when that was done did we move our gear into the cabins.</p>

<p>Some of the cabins along the five-day safaris have no electricity. Ours did, allowing the guides to cook us a scrumptious dinner, with a large wood stove keeping us very warm. Cabin time is a chance to get to know everyone, and our geographic diversity was amazing, including Italy, Germany, Holland, Finland, Spain, Russia and the U.S.A. Fortunately for me, everyone spoke at least some English. Since Finnish is only spoken in Finland, Finns learn at least two other languages in school. Most everyone chooses English as one of those languages, so travel in Finland is easy for English speakers.</p>

<p>Immediately after dinner, we went separately as groups of men and women to the sauna that was a few yards from the cabin. When the men were done, we came out just as the Northern lights were making a feeble attempt to appear. Within minutes the skies clouded over. Another photographer and I stayed up until 3:00AM hoping in vain for their return.</p>

<p>The women bedded down in one room, while the men went upstairs to the loft to sleep. In about five minutes, everyone was asleep in the sleeping bags we were issued. It probably took me all of a minute to doze off once I crawled into my sleeping bag at 3:00.</p>

<p><strong>The Final Clicks</strong></p>

<p>After a hearty breakfast, and dog care, we were off again.</p>

<p><a href="http://blog.lesterpickerphoto.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/02/A0017831.jpg"><img class="size-medium wp-image-1992" title="A0017831" src="http://blog.lesterpickerphoto.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/02/A0017831-300x225.jpg" alt="" width="300" height="225"></a></p>

<p>The route back covered 35 km (22 miles). Given that the group had gained experience, we made better time coming back. But, confidence sometimes breeds carelessness. On a steep downhill run, a slightly built, 61-year old woman in our group lost control of her sled and it crashed into a tree. She had the wind knocked out of her, but after 30 minutes she was back on her sled, a real trooper in our collective opinion.</p>

<p>Our sledding ended back at Harriniva just as the sun was setting. What we did not know then is that <a href="http://blog.lesterpickerphoto.com/2012/02/19/northern-lights/">a real aurora light show would greet us</a> once we washed up and did the obligatory sauna.</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>Visit Finland in winter and you&#8217;ll get an idea of why Finns are rated amongst the healthiest people on the planet. No, it has nothing to do with their admittedly excellent health care system, in my opinion. Here are my top reasons, in order of&#8230; nothing.</p>

<p><strong>Clothing</strong>. If you wore 17 layers of clothes every day just to go from your house to Helsinki&#8217;s wonderful bus or trolley system, you&#8217;d burn calories faster than a mouse on a treadmill. In Lapland, it&#8217;s 26 layers and waddling is a proven calorie-burner.</p>

<p><strong>Walking</strong>. Finns walk everywhere. If they don&#8217;t walk they ski. Or snowshoe. Or, in Lapland, maybe hitch up a dog team and run it 50 kilometers to the grocery store. Apparently, those activities are good for the heart.</p>

<p><strong>Walking on Helsinki sidewalks</strong>. If New Yorkers had to put up with walking on snow-covered sidewalks like Helsinkians do, there would be a major revolution from my friends in Brooklyn. Fuggedaboudit. I spent three days in Helsinki and during that time it snowed twice. Amazingly, very, very few storekeepers bothered to shovel, even in major shopping districts. Since it is so cold, the snow does not turn to wet slush. Instead it pulverizes into a grungy, sand-like quality. Ever try walking on a sandy beach? This alone makes Finns strong like bulls. This is just a small example of what I mean, two days after a snowfall.</p>

<p><a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WGxU5_mGnLs&amp;feature=youtube_gdata_player">http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WGxU5_mGnLs&amp;feature=youtube_gdata_player</a></p>

<p><strong>Sauna</strong>. Finns will sauna at the drop of a hat&#8230; or clothes. Trust me on this one.</p>

<p><strong>Fish</strong>. Finns eat fish. Lots of fish. I had steamed salmon, grilled salmon, smoked salmon, broiled salmon, salmon salad, even poached salmon. Having gills must take a load off one&#8217;s lungs.</p>

<p><a href="http://blog.lesterpickerphoto.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/02/photo.jpg"><img class="size-medium wp-image-1982" title="photo" src="http://blog.lesterpickerphoto.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/02/photo-300x225.jpg" alt="" width="300" height="225"></a></p>

<p><strong>Reindeer</strong>. Finns also eat a lot of reindeer, so there must be something healthy about it, too. I wonder if they abstain around Christmas time?</p>

<p><strong>Cold Air</strong>. When it&#8217;s -35C outside in winter, it tends to weed out the weaker members of the species. Those left standing are called Finns.</p>

<p>So, that&#8217;s my health report from Finland. And, please pass the tartar sauce.</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>During my stay here in Finland, the weather has been, shall I say, uncooperative&#8230; photographically, that is. The skiers are in heaven, since a lot of snow has fallen. However, for me the weather has been mostly overcast and snowy, limiting my photographic possibilities.</p>

<p>I&#8217;ve only had two days of decent or partially decent weather, but oh, were they grand! One evening the skies put on a show-of-shows. Right before dinner, starting at around 5:30 PM, a colleague and I rushed outside as the Aurora Borealis began to form. Here is a an image I took at dusk.</p>

<p><a href="http://blog.lesterpickerphoto.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/02/LAP4486.jpg"><img class="alignnone size-medium wp-image-1972" title="_LAP4486" src="http://blog.lesterpickerphoto.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/02/LAP4486-300x199.jpg" alt="" width="300" height="199"></a></p>

<p>Now I don&#8217;t know how many of you have experienced The Lights, but all I can say is that there is no other such experience on earth. It is awesome and humbling at the same time. The first time I witnessed them, in Dawson City, Yukon Territory, I wept. They are that incredible.</p>

<p>But every time I have been privileged to see them since, I feel the same degree of awe. They are science&#8217;s portal to the spiritual. I can see how indigenous cultures deified this phenomenon.</p>

<p>Anyway, back to Kittila, Finland, where these images were taken. As I stood on the banks of the Muonio River that separates Finland from Sweden, the skies quickly darkened and the lights came out in full glory. Here is another image, taken from the identical spot on the property of the Harriniva Hotel, just 30 minutes later.</p>

<p><a href="http://blog.lesterpickerphoto.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/02/LAP4502.jpg"><img class="alignnone size-medium wp-image-1974" title="_LAP4502" src="http://blog.lesterpickerphoto.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/02/LAP4502-199x300.jpg" alt="" width="199" height="300"></a></p>

<p>I promised more information on my images this year and in this case the best way I know how to provide that is to refer you to a <a href="http://blog.lesterpickerphoto.com/2011/02/15/how-to-photograph-the-northern-lights/">previous blog I wrote</a> on taking Aurora images.</p>

<p>In eight days I only had one night of good aurora photography, and then it only lasted about 90 minutes, before it became overcast again. Still, how can anyone complain? I&#8217;d easily wait a week again for an hour&#8217;s worth of pure magic.</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>I figure this is something you do once, just to get it out of your system. If you think about coming back again, I’ll recommend my step-son, who is a terrific psychoanalyst.</p>

<p>Here’s the concept. You get to sleep in an unheated building carved from pure ice and resurrected every year anew, so that in no way is the hotel the same every year. You sleep on a bed made of ice. Simple, eh? Think sleeping in your freezer. And I’ll bet you thought travel journalism is all fun and games.</p>

<h3>The Snow Village</h3>


<p>Last night I slept in The Snow Village Hotel located in Lainio, Finland (<a href="http://www.snowvillage.fi">www.snowvillage.fi</a>). It’s nuttier than all get-out, but it’s something I’ve wanted to do for at least 20 years, ever since I first heard of it. You all know that I’m partial to cold weather environments. Since I was going to Finland anyway to do some photography, I figured I’d finally get my chance. And so I booked into the hotel, sometimes known as the ice palace.</p>

<p>The scoop is that every November, here in Finalnd’s north which is known as Lapland, a group of local workers cut blocks of crystal clear ice from the local river situated about 150 meters from the Snow Village. With these blocks, each of which weighs anywhere from 200 to 500 pounds, they lay a foundation and begin to build using some ingenious techniques.</p>

<p>For example, they build a large, domed “chapel” with a ceiling that is at least 25 feet high. They do this by blowing up a huge balloon, then spraying a chemical-free, secret mixture of snow and water over the balloon. It’s so cold in Lapland in November, the structure freezes solid in three hours. They deflate the balloon and continue adding ice until the walls are 18-32 inches thick.</p>

<p><a href="http://blog.lesterpickerphoto.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/02/LAP45252.jpg"><img class="size-medium wp-image-1963" title="_LAP4525" src="http://blog.lesterpickerphoto.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/02/LAP45252-199x300.jpg" alt="" width="199" height="300"></a></p>

<p>Using prefabbed molds they then build the arched walkways of the hotel, from which radiate the 25 individual guest rooms. When the walls are thickened and hardened, they bring in the folks who work long days and nights to carve the various ice statues and wall carvings that are unique to each room.</p>

<p>Amazingly, they do all this within four weeks. This past year it was slightly above zero well into November. Delayed to the last minute, the owners brought in carvers from China to finish the hotel in record time- 2-1/2 weeks!</p>

<p><a href="http://blog.lesterpickerphoto.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/02/LAP45201.jpg"><img class="size-medium wp-image-1964" title="_LAP4520" src="http://blog.lesterpickerphoto.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/02/LAP45201-300x199.jpg" alt="" width="300" height="199"></a></p>

<h3>Settling In</h3>


<p>Guests are given an orientation to the Village, which is an active tourist’s paradise. The Hotel runs snowmobile tours, dogsledding tours, reindeer tours, snowshoeing and cross-country skiing tours. It does have heated cabins on the property, but I wouldn’t be writing this if that’s all they had.</p>

<p>The hotel offers an ice bar and restaurant. Seriously folks, you can order drinks or an entire meal, served to you by waitresses wearing down jackets, woolen caps and mittens. At least I think they were waitresses. Could’ve been waiters, now that I think of it.</p>

<p><a href="http://blog.lesterpickerphoto.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/02/B00178871.jpg"><img class="size-medium wp-image-1965" title="B0017887" src="http://blog.lesterpickerphoto.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/02/B00178871-300x225.jpg" alt="" width="300" height="225"></a></p>

<p>There is also a normal, heated restaurant on the property.  But, you’re probably wondering what it’s like sleeping in a room naturally at -5 Celsius (that’s about 23F), on a bed made of a solid block of ice. Well, it’s…</p>

<h3>The Big Prep</h3>


<p>First a bit of prep. You are given a well made mummy sleeping bag guaranteed to -30F. You also have a freshly washed liner and a pillow. Then follows the advice. Wear your long johns, maybe two pairs if you get cold easily while you sleep. Wear a stocking cap, even though the sleeping bag has a tight drawstring for the head area and all that is exposed are your eyes.</p>

<p>Oh, and bring your gloves, just in case. Wow, this is getting better and better by the minute.</p>

<p>Oh, obviously you can’t have a heated bathroom or dressing area in an ice hotel. Can you? No, you cannot, so the heated changing area is down the arched corridor and then you open two heavy wooden doors and then you run outside about 100 yards to the dressing, bathroom and shower building. Hmmm, interesting.</p>

<p>Oh, and it might not be a good idea to drink before going to bed - actually anytime near bedtime, because, well, you know. It was forecast to be minus 30C (-22F) that night. I decided not to drink after noon.</p>

<p>Oh, and your shoes. I forgot about those. Obviously you’ll leave them next to your “bed,” so on the odd chance that you do get up during the night to pee, you’ll find them a tad bit cold.</p>

<p><a href="http://blog.lesterpickerphoto.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/02/B00178861.jpg"><img class="size-medium wp-image-1969" title="B0017886" src="http://blog.lesterpickerphoto.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/02/B00178861-300x225.jpg" alt="" width="300" height="225"></a></p>

<h3>The Verdict</h3>


<p>So, how was it, you ask? Before the penultimate answer, I’ll quickly describe the process of going to sleep&#8230; in an ice hotel, that is.</p>

<p>I went to the warm dressing building fully clothed, with my polar down jacket on, hat and gloves, as it was -24C (-11F) and falling rapidly. I washed up and changed into two pairs of long johns, socks and my wool cap. I donned a pair of slippers, grabbed my sleeping bag and dashed across the 100 longest meters/yards of my life to the ice hotel guest rooms, where it was a balmy -5C (+23F). In a scene from an old-time movie, in double time I spread my sleeping bag, crawled into the liner, zipped up and pulled the head covering cord tightly, so that only my eyes and nose showed. I closed my eyes and realized… I was too hot! I mean way too hot.</p>

<p>I waited about 30 minutes and shed my extra long johns, closed my eyes, and&#8230; woke up in the morning feeling terrific! I remember a few times during the night breathing the delightfully crisp, cold air. The insulated mattress under me was comfortable, too.</p>

<h3>A Hearty Breakfast</h3>


<p>Finlanders know a thing or two about breakfasts. Healthy, hearty breakfasts. They know how cold demands calories. Breakfasts are a lavish affair. Breakfast smorgasbords are the rule, filled with yogurt, berries, citrus, oatmeal and other porridges, dark breads (as well as light), and the usual assortment of eggs and breakfast meats.</p>

<p>The Snow Hotel is fortunate to have Ella Kurtakko in the kitchen. Each summer she gathers 150 quarts of blueberries and another blue berry native to Scandinavia and makes the most incredible dark blue juice you can imagine. That’s served hot and the feel of it in your mouth is indescribable.</p>

<p>The Snow Hotel is not luxurious by any means, but it is up to European expectations. For example, it has but one tiny bathroom serving the entire reception, restaurant and bar area. The entranceway to the hotel is so unadorned, it looks like a Soviet-era clinic. There is no Internet service but, really, why would you want it in such exquisite surroundings?</p>

<p><a href="http://blog.lesterpickerphoto.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/02/B00178661.jpg"><img class="size-medium wp-image-1966" title="B0017866" src="http://blog.lesterpickerphoto.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/02/B00178661-225x300.jpg" alt="" width="225" height="300"></a></p>

<p>So, if you’re in Finland, you might want to try The Snow Village. Once.</p>

<p>As for me, I do plan to return with some friends. As soon as I post this story, I’ll call my therapist stepson to see if he’ll give me a family discount.</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>Just today I received a wonderful email from a man I just happened to run into a few months back in Valley of Fire State Park in Nevada. I was busily photographing the glorious rock formations in this jewel of a park, when a man approached me and told me I looked remarkably like Ansel Adams, hunched over my camera as I was.</p>

<p>How to take that comment? I was flattered beyond words, hoping that he did not mean that I looked half-dead. But this man, Bob Stowe, was in town for a conference and he seemed like a nice guy. We chatted a while about photography. Bob was sporting a nice camera and looked like he was having a grand time during his afternoon off.</p>

<p>After he left, I went back to my photography, unaware that Bob took a photo of me taking photos. Well, Bob wrote to me today and here&#8217;s what he said:</p>

<p><em>&#8220;I met you at the Nevada Valley of Fire state park in mid November.  I saw you patiently waiting to take a picture through a circular hole in the sandstone.  I thought at a distance you looked remarkably like Ansel Adams resurrected, to which you replied that you well might be! I have a picture of you that I would like to share with you.&#8221;</em></p>

<p>Bob, I&#8217;d like to publicly thank you. What a nice thing to do!</p>

<p>Now, even nice gestures sometimes create conundrums. and this one created a B-I-G one for me. Bob sent three versions of the image and told me to choose whichever one I wanted. Fair enough. One was the original color shot. The second image Bob rendered in B&amp;W. And the third&#8230; well here is where it gets sticky.</p>

<p>The third image Bob processed in sepia tone, conveying the old-timey feel of Ansel Adam&#8217;s time. This, Bob confided in me, was his wife&#8217;s favorite rendition. Ah, and now I&#8217;m supposed to pick one, eh Bob? So, in the interests of marital harmony and the higher purposes of life, I decided on&#8230; the sepia one, naturally (click on the image to enlarge).</p>

<p><a href="http://blog.lesterpickerphoto.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/02/LesterAnselAdamsSepia-2.jpg"><img class="size-medium wp-image-1950" title="LesterAnselAdamsSepia-2" src="http://blog.lesterpickerphoto.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/02/LesterAnselAdamsSepia-2-300x200.jpg" alt="" width="300" height="200"></a></p>

<p>Teasing aside, thanks to Bob (and Ruth) for the gift. Have a great week!</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>This weekend I leave for a week-long assignment in Finland. I’ll mostly be in Lapland, but I’ll also have a couple of days in Helsinki, too. Despite winter temps around -15F in Lapland, I’m really looking forward to this trip. Crazy as it is, I love the frigid far north in winter. Its ethereal beauty is hard to explain and if you’re not into extreme cold it’s even harder to understand.</p>

<p>One of the things I have planned is a two-day dogsled safari. For those of you who have followed my Yukon adventures, you know I love dogsledding, and I’m particularly eager to experience it in Lapland.</p>

<p>I’m also going to do something corny that I’ve wanted to try for at least 20 years now. I booked myself into the weird and whacky Snow Hotel. Believe it or not, the Finns build this snow village every winter and actually carve out rooms and suites, a restaurant, an Ice Bar, slides and tons of ice sculptures. I’ll actually get to sleep on an ice bed, which is covered with specially insulated material so that people report it is actually toasty warm. Okay, forget the toasty part.</p>

<p>My guess is that I won’t get to sleep in it much, though, because my intention is to be out every night trying to photograph the Northern Lights, which are reported to be putting on quite a show this year.</p>

<p><a href="http://blog.lesterpickerphoto.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/02/LAP1127.jpg"><img class="size-medium wp-image-1946" title="_LAP1127" src="http://blog.lesterpickerphoto.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/02/LAP1127-300x199.jpg" alt="" width="300" height="199"></a></p>

<p>In any event, you’ll be able to follow me again in real time on my travels. I’ll have my SPOT GPS with me and, as usual, I’ll blog from the frozen northlands. While I’m gone, please do me a favor. Stay warm!</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>If you’re a photographer, listen up! Do I have a deal for you!!</p>

<p>To help celebrate Photographers’ Month at my favorite outdoor clothing website— <a href="http://www.scottevest.com">ScotteVest</a> — I’m giving away a brand new Classic ScotteVest to one of our blog visitors! Just be sure to enter <strong>by February 29</strong>. Winners will be announced on March 1.</p>

<p><strong>UPDATE</strong>: The contest is ending soon, folks, so enter your best few images ASAP! There are two main prizes (and who knows what else might be in store for you brave entrants?).</p>

<h3>The Classic ScotteVest</h3>


<p>Why should you want to win this contest? Simply because, in my opinion (humble or otherwise), the Classic ScotteVest is… well, a classic. It has 22 pockets—  count ‘em— with features that never cease to amaze me. There are pockets for my iPhone, point-and-shoot camera, water bottle, sunglasses, pens and passport, even an iPad!</p>

<p><img src="http://www.scottevest.com/media/img/p_tvestm-desert-sand_ndx.jpg" alt="Classic Vest for Men" width="200" height="200"><a href="http://blog.lesterpickerphoto.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/02/pr_scott.jpg"><img class="size-full wp-image-1937" title="pr_scott" src="http://blog.lesterpickerphoto.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/02/pr_scott.jpg" alt="" width="200" height="200"></a></p>

<p>I’ve owned one of these puppies for years and it allows me to breeze through airport security. And here is a little secret; I get to shed about five pounds of technology from my suitcase so I don’t get charged $100 extra (round trip, of course… what a bargain!). The vest is so well balanced I hardly feel it and ScotteVest’s “No Bulge” system keeps everything out of site. Plus, I get to have all my essentials with me.</p>

<p><img src="http://www.scottevest.com/media/img/p_tvestw-desert-sand_ndx.jpg" alt="Travel Vest for Women" width="200" height="200"></p>

<p>The vest sells for $100 online. The winner of my contest will have his or her choice of color and size. Check out the<a href="http://www.scottevest.com/v3_store/New_Travel_Vest.shtml"> men’s vest</a> and the <a href="http://www.scottevest.com/v3_store/New_Travel_Vest_Women.shtml">women’s vest</a>.</p>

<h3>Disclaimer</h3>


<p>I make no bones about, I&#8217;m proud to be the ScotteVest photography columnist on their website. I make no money on anything sold by ScotteVest. I collaborate with them simply because I believe in their products and use their clothing every time I take a photo trip (actually, I also wear their Hoodie at home on chilly days). I was a customer of theirs long before I agreed to do a photography column for them. I do get to test out some of their gear. It’s not only some of the best made outdoor clothing I have ever used, but it’s THE most thoughtfully made. ‘Nuf said.</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>I am so tired of seeing very capable people produce b-o-r-i-n-g photos. The same tourist locations, the same angles, the same composition, the same, same, same!</p>

<p>So, several years ago I got to wondering if there was a better way to help people get beyond boring and into more dynamic expressions of their photographic creativity. I do think I’ve found one path, but first bear me a little slack.</p>

<p>Admittedly, I’m schizophrenic. I’m frequently forced to witness disturbing battles that rage between my left and right brains.</p>

<p><em>Les, you’ve got to be more organized and develop a system to do this. </em></p>

<p><em>No, I need to be more free-flowing, more daringly creative.</em></p>

<p><em>Les, back off and rethink whether getting that shot out on that ledge is a good idea. </em></p>

<p><em>Oooh, that sunset from that ledge would be so gorgeous</em>… you get my point.</p>

<p>From an early age the two things that have always lighted my passion have been writing and photography. As a 5<sup>th</sup>-grader I won a writing competition and at age 11, my father, an accomplished amateur photographer, gave me my first 35mm camera. Since then, my two passions have caused me endless grief, but also too many sublime moments to count. I have written and photographed for some of the top magazines in the country and in each case I believe that the one creative outlet has helped the other.</p>

<p><a href="http://blog.lesterpickerphoto.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/01/luxorwestbank1-21.jpg"><img class="size-medium wp-image-1926" src="http://blog.lesterpickerphoto.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/01/luxorwestbank1-21-200x300.jpg" alt="" width="200" height="300"></a></p>

<p>So, here is my proposed solution to improve your photography. Write a story, and then tell it through your lens. No, I mean it. Cultivate the written side of your creative brain and it might just do wonders for your photography. Let’s see how.</p>

<p>As you travel here and there, take a little notebook and write down your impressions. What captivated you? Was it the people you met, the scenery you saw, the wildlife roaming free in the distance? Use lots of adjectives and adverbs to describe those things. Photography is still primarily a two-dimensional endeavor. Writing puts flesh on the bones, and adds depth and dimensionality to your experience.</p>

<p>The more experience you gain with this process, in other words the more you write, the more you will see the world around you in many hues, in different tonalities, in multiple textures. You will become sensitized to light and movement. You will observe the nuances of wildlife as you have never done before. It’s then the magic begins, perhaps slowly at first, imperceptibly, but it’s there, all right. Your images will stretch to capture the subtleties. You will crave to put on ‘film’ what your senses are recording and in your frustration, you will improve your photographic story-telling or develop new and creative ways to express it.</p>

<p>Suddenly, your images will achieve greater depth. Your color palette will expand or, perhaps even better, shrink to capture the subtle monochromatic tones of a dreary London alleyway. You will selectively blur that animal’s movement to tell your story of its grace. You will wait that extra second for that smudge-faced little girl on a Calcutta street to smile so that you reveal your vision of a more hopeful future.</p>

<p><a href="http://blog.lesterpickerphoto.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/01/LAP0531-1-Edit2.jpg"><img class="size-medium wp-image-1928" src="http://blog.lesterpickerphoto.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/01/LAP0531-1-Edit2-199x300.jpg" alt="" width="199" height="300"></a></p>

<p>Writing and photography are like two parts of the whole. The best images I have ever seen somehow speak their truth to me. A picture, after all, if we are lucky, really can be worth a thousand words. The key here is to always ask yourself this question: What is the story you are trying to tell with your image?</p>
