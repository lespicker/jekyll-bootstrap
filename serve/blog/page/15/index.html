  <div class="entry-content"><p>I woke up this morning, poured my tea and started reading the paper. It wasn&#8217;t exactly unexpected, but the headline jumped out and grabbed my heart. Kodak was filing for bankruptcy.</p>

<p>I&#8217;ll try to explain what this means to me. I was brought up on Kodak film. My father, a wonderful photographer (and genuinely nice guy) gave me my first camera and rolls of Kodachrome 25 when I was 11. He was a periodic beta-tester for Kodak film, although he rarely used anything other than K25. His photography around New York City was well known. In fact, a few years ago my sister and I agreed to donate some of his work to the Museum of the City of New York.</p>

<p>I remember my first assignments for National Geographic Society publications were shot on K25 and that newfangled film called Kodachrome 64 (good, but never as good as the legendary K25). Once in a while maybe an Ektachrome here and there, although I never liked its bluish cast and grain.</p>

<p><a href="http://blog.lesterpickerphoto.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/01/4204587687_69578f4798.jpg"><img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-1907" title="4204587687_69578f4798" src="http://blog.lesterpickerphoto.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/01/4204587687_69578f4798.jpg" alt="" width="500" height="366"></a></p>

<p>Once, when I was shooting an assignment on sea turtles, the National Park Service called me while I was at a conference and told me that a Loggerhead Turtle nest had washed out on the Shackleford Banks off the coast of North Carolina. If the eggs were not reburied within hours, the amnion might separate from the shell, killing the young. If I didn&#8217;t get there within two hours, I&#8217;d lose the opportunity to shoot the scene. The problem was that I was on the mainland and would never reach the site in time by boat.</p>

<p>A quick call to my editor in Washington, DC and he gave me the go-ahead to charter a helicopter. Unfortunately, I only had one roll of film with me. In my mad dash to the airport, I ran into a tiny drugstore on the Outer Banks.</p>

<p>&#8220;Do you sell film?&#8221; I asked, breathless.</p>

<p>&#8220;Yep,&#8221; the store owner, pharmacist, shelf stocker, soda fountain jerk, and cashier answered. With that he turned around and took out a fresh pack of film from what we used to call a &#8220;brick&#8221; (20 rolls wrapped in cellophane).</p>

<p>&#8220;No, I&#8217;ll take them all!&#8221; I said, grabbed the brick, tossed down a few $20s and ran out of the store. The guy thought I was nuts. Of course, the only film he sold was good ole Kodachrome  (albeit K64). Thats the kind of standard the Kodak brand was in those days (1978). Boy, how the mighty have fallen.</p>

<p>Kodak was an icon for me. A trusted name in American business for generations. Quality all the way. And now this.</p>

<p>I know I&#8217;m as guilty as anyone. I made the switch to digital 7 or 8 years ago. As expensive as digital is today, I remember my last film assignment I shot cost me $1,600 in developing costs alone!</p>

<p>For the past decade I have watched Kodak&#8217;s steady decline. They just did not anticipate the speed with which digital would eventually dominate. They made some dicey moves, such as getting into the printer business. What hair brained consultant, I wonder, convinced them this was wise? Printers are one of the most competitive businesses in photography, with the likes of  HP, Epson, Canon, and Brother barely holding on. Printers are nearly loss leaders nowadays, giveaways, with the business model depending on us constantly filling the pricey ink tanks to generate profits.</p>

<p>Well, there&#8217;s still hope. Perhaps Kodak will recover from their self-inflicted wounds and emerge healthier. I, for one, will be rooting for them.</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>2011 was a pretty good year… photographically, that is. I was able to fulfill a decades-old desire and delve deep into large format photography, only to find that it does not suit my travel style. Bummer. But I had fun finally tackling that beast and putting it to rest.</p>

<p>It was also the year that I added medium format to my repertoire, and I am enjoying my Hasselblad H4D-50 very, very much. With its 50-megapixel files and extraordinary sensor, I get luscious, film-like images that exceed my expectations.</p>

<p>I was also able to travel to some wonderful places for photography this past year- including Canada’s Yukon Territory, Alaska, Zion National Park and New Mexico. I was able to write about these travels and illustrate them with my images both <a href="http://blog.lesterpickerphoto.com/category/travelogue/">here</a> and for a wide range of commercial newspapers and magazines.</p>

<p>And, as it has been for the past three years, I have enjoyed my interactions with my associate, Bob Boyer, who is truly a very talented guy. He is constantly challenging me on a profession level and making things happen for our business.</p>

<h3>Onward to 2012!</h3>


<p>I look forward to 2012 with excitement and a sense of humility. For one thing, my travels will range far and wide, from U.S. locations to Finland (not finalized yet), Israel, Sri Lanka, Iceland, Norway (also not yet finalized), and Maine. Sadly, a planned photo shoot in Africa in January did not pan out due to unrest in Kenya.</p>

<p>I’m also looking forward to more fully incorporating my <a href="http://blog.lesterpickerphoto.com/2011/11/29/review-of-the-hasselblad-h4d-50/">Hasselblad equipment</a> into my workflow. My <a href="http://blog.lesterpickerphoto.com/2010/07/23/canadian-rockies-deciding-what-photo-equipment-to-take/">Nikon system</a>, which I have been using since 1970, is second nature to me and it’s a blessing when your equipment does not get in the way of your creative vision.</p>

<p>This year we will be upgrading my gallery website and adding very exciting new products, so stay tuned.</p>

<p>I have a <a href="http://www.nikoniansacademy.com/all/viewWorkshop.html?workshop_id=107">terrific photography workshop</a> scheduled for October in Maine’s Acadia National Park under the auspices of Nikonians, where I am a member of their Academy faculty. This 4-day event promises to be full of spectacular fall photo opps in my very favorite National Park.</p>

<p><a href="http://blog.lesterpickerphoto.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/01/LAP2300.jpg"><img class="size-full wp-image-1903" title="_LAP2300" src="http://blog.lesterpickerphoto.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/01/LAP2300.jpg" alt="" width="1024" height="680"></a></p>

<p>However, what I’m most excited about for 2012 is having been chosen the creative artist for a major teaching hospital’s newest wing. Opening in September, this will mean choosing, post-processing and mounting nearly 100 of my images, most of them at 36 x 30 and some much larger. One image, in particular, will run 28 feet in length!</p>

<p>What gives me the most pleasure with this project is working with some of the finest hospital construction experts and interior designers I have ever met, along with some very dedicated and compassionate health care workers. Each image must be chosen with care, since this unit is dedicated to traumatic brain injury patients and their families. It’s a challenge that I relish. Of course, I’ll keep you posted as the project progresses.</p>

<p>I spent the time between Christmas and New Year writing down my photography (and business) goals for the year. The question I have for you is: What are your photographic goals? Are you bold enough to share them with us here?</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p><strong>O</strong>ne man’s sorrow is another man’s joy, or so the saying goes (I assume it applies equally to women). And so it is in the Yukon Territory, where oil, gas and precious metal interests have discovered that the Canadian province may hold vast, untapped resources. That’s good news for the economy and perhaps bad news for the environment. We’ll soon see.</p>

<p>In winter I usually review some of my past year’s work and, lo and behold!, I found some images that I had forgotten about. Without taking a stand on Yukon’s oil and gas exploration, on my trip there last summer, I happened to pass an oil exploration camp that is on hiatus right now, while the corporate execs seek additional investors. We needed a break from driving anyway, so my fellow photographer Richard Hartmier (<a href="http://www.hartmier.com">www.hartmier.com</a>) and I stopped for maybe 30 very rushed minutes to make some photo impressions of the drilling equipment lying in wait. I attached some photo info, but I can’t attach comments to these images since I have no idea what each piece of equipment is or does. But, here is a photo essay, uninformed as it is. All images here were taken hand-held on a Nikon D700, then post-processed into B&amp;W using Lightroom 3 and, in a few cases, Nik Silver Effects.</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>A friend, Morgan Melekos, just sent me this image he took while I was photographing a Vermont stream scene. It was around 1 degree Fahrenheit that day. Although I sometimes have to get into a stream to photograph, I don&#8217;t do so lightly. I advise my readers to always take proper precautions (see the ScotteVest column I did entitled &#8220;Don&#8217;t Take The Plunge!&#8221;: <a href="http://www.scottevest.com/company/photography.shtml">http://www.scottevest.com/company/photography.shtml</a>).</p>

<p>If you are curious, the camera is a Hasselblad H4D-50 with a 28mm lens and a Hasselblad tilt-shift mechanism between the lens and camera. Clothing includes my ScotteVest hoodie sweatshirt (and two layers underneath). My waders are from Orvis (I use soft-soled waders so I can feel the rocks, which I believe helps me from slipping). My tripod is a Gitzo 3541 with a Really Right Stuff BH-55 ballhead.</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>I was visiting my daughter and 3 grandchildren in Vermont&#8217;s Northern Kingdom this past week. The weather was atrocious, not for the cold, but for the fact that an unusually warm couple of days produced rain instead of snow and washed all the snow from the trees. Man, was I bummed! There went my pre-visualization of a snowy stream.</p>

<p>On my last day I had aborted a trek to a beaver pond when I stepped into a marsh and broke through the ice, filling my boot with ice-cold water and marsh muck (hey, it happens!). One thing I learned from teaching winter survival in Maine is not to play loose with winter conditions. I hiked back to my car, thankful for my ScotteVest alpaca wool socks, which kept me warm.</p>

<p>On the drive out of the preservation area I passed this creek and stopped to take a shot. It was late in the day, the sun was fading fast, so I took a few snaps and left. In 2012, at your requests, I will be including more shooting info, as appropriate. Here goes:</p>

<p>Hasselblad H4D-50, 50-110mm lens @ 110mm, 5.0 seconds @ f/22, ISO 50, Gitzo tripod 3541, Really Right Stuff BH-55 head. In post-processing I toned down the highlights just a tad on the right side of the frame.</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>Boredom is good! The interstitial seasonitis doldrums have started, that dreadful time for photographers where we are still blinded by Fall’s colors and the snows of winter have yet to fly. Oh, the boredom, the insatiable itchy trigger finger!</p>

<p>Well, you can relieve that boredom with Les Picker’s tried-and-true doldrums destroyer. It’s called an aquarium. Not just any aquarium, but a dry aquarium, aka a terrarium. Here’s what I mean.</p>

<p>Buy a used aquarium (5-10 gallons should suffice) at a yard sale. If one side or other is cracked, so much the better; it’ll cost you less. Go home and clean the glass sides thoroughly… and I mean thoroughly, so that not a speck of dirt or a smudge remains.</p>

<p>Now, carefully fill it with earth, clumps of grass, dried weeds, for whatever scene you’d like to create. Put a fine mesh cover on top of the terrarium. Stick your camera on a tripod right next to a glass side. Add a macro lens or some inexpensive extension rings. Now, add some creepy-crawly things and, voila!, you have a made-to-order boredom reliever.</p>

<p><strong><em>[Warning</em></strong><em>: bringing cold or frozen soil from outside into your warm house will probably cause lots of little critters to hatch and emerge. Hey, that’s good. You’ll never know what new photographic subjects will suddenly be crawling in your aquarium.]</em></p>

<p>Case in point: last year my wife’s tomato plants were bugged by bugs. Not your garden variety (pardon the puns). These bugs were huge. They are called Tomato Hornworms and, while colorful… in fact gorgeous… I hate competition for my wife’s prized tomatoes. These “worms” metamorphose into the spectacular caterpillars you see here.</p>

<p><a href="http://blog.lesterpickerphoto.com/wp-content/uploads/2011/12/LAP3274.jpg" class="lightview" data-lightview-options="skin: 'mac'">
<figure><img src="http://blog.lesterpickerphoto.com/wp-content/uploads/2011/12/LAP3274.jpg">
</figure></a></p>

<p>So, I picked off a few and plunked them into my terrarium. I started to photograph them. Lots of fun. Then, to my amazement, something extraordinary began to happen right before my eyes. While photographing one afternoon, I saw something live emerging from the skin of the worm! Soon, other wiggly things began to emerge. Within hours the poor Hornworm was covered with these translucent worms.</p>

<p><a href="http://blog.lesterpickerphoto.com/wp-content/uploads/2011/12/LAP3549.jpg" class="lightview" data-lightview-options="skin: 'mac'">
<figure><img src="http://blog.lesterpickerphoto.com/wp-content/uploads/2011/12/LAP3549.jpg">
</figure></a></p>

<p>Within minutes of emerging, these tiny creatures spun a cocoon around themselves, all the while attached to the Hornworm. After two weeks of enduring what must be a painful demise, the Hornworm caterpillar died and the cocoons dropped off into the soil.</p>

<p><a href="http://blog.lesterpickerphoto.com/wp-content/uploads/2011/12/LAP3591.jpg" class="lightview" data-lightview-options="skin: 'mac'">
<figure><img src="http://blog.lesterpickerphoto.com/wp-content/uploads/2011/12/LAP3591.jpg">
</figure></a></p>

<p>What I learned after some research is that the tiny wigglies are the larvae of a miniature and harmless (to humans, that is) wasp. On a nice summer’s day the wasp lands on the Hornworm caterpillar and injects its eggs under its victim’s skin, along with a virus that is thought to delay the maturation of the eggs into the larvae (so as to give the caterpillar a chance to fatten up). Over the next few weeks the eggs transform into a larva. At the end of the season the larvae emerge, take sustenance from the caterpillar’s body, form cocoons that drop into the soil, go through another metamorphosis into wasps and emerge again in the spring. Is that neat, or what? I’d never have learned about this parasitic lifecycle if not for boredom.</p>

<p><a href="http://blog.lesterpickerphoto.com/wp-content/uploads/2011/12/LAP3429.jpg" class="lightview" data-lightview-options="skin: 'mac'">
<figure><img src="http://blog.lesterpickerphoto.com/wp-content/uploads/2011/12/LAP3429.jpg">
</figure></a></p>

<p>So, what will you do with your photo doldrums this year? Complain? Whine? Be short-tempered with your wife and kids? Not any more. Boredom is good!</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>I’ve been visiting global cold weather spots for many years and there is no question in my mind that climate change is occurring. From melting permafrost to retreating glaciers, I see this every time I venture north.</p>

<p>I am not taking sides on how much is human-induced and how much is naturally occurring. From the data I have seen so far, I am convinced that human activity has accelerated this process. But I also believe that more research is needed on this vital issue that will affect humanity and our natural world for perhaps thousands of years.</p>

<p>An article on melting permafrost in today’s <a href="http://www.nytimes.com/2011/12/17/science/earth/warming-arctic-permafrost-fuels-climate-change-worries.html?_r=1&amp;hp">New York Times</a> triggered a memory for me of my most recent visit to the Yukon Territory in Canada’s northern regions. Driving on the famed Dempster Highway I noticed for the first time immense tree slides occurring on mountainsides.</p>

<p>In fact, I stopped at one point to take a quick snapshot of a relatively small one.</p>

</figure></a></p>

<p>These slides are occurring with increasing frequency throughout the polar region, as the permafrost melts and shallow-rooted trees on hillsides give way, especially after summer rains. It’s a real pity to see such devastation and scarring happening in such pristine and fragile environments.</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>I guess it was bound to happen. After years of pounding the trails with a 30-lb camera pack on my back, several months ago I developed Plantar fasciitis. It&#8217;s now been 4 months of treatment including two rounds of cortisone injections, icing the affected area, anti-inflammatory meds and $550 worth of orthotics and I&#8217;m still in pain. I just left the podiatrist&#8217;s office today and will now begin a 6-week try at physical therapy before we go to DEFCON 6, which I understand to be a radical therapy involving beating the bottoms of my feet with electrical shock waves. Ooowie! Sounds like fun.</p>

<p>Anyway, on the extremely remote chance that you might be interested, the plantar fascia, to quote PubMed, is &#8220;&#8230;a very thick band of tissue that covers the bones on the bottom of the foot. It extends from the heel to the bones of the ball of the foot and acts like a rubber band to create tension which maintains the arch of the foot. If the band is long it allows the arch of the foot to be low, which is most commonly known as having a flat foot. A short band of tissue causes a high arch. This fascia can become inflamed and painful in some people, making walking more difficult.&#8221;</p>

<div></div>


<div>The problem for me is that I still have to bring back the goods, so I end up re-injuring the foot (now both feet). Makes no difference if I&#8217;m hiking in Zion National Park with my 30+ pounds of camera gear or walking the streets of NYC as I did a few weeks ago. By the end of the day I&#8217;m in pain.</div>


<div></div>


<div>If any of you have experience with Plantar fasciitis, please let me know how you cured it. In the meantime, please send your good wishes into the ether that the physical therapy works. I&#8217;d like to avoid DEFCON 6 if at all possible.</div>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>I continue to test out my Hasselblad H4D-50 as I prepare for a major installation of my work in a Baltimore teaching hospital. Part of that installation will involve taking images of iconic Baltimore scenes, a process that Bob (my associate) and I have already begun. Whenever the weather is nice we run down to Baltimore and grab some shots, each time hopefully ticking off another site from our lengthy list.</p>

<p>Here are a few images taken with the Hassy, along with some background info for those of you who might be interested. The images have not been seriously post-processed, but they have been tweaked as part of our experimentation. All images were taken tripod-mounted.</p>

<p>As always, your comments, positive or negative, are welcome.</p>

<p>This image of the iconic Domino Sugars sign in Baltimore&#8217;s Inner Harbor was taken at twilight. ISO 200, f8, 1/8 sec, 50-110 lens @ 110mm. No post-processing used.</p>

<p><a href="http://blog.lesterpickerphoto.com/wp-content/uploads/2011/12/B0017446-Edit.jpg"><img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-1816" title="B0017446-Edit" src="http://blog.lesterpickerphoto.com/wp-content/uploads/2011/12/B0017446-Edit.jpg" alt="" width="1024" height="768"></a></p>

<p>Another shot of the sign and factory after dark. ISO 200, f5.6, .3 sec, 50-110 lens @ 70mm. No post-processing with exception of neon sign itself, which Bob had to restore to its original color &amp; illumination in PhotoShop.</p>

<p><a href="http://blog.lesterpickerphoto.com/wp-content/uploads/2011/12/A0017573-Edit.jpg"><img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-1817" title="A0017573-Edit" src="http://blog.lesterpickerphoto.com/wp-content/uploads/2011/12/A0017573-Edit.jpg" alt="" width="768" height="1024"></a></p>

<p>This shot of The Peabody Institute&#8217;s library (part of The Johns Hopkins University) was taken with existing light only. The Peabody library is one of my favorite locations in Baltimore. Due to its Harry Potter-esque imagery, I tweaked it a bit with tonal adjustment in Nik software. ISO 100, f32, 32 sec, 28mm. I cannot believe that the people in the image stood/sat in one place long enough to register on the image!</p>

<p><a href="http://blog.lesterpickerphoto.com/wp-content/uploads/2011/12/A0017553-Edit.jpg"><img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-1818" title="A0017553-Edit" src="http://blog.lesterpickerphoto.com/wp-content/uploads/2011/12/A0017553-Edit.jpg" alt="" width="1024" height="768"></a></p>

<p>This shot was also taken with existing light only. I shot this with my Hassy 28mm lens, which is the 35mm equivalent of 22mm (wow, that does sound confusing; I&#8217;ll explain it in a future blog). I did not use my tilt-shift mechanism, which explains the walls leaning backwards. I plan to reshoot it next week. Still, I kind of like the image. What do you think?</p>

<p>Again, I tweaked this with tonal adjustments in Nik software. ISO 200, f11, 1 sec, 28mm lens. I shot at ISO 200 so I&#8217;d have a chance at capturing the students studying in the cubicles.</p>
