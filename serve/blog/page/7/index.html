  <div class="entry-content"><p>This blog has nothing to do with photography. It has much to do with life. As we travel our individual path, we are sometimes- rarely- fortunate enough to meet up with a person whose very presence can change you in deep and meaningful ways. Such a person in my life is Barbara Higgins, known as Xwu&#8217;p&#8217;a&#8217;lich to her fellow tribal members.</p>

<p><a href="http://blog.lesterpickerphoto.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/11/IMG_0388.jpg"><img class="size-medium wp-image-2454 " title="IMG_0388" src="http://blog.lesterpickerphoto.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/11/IMG_0388-225x300.jpg" alt="" width="225" height="300"></a></p>

<p>Barb is an elder and a revered traditional healer and medicine woman for her Coast Salish First Nation&#8217;s tribe on Canada&#8217;s Sunshine Coast. I could sing her praises for this entire blog, but that&#8217;s not my purpose. Suffice it to say that she is wise beyond her years and, my guess is, she has been that way for her entire life.</p>

<p>I have been fortunate to sit in her living room, travel with her, canoe with her, sing and drum with her. I have attended the all-day coming of age ceremony for her grandson, Robert. I have witnessed her, her daughter Holly, and Robert singing and drumming on a Sunshine Coast beach as their spirits connected with a gray whale and slowly brought it ever closer to us. My wife, our granddaughter and I stood in watching in amazement, until it was but 50 yards offshore, its vaporous breath resonating in our ears. But, most all, what I love about Barb is her story-telling. People sit around the proverbial (and sometimes virtual) fire pit, spellbound, as she weaves her tales, usually from childhood recollections.</p>

<p>That is why I was excited to get a note from Barb, telling me that one of her stories had been accepted for David Suzuki&#8217;s website. If you have 15 minutes I suggest you get yourself a cup of coffee, sit back and enjoy <a href="http://www.davidsuzuki.org/issues/oceans/projects/healthy-oceans/pacific-ocean-stories/fishing-for-octopus/">the world that Barb creates with her story</a>. And perhaps I was wrong about this having nothing to do with photography. In the end we are both storytellers. Only Barb&#8217;s stories you can almost hear, feel, taste and touch. Let her transport you to a different time and a different world, to a time in her youth when she battled a giant octopus near Skookumchuk Rapids on the coast of British Columbia in 1943. When you&#8217;re done, please let me know what you think by commenting below.</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>It&#8217;s rarely that I come across a truly wonderful blog, one I cannot wait to share. But just yesterday my colleague Dan Stainer, an advanced amateur who could go pro whenever he wanted, sent me a link to his latest blog and I was impressed. Again.</p>

<p>In the way of background, Dan was honored by being selected for the Missouri Photography Workshop, where a group of skilled craftspeople share a week under the tutelage of some of the best photographers in the country. Each has to complete a photojournalism story while having their work critiqued at every twist and turn. Talking about pressure!</p>

<p><a href="http://blog.lesterpickerphoto.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/11/i-jX3HqBK-S.jpg"><img class="size-medium wp-image-2445" title="i-jX3HqBK-S" src="http://blog.lesterpickerphoto.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/11/i-jX3HqBK-S-300x200.jpg" alt="" width="300" height="200"></a></p>

<p>Dan did a credible job during his stay. But what I think makes his blog so good is its humanity. Dan shares with us his fears and self-doubt, the same ones we all face when we embark on a new assignment. I don&#8217;t want to give away too much. I urge you to <a href="http://danielstainer.wordpress.com/2012/11/03/missouri-photo-workshop-an-experience-that-lasts-a-lifetime/">visit his post</a> and enjoy it.</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>I frequently lecture about the importance of finding the &#8220;essence&#8221; in one&#8217;s images. By essence I mean the conscious effort to reduce the image to its defining characteristics, its purest storyline minus unnecessary distractions. It is a concept that invariably leads to a more focused image, to one that is more dramatic and appealing to the viewer.</p>

<p>One of the participants in my recent Acadia National Park (Maine) workshop for Nikonians sent me a good working example of the concept. We were shooting at the picturesque fishing village of Bass Harbor, when David Soderlund came across this scene. I&#8217;ll let him tell it in his own words:</p>

<p><a href="http://blog.lesterpickerphoto.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/11/DMS-critique-image-original.jpg"><img class="size-medium wp-image-2439" title="DMS critique image original" src="http://blog.lesterpickerphoto.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/11/DMS-critique-image-original-300x199.jpg" alt="" width="300" height="199"></a></p>

<p>&#8220;At the end of our time in Bass Harbor I grabbed a shot of the pier.  When I looked at it critically more recently, I realized that it was really the two boats, plus the lines of the pier, that caught my eye, but the rest of the image was pretty boring.&#8221;</p>

<p>Not satisfied with the image once he saw it on his screen, Dave took some drastic action.</p>

<p>&#8220;I cropped the image severely in Aperture 3 (throwing away a lot of pixels) to emphasize the &#8220;essence&#8221; of the image — for me, it was the two boats — and I selectively desaturated yellow hues slightly in Aperture to tone down the yellow lobster traps on the dock.  I applied filters in NIK Color Efex Pro 4 to increase contrast and enhance the surface detail in the boats.  The boats are clearly working boats rather than pleasure craft, and I wanted to emphasize that.</p>

<p>&#8221; I also used NIK Viveza 2 to selectively increase saturation of the blue tones in the foreground boat and desaturate the distracting bright red and pink of the cluster of buoys on the dock in the background.  Finally, I used NIK Sharpener Pro 3 to apply default sharpening for computer display before exporting the image.  I like the final result, but I wish I had seen this composition when I was shooting it!&#8221;</p>

<p><a href="http://blog.lesterpickerphoto.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/11/DMS-critique-image-final.jpg"><img class="size-medium wp-image-2440" title="CEP4 multiple filtersV2 selectve saturation/desaturation" src="http://blog.lesterpickerphoto.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/11/DMS-critique-image-final-300x189.jpg" alt="" width="300" height="189"></a></p>

<p> </p>

<p>No matter. The beauty of digital is that you can come home from a shoot and then work your images to suit your unique creative vision. I like what Dave has done here. He has reduced the image to its pure storyline- working fishing boats at a working fishing pier. By removing the distractions he found the essence of the image. Yes, he would have had more pixels to work with had he not had to crop so severely. But his post-processing hand was deftly applied, too. Now he has a print-worthy image to frame. Congrats, Dave!</p>

<p>In my next blog I&#8217;ll take a look at another approach to essence photography, namely <em>minimalism</em>, using a classic example from another of my workshop participants. Stay tuned!</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>Echoes of Earth</p>

<p>With the tail winds of Hurricane Sandy still buffeting our home last week, there was knock on the door and my mail carrier delivered a photography book that I had been looking forward to reviewing for my readers.</p>

<p>With a blanket wrapped around me for warmth, I settled down for a pleasant tour of some of the oldest rocks on our planet, which is the raison d&#8217;etre of writer-photographer L. Sue Baugh and her traveling companion, Lynn Martinelli. Over a period of ten years these two amazing women logged in 54,000 miles to visit and photograph these rock formations. The result is <em>Echoes of Earth</em> published by <a href="http://www.wildstonearts.com">Wild Stone arts</a> . Their incredible journey taught them some fascinating lessons about life itself.</p>

<p><a href="http://blog.lesterpickerphoto.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/11/eoe_coverb.jpg"><img class="alignnone size-medium wp-image-2436" title="eoe_coverb" src="http://blog.lesterpickerphoto.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/11/eoe_coverb-240x300.jpg" alt="" width="240" height="300"></a></p>

<p>The narrative is compelling, although at times too New Wave for my scientific training. For example, in a section on lichens, the author states: &#8220;As we move closer to each one, there&#8217;s a strange feeling of recognition, as if in some child-like way we know each other. Maybe the spirits are trying once again to give us knowledge.&#8221; Maybe. Yet one has to respect the awe these women experience when wandering these ancient rocky outcroppings.</p>

<p>In the chapter entitled &#8216;Strength Within our Bones,&#8217; the author explains how a fundamental mineral, apatite, formed some 4.5 billion years ago is critical to the strength and rigidity of our bones. Baugh extends that information into the chapter titled &#8216;Ancient Life Within Us,&#8217; which shows how the ancient minerals- all derivative of rocks- form the basis of our biology.</p>

<p>Yet, to be candid, the most surprising element of the book was the photography. Billed as having &#8220;breath-taking photographs,&#8221; I was sorely disappointed. Now I do not expect every coffee-table book to have stunning photography, but in a tome that boasts &#8220;over 200 spectacular photographs from three contents,&#8221; I expected far better images.</p>

<p>First, the images suffer from amateurish composition that make most of them dull and uninteresting. Second, the authors obviously confined their photography to mid-day hours almost exclusively, missing out on the lighting of &#8220;magic hours&#8221; which might have added some mood and drama. Third, most of the images are out of focus and far too many suffer from serious grain (all the photography was recorded on film). Finally, many of the images were overly enlarged, making them appear soft.</p>

<p>The publishers tried to add a few gimmicks, such as fold-out pages, fold-up pages, and circles and ovals cutouts. Unfortunately, due to the poor photography I do not feel they work.</p>

<p>One final point. It is not clear what role the second woman, Lynn Martinelli, has in the book&#8217;s production, other than accompanying Baugh. Did she write any of the text? Did she contribute to the photography? In the &#8220;About Us&#8221; section of <a href="http://www.wildstonearts.com">their website</a>, both women are profiled, yet the book only has Baugh&#8217;s name on the cover. In the FAQ section the text refers to &#8220;our photography.&#8221; As a reviewer I&#8217;m confused.</p>

<p>I wish I could have been floored by this book. But, for $40 I think photography readers would expect more.</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>Thought you might be interested in the newest addition to my workflow.</p>

<p><a href="http://blog.lesterpickerphoto.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/11/photo.jpg"><img class="alignnone size-medium wp-image-2432" title="photo" src="http://blog.lesterpickerphoto.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/11/photo-300x225.jpg" alt="" width="300" height="225"></a></p>

<p> </p>

<p>After 18 months of treatment for what we thought was simply plantar fasciitis turned out to actually be a fractured heel. It&#8217;s hard to be sure when it originally happened, but I&#8217;m certain it was hiking down some mountain path with 30 pounds of gear in my pack. As of today I am officially immobilized and in 6 weeks I look forward to hitting the trails again. In the meantime this baby cost me a trip to Africa. Damn!</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>If you have been following my blog the past few days, you know I live at the water&#8217;s due and that we&#8217;ve been hunkered down for Sandy. We prepped for days, removing everything from our garage floor, stuffing towels in our sliding doors to soak up wind-driven rain and  even evacuating for a night when flooding threatened. Fortunately, we came through the storm with minimal damage and no flooding at all. But, as several of you have pointed out, that&#8217;s what it costs to live here.</p>

<p>And then this morning we awoke to a cloudy day, but no rain, and with low-lyig clouds clearly matching the bands of wind we saw on our weather radar screen. The geese sauntered back into our cove, people were out cleaning up from the storm damage, and by mid-afternoon we were treated to something special.</p>

<p><a href="http://blog.lesterpickerphoto.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/10/fox-on-rock.jpg"><img class="size-medium wp-image-2428" title="fox-on-rock" src="http://blog.lesterpickerphoto.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/10/fox-on-rock-300x200.jpg" alt="" width="300" height="200"></a></p>

<p> </p>

<p>Not 100 yards from my deck a red fox was asleep on a slab of cement (from a previous storm), obviously enjoying the break in the weather. We&#8217;ve seen this beauty on and off over the past few years. I figure his den was washed out and he relished his lustrous coat drying out. He slept for about 30 minutes and then awoke with a start and was gone.</p>

<p>It was a lesson of sorts. True, every so often we get inconvenienced by storms, but most of the time there are the glorious blessings. The cycle of the seasons, birds migrating to and from, beaver searching for their winter supply of leafy treats, carp rooting in the muddy bottom to lay their eggs, even people frolicking on the water. We get wet, we dry out, on with life. My thanks to my red furry friend.</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>A great expression and one that sailors and those of us who live on the narrow margin of sea and land know well.</p>

<p>We returned to our home this morning and happily found that we were not flooded&#8230; yet. Roof tiles lay scattered on the ground, but the garage level was dry. And the house, which sits on pilings, is intact. Sighs of relief.</p>

<p>But it is now morning high tide as I write this. The back side of Hurricane Sandy is now churning the waters up our normally tranquil Chesapeake Bay, adding greatly to the tide&#8217;s height. The waters are lapping at the garage, but so far have not encroached. The biggest danger comes with tonight&#8217;s high tide. So we wait and keep watch.</p>

<p>This is a view directly across our tiny cove at two docks, or what used to be docks. Hard to say how they fared since they are both underwater. Time and tide will tell us at dawn tomorrow.</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>As of 4:00 PM today we had to evacuate our home, one of the perils of living on the water&#8217;s edge. As it turns out our tiny, historic town of Havre de Grace, Maryland is directly in line of the worst of the storm (as of 6:30PM according to the New York Times). The winds here are already ferocious and are predicted to double as the center of the storm passes during the night.</p>

<p>My main concern at the moment is high tide, when the waters of the mighty, wind-whipped Susquehanna River meet the incoming tide running up the Chesapeake Bay. Unfortunately this time- but fortunately the other 99.99% of the time- we live at the confluence of both bodies of water. We expect to be flooded. Our hope is that it stays below 24&#8221; in our garage.</p>

<p>This is an iPhone image taken from my deck a couple of hours before we left and it doesn&#8217;t look too terribly bad.</p>

<p><a href="http://blog.lesterpickerphoto.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/10/storm.jpg"><img class="alignnone size-medium wp-image-2419" title="storm" src="http://blog.lesterpickerphoto.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/10/storm-300x225.jpg" alt="" width="300" height="225"></a></p>

<p>By now we envision roof tiles ripped off and the waters rising. Oh, well.</p>

<p>I&#8217;ll get some images when we return, hopefully to a nice, dry home! Stay posted.</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>I&#8217;m here at PhotoPlus 2012 with Bob Boyer, my assistant, and so far we&#8217;re enjoying the immersion in all things photographic. The Javits Center in mid-town Manhattan is gigantic and it is currently filled with tens of thousands of photo enthusiasts from all over the country, weaving their way through the overwhelming maze of exhibitors.</p>

<p>Today I spent most of my time talking with people who visited the Intelicoat Technologies, Inc. booth. I was one of the guest artists for their Museo Fine Art papers exhibit on the main floor of the gargantuan exhibition hall.</p>

<p> </p>

<p>As I&#8217;ve said before, my assistant and Master Printer Bob Boyer and I simply love the luscious Museo papers. They have become the mainstay of our Limited Edition collections. We depend on their consistency, incredible D-MAX performance and tonal range to produce our large and small format prints.</p>

<p>Tomorrow I&#8217;ll share with you some of the neat photo gadgets, gizmos and geeky gifts I saw at PhotoPlus. Please visit my blog then and you&#8217;ll be set for Christmas and Hanukkah.</p>

<p> </p>

<p>P)LEASE NOTE: Sorry folks, but I arrived home to preparations for Hurricane Sandy. We live on the Chesapeake Bay in Maryland and we may have to evacuate, so stay tuned for details on PhotoPlus (and how we weathered the hurricane).</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>Bob and I are off to the <a href="http://www.photoplusexpo.com">PhotoPlus</a> Expo in New York City. PhotoPlus is the largest photo convention in the country, drawing tens of thousands of avid photographers. The convention hall is filled with amateurs and pros checking out the hundreds of exhibitors and brushing up on new products and techniques.</p>

<p><a href="http://blog.lesterpickerphoto.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/10/display.php_.jpeg"><img class="alignnone size-medium wp-image-2404" title="display.php" src="http://blog.lesterpickerphoto.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/10/display.php_-300x115.jpeg" alt="" width="300" height="115"></a></p>

<p>There are demonstrations, lectures, one-on-one consultations and critiques. The atmosphere is fairly electric. Even if you spent every moment of the three days exploring the vendors, you&#8217;d be hard pressed to cover them all. Cameras, lenses, printers, gadget bags, lighting products, and photo papers.</p>

<p>The latter is what is drawing us this year. Partnering with <a href="http://www.museofineart.com">Museo Digital Fine Art Media</a>, a division of Intelicoat Technologies, our photographic artwork is being featured in their exhibit. Bob is the Master Printer who brings my landscapes, wildlife and custom photography to life. We printed a series of my images on Museo&#8217;s Silver Rag and Max paper for their New York exhibit. During the Expo I&#8217;ll be photographing with my iPhone and posting updates on new equipment, techniques, and interesting people.</p>

<p> </p>

<p><a href="http://blog.lesterpickerphoto.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/10/fc44ffba685c2f00b6ab547fa5d201f4.png"><img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-2405" title="fc44ffba685c2f00b6ab547fa5d201f4" src="http://blog.lesterpickerphoto.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/10/fc44ffba685c2f00b6ab547fa5d201f4.png" alt="" width="200" height="47"></a></p>

<p>The interesting thing about our association with Museo is that we have always loved their papers. They are luscious, gorgeous, consistent- whatever adjective you&#8217;d want to associate with the best fine art photo papers. And their D-Max is unbeatable. If you are planning to attend PhotoPlus, please stop by Museo&#8217;s booth to learn about their products and say hi.</p>
