  <div class="entry-content"><p>I just posted selected  images on  my website from my recent trip to New Zealand. They join the images I recently posted from Australia. Please head over to my image website by clicking on the &#8220;Lester Picker Photography&#8221; black box at the top right of this page (or top left).</p>

<p><a href="http://blog.lesterpickerphoto.com/wp-content/uploads/2010/12/Milford-Sound-South-Island-New-Zealand-442010-11-151.jpg"><img class="size-medium wp-image-833" title="Milford Sound, South Island, New Zealand 442010-11-15" src="http://blog.lesterpickerphoto.com/wp-content/uploads/2010/12/Milford-Sound-South-Island-New-Zealand-442010-11-151-300x199.jpg" alt="" width="300" height="199"></a></p>

<p>You&#8217;ll notice that I rendered many of the new images in B&amp;W. I love B&amp;W photography, but my hand was forced in this case by the horrible weather we encountered. It either rained or the skies were gray much of the time. While that is disappointing on the color side, it is a gift for B&amp;W enthusiasts.</p>

<p>I hope you enjoy the images. As always I welcome your comments and critique.</p>

<p>For the entire month of January, all Australia and New Zealand images are on sale at 25% off. Simply add the code &#8220;January Sale&#8221; into the appropriate box when you check out and the discount will be automatically applied. We use ultra-secure PayPal payment services and we normally ship within 48 hours. However, each image is custom printed and must have adequate drying time, so please be patient.</p>

<p>I&#8217;ll soon be posting selected images from Fiji and New Caledonia. Stay tuned!</p>

<p>Thank you for your support and purchases in 2010.</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>Having spent four of the grayest, rainiest weeks ever in Australia, Fiji, New Caledonia and New Zealand, it reminded me of a valuable pro photographic lesson that I’ll share with you. It’s called ‘extraction.’</p>

<p>Of course, every photographer loves sunny days with lots of blue sky and clouds. But, what do you do when you get to a place where you only have a day or two and the weather sucks? Maybe it’s actively raining (that’s the subject of a future blog) or, worse yet, the sky is a featureless, dull gray, the proverbial kiss of death for photographers. Even dark, angry clouds are great for dramatic impact, so no complaints from this photographer when the weather threatens. But those dull, lifeless skies are the nemesis of the hardworking pro.</p>

<h3>Extraction Shots</h3>


<p>So, what we do in that case is extract images from the background and simply exclude that dull sky, the equivalent of making lemonade from lemons. In fact, plant and flower images often are best under gray skies, since the lighting is even and you don’t get harsh shadows or hotspots on the bright areas of flowers.</p>

<p>If you have a flower or tree with great colors- especially after a rain when raindrops are still visible on the petals- you can work with the scene and get acceptable images. In this shot, we were in the mountains of Doubtful Sound, on the South Island of New Zealand. It was a drizzly, gray day so I couldn&#8217;t shoot the mountain against the sky. Instead I shot this Mt. Cook lily. I wouldn’t call this a prize-winner, but I think it’s a solid image. Not sure what I’ll do with it, though.</p>

<p><a href="http://blog.lesterpickerphoto.com/wp-content/uploads/2010/12/Mt.-Cook-Lilly-Doubtful-Sound-New-Zealand-32010-11-17.jpg"><img class="size-medium wp-image-825" title="Mt. Cook Lilly, Doubtful Sound, New Zealand 32010-11-17" src="http://blog.lesterpickerphoto.com/wp-content/uploads/2010/12/Mt.-Cook-Lilly-Doubtful-Sound-New-Zealand-32010-11-17-200x300.jpg" alt="" width="200" height="300"></a></p>

<h3>Extracting Urban Scenes</h3>


<p>Ditto with urban scenes on yucky days, where you need to discipline yourself to take tight shots that give you a sense of place without including the sky. I had only two days in Christchurch, New Zealand and again the weather was terrible. I knew I couldn’t get the images I had planned, such as the cathedral against a blue sky with clouds. Nor could I get some of the Botanical Garden images I had planned. So, I changed my focus to extract shots of subject against a contextual background without including the sky. These two images give you an idea of what I’m talking about, both taken in Christchurch, at the cathedral of the same name.</p>

<p><a href="http://blog.lesterpickerphoto.com/wp-content/uploads/2010/12/Christchurch-South-Island-New-Zealand-502010-11-20.jpg"><img class="size-medium wp-image-826" title="Christchurch, South Island, New Zealand 502010-11-20" src="http://blog.lesterpickerphoto.com/wp-content/uploads/2010/12/Christchurch-South-Island-New-Zealand-502010-11-20-200x300.jpg" alt="" width="200" height="300"></a></p>

<p>(For those of you interested in the technical aspects, I rendered the next image in Black and White, but left the umbrella and the man&#8217;s shirt in color).</p>

<p><a href="http://blog.lesterpickerphoto.com/wp-content/uploads/2010/12/Christchurch-South-Island-New-Zealand-782010-11-20.jpg"><img class="size-medium wp-image-827" title="Christchurch, South Island, New Zealand 782010-11-20" src="http://blog.lesterpickerphoto.com/wp-content/uploads/2010/12/Christchurch-South-Island-New-Zealand-782010-11-20-199x300.jpg" alt="" width="199" height="300"></a></p>

<h3>Forest Extraction Images</h3>


<p>One final example. You can also isolate elements of a forest by using a telephoto and focusing on a specific tree or branch that has great color or an unusual shape. In this next image I was on a boat in Milford Sound, South Island, New Zealand on another miserable day. I would have loved to have landed on a solid shoreline to photograph the scene with my tripod so it would be tack sharp and I could include the foggy, misty sky, but that wasn’t possible. So I went with the flow (and rocking of the boat) and upped the ISO to 800 to extract trees from the background. I liked this shot for the compositional elements of the way the tree filled the frame and seems to flow through it, but it wasn’t tack sharp, usually a fatal flaw that forces me to press the Delete key. However, in this case I decided to have fun with it and I processed the image with a soft glow filter using Nik Software, something I rarely do, but I’m not apologizing for it. For me it works although, as always, I welcome your reaction and critique, which you can leave as a comment at the end of this blog.</p>

<p><a href="http://blog.lesterpickerphoto.com/wp-content/uploads/2010/12/Doubtful-Sound-New-Zealand-592010-11-17.jpg"><img class="size-medium wp-image-828" title="Doubtful Sound, New Zealand 592010-11-17" src="http://blog.lesterpickerphoto.com/wp-content/uploads/2010/12/Doubtful-Sound-New-Zealand-592010-11-17-199x300.jpg" alt="" width="199" height="300"></a></p>

<p>Until the next blog, don’t get driven to distraction by featureless skies. Take control and drive yourself to extraction.</p>

<p>Happy shooting!</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>As a veteran photographer who has witnessed the digital revolution that effectively beheaded film photography, I can say that I’ve seen a lot in my day. And now that digital is here, the evolution has accelerated so that one can hardly keep pace with the innovations. Cameras that cost $5,000 when launched are replaced by cousins that are faster, more sensitive and have more features, at half the price.</p>

<p>Even my tiny iPod offers an HDR (High Dynamic Range) app. Admittedly, I have one of them- Pro HDR- on my device. Unbelievably, it does a very nice job… for a $1.99 phone app. So I was naturally intrigued by an article in today’s New York Times, which explores the future world of photography, from the perspective of some top academic research labs in America.</p>

<h3>Here It Comes!</h3>


<p>Are you ready for cameras that can realio, trulio take a picture around a corner and into a darkened room? Well, believe it, because researchers at M.I.T. are using lasers mounted inside a camera to fire pulses at one-trillionth of a second. The laser light bounces off walls and doors to illuminate what’s in another room. Creepy! It’s a ways off before we’ll see it in the marketplace, thank heavens.</p>

<p><a href="http://blog.lesterpickerphoto.com/wp-content/uploads/2010/12/images.jpeg"><img class="size-full wp-image-819" title="images" src="http://blog.lesterpickerphoto.com/wp-content/uploads/2010/12/images.jpeg" alt="" width="99" height="127"></a></p>

<p>I can’t imagine that innovation would be useful for my photography, but the CIA is probably foaming at the mouth waiting for it. However, another app that researchers are working on would be ideal for landscape photographers. It mathematically calculates the exact spot from which a photo was taken so you can re-shoot the scene precisely. That bests even GPS technology, which can get us to a scene, but not help us place the camera exactly. I can imagine using it to follow a scene through the seasons, for example, or perhaps to record environmental changes over time.</p>

<h3>Closed Code Stifles Innovation</h3>


<p>Apparently, one of the big issues in this burgeoning field is that cameras, unlike computers, are closed source. In other words, programmers can’t fiddle with the middle and add code that will allow them to experiment with new techniques. However, some forward-thinking companies are jumping on the bandwagon and giving the researchers access to the top-secret computer chips and code.</p>

<p>To see the NY Times article, go to: <a href="http://www.nytimes.com/2010/12/19/business/19novel.html?_r=1&amp;hpw">http://www.nytimes.com/2010/12/19/business/19novel.html?_r=1&amp;hpw</a></p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>I was contributing to a forum yesterday when the question came up about tripods. Specifically, the writer wanted to know whether to bring an additional lens along when he hikes the Grand Canyon or leave it home so he could bring along his tripod. Further, if he were to bring a tripod, he was seeking input on which lightweight one to get.</p>

<p>Two experienced photographers suggested the man bring a tripod and even offered suggestions on which lightweight model to buy. My slant on tripod use is slightly different and I’d like to share it with you here.</p>

<p>To my way of thinking there is no real point in squeezing in another lens, no matter how sharp and wonderful it is, if you don’t have a stable platform on which to place it. When shooting landscapes or wildlife, and you are looking for magazine-quality images, you simply have to use a tripod to frame the scene properly and eliminate camera shake. You may not think so, but adding a tripod can make the difference between a perfect image and a so-so one.</p>

<p>With the kind of shooting that I primarily do, namely landscapes, I want extreme depth of field. I may also use a filter or two. That translates to less light getting to the sensor and correspondingly longer exposure times, which in turn does not lend itself to hand-held shooting.</p>

<p>Look, I am a 55+ photographer and I lug a 30-pound backpack on mountain hikes. I also have a bad back (probably from carrying a 30-pound backpack!). But I’d never leave my big tripod (Gitzo 3541 and RRS BH-55 ball head) home. I’d rather leave behind a lens or two, and guarantee that I’ll have tack-sharp images, suitable for my editors. Of course, I’m assuming that the tripod is paired with a cable or electronic release.</p>

<p><a href="http://blog.lesterpickerphoto.com/wp-content/uploads/2010/12/TVC33.png"><img class="size-medium wp-image-814" title="TVC33" src="http://blog.lesterpickerphoto.com/wp-content/uploads/2010/12/TVC33-228x300.png" alt="" width="228" height="300"></a></p>

<p>Moving one step further, I choose to shlep a regular (carbon-fiber) tripod with me rather than a lightweight model for the simple reason that a tripod’s effectiveness as a stable platform is directly proportional to its total mass. I suppose that someone could argue that point with me until s/he is blue in the face, but that still wouldn’t change the laws of physics. One way to try to minimize that problem is to hang a weight (like your backpack, for example) from the center column, which adds mass and subsequently reduces vibrations, but that would, of course, work even better with a heavier tripod, right?</p>

<p>So, there you have it. My take on tripods.</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>Folks, I&#8217;ve been saying it for years and now it&#8217;s official:</p>

<p><strong>AIR CANADA VOTED TOP HONOURS BY READERS OF BUSINESS TRAVELER MAGAZINE</strong></p>

<div id="content">
<ul>
<li><strong>Best Flight Attendants in North America</strong></li>
    <li><strong>Best In-Flight Services in North America</strong></li>
    <li><strong>Best North American Airline for Business Class Service</strong></li>
    <li><strong>Best North American Airline for International Travel </strong></li>
    <li>
<strong>Best Airline Web Sit</strong><strong>e</strong>
</li>
</ul>
I&#8217;m not professing to know about business travel, since I fly cattle-car within North American destinations. But I have been saying in my blogs that even in Economy, it&#8217;s hard to beat Air Canada.

<a href="http://blog.lesterpickerphoto.com/wp-content/uploads/2010/12/Air-Canada-seat.jpg"><img class="size-medium wp-image-798" title="Air Canada seat" src="http://blog.lesterpickerphoto.com/wp-content/uploads/2010/12/Air-Canada-seat-300x240.jpg" alt="" width="300" height="240"></a>

<div class="mceTemp mceIEcenter"><dl id="attachment_798" class="wp-caption aligncenter" style="width: 310px;"><dd class="wp-caption-dd">Air Canada seat-back unit (file photo)</dd></dl></div>


<p>One of my favorite features is that there is a 120-volt outlet at every seat, as well as a USB port and terrific touch-screen entertainment system. Plug in, stick in your earbuds, turn on the music (or movie)  and you can either relax or get substantial work done with no hassles. They also really, truly have flight attendants who are attendant!</p>

<p>Anyway, congrats Air Canada on a recognition that is well deserved.</p>

<p>Ten trips does not make me a cruise expert, especially since I regularly meet people with 30, 50 and more cruises under their belts (and we’ll get to what else is under those belts in a moment). But I do figure that my cruise experiences, coupled with the fact that I am a seasoned travel photojournalist, gives me some credibility to make some observations and recommendations (I’d also love to read your observations, and so will my readers, if you’ll kindly comment here on this blog).</p>

<p>First, I fought the cruise experience for decades, erroneously thinking that it was:</p>

<p>a. for older and/or more sedentary folks</p>

<p>b. too confining</p>

<p>c. for people with B-I-G appetites</p>

<p>d. all of the above</p>

<p>But, after much cajoling from my wife I finally succumbed and have been really enjoying them over the past five years.</p>

<p><a href="http://blog.lesterpickerphoto.com/wp-content/uploads/2010/12/Rhapsody-of-the-Seas-Royal-Caribbean-482010-11-07.jpg"><img class="aligncenter size-medium wp-image-786" title="Rhapsody of the Seas-Royal Caribbean 482010-11-07" src="http://blog.lesterpickerphoto.com/wp-content/uploads/2010/12/Rhapsody-of-the-Seas-Royal-Caribbean-482010-11-07-199x300.jpg" alt="" width="199" height="300"></a></p>

<h3>Cruise Ship Observations</h3>


<p>So, here goes with my observations. First, my hat is off to those younger couples that cruise with children. For those of you who have never cruised before, the cabins are efficiently laid out, but laughably small and I simply can’t imagine the challenges presented to families with little ones sharing the same cabin. Judging by the body language and dark circles under the eyes of those very same parents after about day three, cruising with young kids may not exactly make you a winner on “Are You Smarter Than a Fifth Grader?”</p>

<p>Next is an observation my wife and I made when we once went on two cruises back-to-back. Since we were cruising for two weeks straight, we did an informal survey and here’s what we found: seventy percent of the kids at the dining tables either played video games during dinner or had earphones in or on their ears (many also wore a baseball hat, with the brim turned backward). Have our cultural norms really changed that much? Why do parents allow such behavior? Do I sound like an old fart??</p>

<p>Okay, enough about kids and families. Longer cruises- those over 10 days- tend to draw an older crowd due to the expense involved and the time required. Our recent 12-day cruise from Sydney, Australia to Fiji and New Caledonia included many retirees. As a result, the trip was pleasantly quiet, as opposed to two shorter cruises we have taken from New York City, where it was a far younger, partying and drinking crowd. Keep that in mind when booking your cruise.</p>

<p><a href="http://blog.lesterpickerphoto.com/wp-content/uploads/2010/12/Rhapsody-of-the-Seas-Royal-Caribbean-782010-11-07.jpg"><img class="size-medium wp-image-787" title="Rhapsody of the Seas-Royal Caribbean 782010-11-07" src="http://blog.lesterpickerphoto.com/wp-content/uploads/2010/12/Rhapsody-of-the-Seas-Royal-Caribbean-782010-11-07-300x199.jpg" alt="" width="300" height="199"></a></p>

<h3>Eat Your Heart Out</h3>


<p>If you think that cruising is nothing but one big, fat eat-fest, you’re… well, actually you’re right. It’s the glutton’s version of The Grand Canyon. Let’s call it The Great Gorge. There are so many eating options, essentially 24/7, one could easily gain 10 pounds on a 7-day cruise. And it’s amazing to see how many serious over-eaters frequent these ships, from basic overweight-and-out-of-shape through obese to morbidly obese. There are the basic three squares a day that the dining service offers, which can be taken in a huge, gloriously extravagant dining room, served by a formal wait staff, or in a pile-it-higher-and-deeper smorgasbord buffet arrangement. In either case you can ask for, or get up and get, your own seconds, thirds or more. Of course, every meal includes multiple dessert options.</p>

<p><a href="http://blog.lesterpickerphoto.com/wp-content/uploads/2010/12/Rhapsody-of-the-Seas-Royal-Caribbean-572010-11-07.jpg"><img class="size-medium wp-image-788" title="Rhapsody of the Seas-Royal Caribbean 572010-11-07" src="http://blog.lesterpickerphoto.com/wp-content/uploads/2010/12/Rhapsody-of-the-Seas-Royal-Caribbean-572010-11-07-300x199.jpg" alt="" width="300" height="199"></a></p>

<p>Then there are the multitude of little cafes aboard ship, where one can indulge without incurring extra fees, as well as specialty cafes, like Ben and Jerry’s ice cream shops, for example, where you pay extra. And again, there are the free midnight buffets or “Chocolate Extravaganzas,” where even sniffing the decadent desserts concocted by the pastry chefs can cost you boku calories.</p>

<p><a href="http://blog.lesterpickerphoto.com/wp-content/uploads/2010/12/Rhapsody-of-the-Seas-Royal-Caribbean-282010-11-07.jpg"><img class="size-medium wp-image-789" title="Rhapsody of the Seas-Royal Caribbean 282010-11-07" src="http://blog.lesterpickerphoto.com/wp-content/uploads/2010/12/Rhapsody-of-the-Seas-Royal-Caribbean-282010-11-07-300x199.jpg" alt="" width="300" height="199"></a></p>

<p>On our latest cruise, for example, the ship’s kitchen staff served 120,000 meals to 2,000 people and went through 48,000 eggs. I watched grown people pile four and five desserts on their plates, like Mom wasn’t watching. Of course most passengers exhibit restraint… many do… at least some do… but it is tempting, no doubt.</p>

<h3>Bingo!?</h3>


<p>Another observation- and here I’m just curious… really!- but wouldn’t you think there were better things to do on a cruise than play Bingo for hours at a time? Yet that’s a big draw aboard ship (and big money-maker for the cruise lines). People typically wait in long lines to buy their cards, and then crowd into a lounge to play. I’ve got nothing against Bingo, but onboard ship? I suppose it’s just a way that many people let down their hair and have fun. Please enlighten me here if I’m missing some larger picture. Seriously.</p>

<p>So, what tips and recommendations can I make to those of you contemplating your first cruise (or even seasoned travelers wanting to try something different)?</p>

<h3>Learn Something New</h3>


<p>First, why not attend some of the informational presentations by the lecturers hired by the cruise ship companies? Their presentations vary, of course, from downright boring to exciting (of course mine fall into the latter category). But I can’t help but think that giving up a Bingo game or the Biggest Stomach contest (for real!) for a chance at learning something new is worth it.</p>

<p><a href="http://blog.lesterpickerphoto.com/wp-content/uploads/2010/12/cruise-lecture_2010-10-28_667%C2%A9LesterPicker.jpg"><img class="size-medium wp-image-793" title="cruise lecture_2010-10-28_667©LesterPicker" src="http://blog.lesterpickerphoto.com/wp-content/uploads/2010/12/cruise-lecture_2010-10-28_667%C2%A9LesterPicker-300x225.jpg" alt="" width="300" height="225"></a></p>

<p>Cruise ships are also great places to learn to dance or to try a new craft, all of which are offered onboard. Want to learn how to fold towels into animal shapes? They actually offer lessons on most cruise ships. So far I’ve managed to resist that one, but it might be cool for a family with young children.</p>

<h3>Treat Yourself</h3>


<p>Cruise ships also have some excellent exercise and spa facilities. The gym is free, but there are also specialty programs that allow the cruise line to earn extra bucks. The spa is also extra, but the prices are not unreasonable. Massages, for example, are competitively priced with any day spa.</p>

<p>I’ve got to say that it’s always an extra kick for me to work out while at sea. The gyms on every ship I’ve sailed on have wraparound windows, so the views are priceless. I once saw some whales cavorting as I climbed Mt. Everest on the treadmill (well, that’s what it felt like!).</p>

<h3>Make Friends</h3>


<p>Cruising is a great way to make friends. On every cruise we’ve been on, there are passengers who eat only at the buffet or in the dining room at a table for two, for the entire trip. Why not try sitting at a table for eight and meet some fascinating people? If you don’t get along with your companions, simply ask the maitre de to transfer tables. My wife and I have made some wonderful friends that way (here’s a shout-out to Mario, Glennis, Bill and Lisa, our amazing Aussie table companions!).</p>

<h3>Get Out!</h3>


<p>Believe it or not, many passengers choose to stay onboard when the ship stops in port, perhaps for financial or health reasons, which I certainly can understand. But the sheer number of people who remain onboard couldn’t possibly all be in bad health or financially destitute, unless they played too much Bingo or logged in too many pulls on the slot handle.</p>

<p>Ports of call present a terrific opportunity to see new sites, expose oneself to different people and cultures, tease your taste buds with exotic spices, or just find a remote beach where you can relax. I heartily recommend either booking on the ship tours or hiring a taxi for the day (make sure you get back at least an hour before the ship is set to sail).</p>

<h3>Get in!</h3>


<p>Take advantage of the many shows and performances offered on every cruise ship. I am almost always impressed by the amount of talent shown by the performers, some of whom go on to careers on Broadway and other competitive venues.</p>

<p>The onboard shows have only improved in recent years, as competition for passengers has intensified. There are musicals, Broadway-type mini-shows, dancers, magicians, acrobats, singers, orchestras. On our last cruise we watched, spellbound, as an eastern European couple danced a modern ballet routine accompanied by music and a video that was evocative and highly emotional. The combination of fluid movement and incredible strength was mesmerizing. I’m not saying that every show is world-class, but enough are to warrant getting to the theater early.</p>

<h3>Get Real!</h3>


<p>If you are still a working stiff, there may be times during your cruise when you simply have to get some work done. Or maybe not. Maybe you just want to read quietly. I’ll admit I’m one of those who logs in some work time while under sail and I have to say that the view from the office can’t be beat.</p>

<p><a href="http://blog.lesterpickerphoto.com/wp-content/uploads/2010/12/Rhapsody-of-the-Seas-Royal-Caribbean-192010-11-07.jpg"><img class="size-medium wp-image-790" title="Rhapsody of the Seas-Royal Caribbean 192010-11-07" src="http://blog.lesterpickerphoto.com/wp-content/uploads/2010/12/Rhapsody-of-the-Seas-Royal-Caribbean-192010-11-07-300x199.jpg" alt="" width="300" height="199"></a></p>

<p>Imagine reading on deck, with a cool (or warm) breeze gently blowing as you sail past tropical islands. Or imagine finding a shady spot on deck to open your laptop and send some emails to family or colleagues.</p>

<p>Every ship has a library, too, so on bad weather days it’s a great retreat. Quiet lounges are also good for getting some work done. My intention is not to encourage you workaholics out there, but simply to point out that one can get some serious work done if needed.</p>

<p>In any event, I have found the cruise experience to be far different than my pre-cruising biased assumptions. In fact, I find cruises fun, relaxing and rejuvenating. Oh, and did I mention the food?</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>As I mentioned in a previous blog (<a href="http://blog.lesterpickerphoto.com/2010/11/28/te-anau-new-zealand/">http://blog.lesterpickerphoto.com/2010/11/28/te-anau-new-zealand/</a>), Te Anau is a wonderful small town situated on the shores of Lake Te Anau. It is blessed to sit on the eastern side of the mountain chain that affords it protection from the winds and storms that blow in from the Tasmanian Sea.</p>

<p><a href="http://blog.lesterpickerphoto.com/wp-content/uploads/2010/12/Lake-Te-Anau-South-Island-New-Zealand-282010-11-16.jpg"><img class="size-medium wp-image-775" title="Lake Te Anau, South Island, New Zealand 282010-11-16" src="http://blog.lesterpickerphoto.com/wp-content/uploads/2010/12/Lake-Te-Anau-South-Island-New-Zealand-282010-11-16-300x199.jpg" alt="" width="300" height="199"></a></p>

<p>It’s hard for me to absorb the following statistics: rainfall in the foothills on the southeast side of Lake  Manapouri, just east of the mountain range averages about 1 meter (39 inches) a year. That’s a reasonable amount of rain, comparable to the 40 inches of rain that falls in my home state of Maryland. But on the northwest shore of Lake Manapouri, where our boat just dropped us off, rainfall averages three meters a year (117 inches)!</p>

<h3>A Beautiful Sound</h3>


<p>Now our rickety bus is taking us along a narrow, winding gravel road that climbs those mountains- the only road available- and after 30 minutes our small group find itself on the shores of Doubtful Sound, so named by Captain Cook in 1770 because of its forbidding navigation. Without exaggeration, it is one of the most spectacular places I have ever been, with its deep fiords and towering peaks. It looks every bit like the rain forest that it is, but it takes an average of seven to nine meters of rain a year to maintain that botanical diversity! That’s meters, as in 39 inches to a meter, or 275-350 inches of rain falling on average for 225 days a year. That is a whole lot of rain! And, man, are we in the midst of it!</p>

<p><a href="http://blog.lesterpickerphoto.com/wp-content/uploads/2010/12/Milford-Sound-South-Island-New-Zealand-442010-11-15.jpg"><img class="size-medium wp-image-776" title="Milford Sound, South Island, New Zealand 442010-11-15" src="http://blog.lesterpickerphoto.com/wp-content/uploads/2010/12/Milford-Sound-South-Island-New-Zealand-442010-11-15-300x199.jpg" alt="" width="300" height="199"></a></p>

<p>Te Anau is the launching point for trips to nearby Milford and Doubtful Sounds. These trips can be one-day affairs or multi-day excursions. The Doubtful Sound excursion involves taking a bus from Te Anau to Manapouri, then a 45-minute boat ride across the lake and then another bus up and over the mountains, before dropping steeply to Doubtful Sound and the boat you will call home for a few hours, or possibly two or more days. Companies like Real Journeys (<a href="http://www.realjourneys.co.nz">www.realjourneys.co.nz</a>) and Fiordland Cruises (<a href="http://www.doubtfulsound.com">http://www.doubtfulsound.com</a>/) offer these not-to-be-missed packages (there are other outfitters, too). In Te Anau, Real Journeys is the heavyweight adventure outfitter, with a wider selection of activities and larger boats, while Fiordland and its cousins offer smaller boats and more intimate experiences.</p>

<p>I chose Real Journeys for two of my three Sound experiences; a one-day cruise on Milford Sound and a half-day trip to the Glowworm Caves.</p>

<p>Milford Sound receives the lion’s share of the attention when visitors consider cruising on a fiord. But, in my opinion, Doubtful Sound is far more spectacular, although less predictable weather-wise. On our two-day Doubtful Sound cruise, we enjoyed the area’s reputation for liquid sunshine to the tune of non-stop rain, day and night without letup. Still one cannot help but be awed by the natural splendor of these fiords.</p>

<p>Our one-day Milford Sound excursion was no different, with rain seriously curtailing my photography. It’s one thing to photograph in the rain, it’s another to do so on a moving, pitching and yawing small boat with the wind blowing. Frustrating, yes, but the purpose of the trip was more to scout out locations for our intended 3-month return visit in 2012-2013. This time I’ll plan to visit closer to summer. BTW, I’ll also be offering some exciting photography workshops at that time, so contact me to be placed on my list if you are interested.</p>

<h3>A Glowing Experience</h3>


<p>One of the highlights of our stay in Te Anau, was our half-day visit to the Glowworm caves on the north shore of Lake Te Anau. A 30-minute Real Journeys boat trip took us to a docking facility for the caves. We sat through a short video presentation and then were escorted as part of a small group into the cave itself.</p>

<p>Cave is a bit of a misnomer in this case. The Glowworm cave is part of a labyrinthine system of caves, some four miles long and cascading through four levels. Visitors may only access the Glowworm caves, located at the lower end of what is known as the Aurora Caves, and at another site on the upper end.</p>

<p>As a former biologist I was absolutely captivated by this cave and the way in which it has been packaged, with respect for the fragile environment. We entered as part of a 14-person group. The cave system is huge, with a raging river thundering through it. Catwalks allow visitors to walk through, every bend and turn more fascinating then the last. At one point you come to a waterfall roaring down a wall and into a pool.</p>

<h3>Glowworms: A Biological Phenomenon</h3>


<p>And then, you come to the glowworms. My biological curiosity was peaked by these amazing creatures that are actually the larval stage of a fly. They create long mucous tubes within which thy crawl so they are not desiccated. From these tubes they suspend sticky mucous strings with title droplets that look like jewels. They then turn on a tiny bioluminescent light located near its tail, which attracts insects that the larvae use as food. At one point in the cave all 14 people silently board a boat that is hand-pulled to the middle of a grotto. It is pitch dark and suddenly you look up and see a constellation of glowworm ‘stars’ that has everyone gasping.</p>

<p>Everyone, that is, except for the insensitive moron sitting behind me who whispered to his young son: “Hey, this is what they’re making such a big deal about?” I guess he was hoping for “It’s a Small World After All” and a fireworks display. Go figure.</p>

<p>Everyone, that is, except for the insensitive moron sitting behind me who whispered to his young son: “Hey, this is what they’re making such a big deal about?” I guess he was hoping for “It’s a Small World After All” and a fireworks display. Go figure.</p>
