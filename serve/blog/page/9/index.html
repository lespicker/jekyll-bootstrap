<p>I am constantly struck by the moments of pure grace that present themselves to us if we are fortunate enough to be tuned in at that moment. Such was the case with the following image. I was with a group of fellow photographers and we had been out since 4:30 AM photographing a mountainscape sunrise (see Rampart Pond Sunrise Limited Edition print) in the spectacular Canadian Rockies.</p>

<p>We were heading back to our lodge, tired and hungry, not having eaten for about eight hours. Yet the late fall sunset called to us and so we stopped. The clouds rolled in frustrating our attempts to capture what had been a compelling scene. Everyone trudged through the snow back to the van. All but me, that is. I saw a tiny crack developing in the clouds over the mountain. I reset my tripod, crouched down next to the pond and snapped this swatch of sunset. In an instant it was gone. Even as I packed up my gear I knew I had been anointed. Providence happens.</p>

<p>Contrary to the myth about professional photographers, I really do not carry my camera around me with everywhere. In this case I was eating dinner with my wife and our granddaughter at the fine restaurant at the Moraine Lake lodge. The solarium-like dining room allowed us to take in the grandeur of the lake. Throughout the meal the setting sun kept tantalizing me. To my credit, I withstood its siren-song through appetizers, salad and nearly all my entree.</p>

<p>Then I started seeing this image forming. My understanding wife and granddaughter blessed my taking off before dessert. I ran to my room, grabbed my gear and bolted for the rock summit overlooking this pristine lake.</p>

<p>Moraine Lake is truly my favorite in the Canadian Rockies. The eleven peaks that surround it add a spiritual dimension that one can only appreciate when the crowds are gone in Fall. And, yes, the lake is truly this color when the sun shines on its pristine surface.</p>

<hr />

<p>I love Alberta, Canada and its awe inspiring National Parks. Both Jasper and Banff National Parks, as well as Kananaskis, are eye candy for the landscape photographer (and not too shabby for wildlife photographers either). I try to get to Alberta at least once every two years, to immerse myself in its beauty.</p>

<p>On this fall day, it had drizzled most of the morning and into afternoon, but when I arrived at Hillsdale Meadow it had just stopped. The good news was that the rain kept the crowds to a bare minimum, allowing me time to saunter through the meadow, finding the compositions I wanted.</p>

<p>As typically happens, it wasn&#8217;t until I was ready to leave that I noticed the touch of alpenglow on the peak just above the trees. I grabbed my tripod and ran to a spot I had photographed earlier. Over the next fifteen minutes I shot several frames and then the clouds moved in and it began to rain once again. But when I looked at my camera screen through my loupe, I knew I had captured the image I wanted.</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>Damn that <a href="http://www.hartmier.com">Richard Hartmier</a>! Those of you who read my blog know how much I like and admire Richard, a friend and very capable pro photographer from the Yukon (you&#8217;ve got to be capable to make a living as a photographer in the Yukon). But, damn him all the same!
Richard managed to capture this incredible Northern Lights image just a few miles from his home in Whitehorse. Folks, this is only mid-August and it&#8217;s rare to get Northern Lights this early. But the lights are at an 11-year peak from now through 2013, which is why Richard and I are heading to Iceland together in September, 2013 to get some Fall images there, along with, hopefully, the Northern Lights. I thought I&#8217;d share Richard&#8217;s incredible image with you. It was taken next to Schwatka Lake on the outskirts of Whitehorse, the capital of Yukon Territory.</p>

<p>For now at least, Richard has the upper hand in our friendly rivalry. Damn him!</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p><a href="http://blog.lesterpickerphoto.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/08/harbor-flat-small.jpg"><img class="size-medium wp-image-2322" title="harbor-flat-small" src="http://blog.lesterpickerphoto.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/08/harbor-flat-small-300x89.jpg" alt="" width="300" height="89"></a></p>

<p> </p>

<p>If you intend to enter the world of panoramic photography, you will eventually come across the term “nodal point.” Nodal point? Did I say that?</p>

<p>Truth be known, I had already written a lengthy blog about nodal points and how they can improve your panoramas and was set to publish it  today. I had spent a few hours on Saturday determining the nodal points for each of my Hasselblad and Nikon lenses that I use for panoramic photography. As I did a last fact-check, though, I happened across a set of URLs by <a href="http://www.reallyrightstuff.com">Really Right Stuff</a>, a company that makes my tripod ball head, my camera brackets, my macro rails, and my pano equipment. After spending an hour or so with their materials I realized there was no need to do a separate blog on the topic. I’m certain you’ll find everything you want to know about panorama photography in their wonderful, easy-to-understand explanations. I’ll give you the starting URL in a moment. First a few comments.</p>

<p>Many point-and-shoot (PAS) cameras have a built in panorama feature, sometimes known as &#8220;stitching.&#8221; You simply go to the menu, tell the camera you’re about to shoot a panorama, point the camera at each section and- voila!- the camera processes a panorama for you! Pretty nifty. And the more this feature has advanced over the past few years, the better the results. If you’re happy with the panoramas you’re getting from your PAS, stop here and be very, very grateful. Here is an example of the stitching capability in the Canon G12 PAS, called &#8220;Stitch Assist.&#8221; You&#8217;ll have to study the manual carefully to uncover this function. However, it&#8217;s worth the effort.</p>

<p><a href="http://blog.lesterpickerphoto.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/08/photo.jpg"><img class="size-medium wp-image-2328" title="photo" src="http://blog.lesterpickerphoto.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/08/photo-300x225.jpg" alt="" width="300" height="225"></a></p>

<p>Naturally, there are hints to improve even a PAS in-camera pano; pre-visualize what the pano will incorporate, overlap the images by 20-30%, keep your elbows close to your body, keep the camera tight to your eye and rotate your body at the waist, keeping the camera as even and level to the ground as possible.</p>

<p>The next step, if you want higher quality images is to use a tripod, whether with a PAS or a DSLR. That way the camera stays as steady as we can possibly get it to be and we just rotate it to include as much of the scene as we wish. If you don’t have in-camera panorama capability, you simply export the images to what is known as a “stitching” program, such as <a href="http://www.ptgui.com">PTGUI</a> (yes, that’s really its name), and you’re off to the races. Alternately, PhotoShop, as well as other programs, stitch together panoramas very handily.</p>

<p>So, what is the problem and how does it relate to nodal points? Hold your thumb out at arm’s length, pointed up. Close one eye. Now , looking at the thumb, turn your head right and left. Notice how the thumb seems to move? That is known as parallax. The same thing happens when you pan your camera right and left. That makes it harder for pano software programs to work their magic.</p>

<p><a href="http://blog.lesterpickerphoto.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/08/pano-arrows.gif"><img class="size-medium wp-image-2326" title="pano-arrows" src="http://blog.lesterpickerphoto.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/08/pano-arrows-291x300.gif" alt="" width="291" height="300"></a></p>

<p>The technical explanation is complicated, but if you want to read about it in more detail, and understand how to correct for this and improve your panoramas, visit the folks at Really Right Stuff <a href="http://reallyrightstuff.com/WebsiteInfo.aspx?fc=108">for an explanation</a> (and some great equipment).</p>

<p>In <a title="Panoramas: Part 2" href="http://blog.lesterpickerphoto.com/2012/09/02/panoramas-part-2-how-i-do-it/">Part 2</a> I&#8217;ll review how I handle panoramas, using examples from my own work. Stay tuned!</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>One of the many things I love about what I do is the periodic challenge that comes up as we attempt to provide for our clients more than they expect. Recently Bob (my assistant) and I were faced with a particularly challenging challenge.</p>

<p>A Baltimore teaching hospital chose me as their exclusive artist for a new medical wing, slated to open in October. The project is massive for us, with approximately 75 of my images, some as large as 29-feet wide (on a wall covering), and others 40” wide (on classic archival photo paper and traditionally framed), plus some other specialized photographic applications. Sure, this is a major undertaking involving image selection, multiple rounds of client approvals, planning, ordering, printing, framing and, eventually, installation. I also had to do custom shooting of local Baltimore scenes. But the client requested one thing more, and therein lay the challenge.</p>

<p>As a non-profit hospital, they depend on generous donors to support their healing arts. Did we have any ideas, they wondered, how we might help them honor their donors to this state-of-the-art medical wing (without spending too much money in the process)?</p>

<p>Bob and I did some research and reached out to colleagues, such as the incredible Andy Biggs (<a href="http://www.andybiggs.com">www.andybiggs.com</a>), one of my favorite photographers. Andy suggested that we consider using individually boxed sets of images.</p>

<p>We found a small American business that creates hand-crafted, cloth-covered boxes. These one-of-a-kind boxes are as beautiful as they are functional. Since they are completely custom-made, a photographer (or other end-user) can order them in any size and depth. We knew we wanted to offer the donors about a dozen images, plus some forward materials, such as a title page, a letter from the Chief Executive and a thank you from the doctor who will be heading up the new unit.</p>

<p>Bob and I worked for weeks to develop the styling, color and design of the box. In the end we came up with a respectable mockup.</p>

<p><a href="http://blog.lesterpickerphoto.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/08/DSC9543-as-Smart-Object-1.jpg"><img class="alignnone size-medium wp-image-2350" title="_DSC9543 as Smart Object-1" src="http://blog.lesterpickerphoto.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/08/DSC9543-as-Smart-Object-1-300x198.jpg" alt="" width="300" height="198"></a></p>

<p>But we were faced with both the functional, as well as aesthetic issue of how to separate the individual prints within the box to prevent scratching. I also do not like my images to be cluttered with a descriptive title or location information right on the print. So Bob and I came up with what we think is an innovative solution.</p>

<p><a href="http://blog.lesterpickerphoto.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/08/DSC9554-as-Smart-Object-1.jpg"><img class="alignnone size-medium wp-image-2314" title="_DSC9554 as Smart Object-1" src="http://blog.lesterpickerphoto.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/08/DSC9554-as-Smart-Object-1-300x198.jpg" alt="" width="300" height="198"></a></p>

<p> </p>

<p>We are using sheets of translucent vellum to separate the prints.</p>

<p><a href="http://blog.lesterpickerphoto.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/08/DSC9563-as-Smart-Object-1.jpg"><img class="alignnone size-medium wp-image-2315" title="_DSC9563 as Smart Object-1" src="http://blog.lesterpickerphoto.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/08/DSC9563-as-Smart-Object-1-300x198.jpg" alt="" width="300" height="198"></a></p>

<p> </p>

<p>Bob masterfully printed the descriptive information on the vellum with a gorgeous screen, so that the information can always be associated with the correct image. We can’t wait to see the reactions of the donors this fall. When the actual final product is ready, we’ll do a separate shoot and share it with you. In the meantime, I’d love to get your feedback.</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>As promised, this is another in a continuing series of reviews on my experience as a pro photographer and an owner of a Hasselblad H4D-50 system. For those of you wondering what the heck that is, allow me to explain.</p>

<p><a href="http://blog.lesterpickerphoto.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/08/images.jpeg"><img class="size-full wp-image-2304" title="images" src="http://blog.lesterpickerphoto.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/08/images.jpeg" alt="" width="284" height="177"></a></p>

<p>Hasselblad is a medium format camera system. That means that the sensor is significantly larger than a standard 35mm camera and of a slightly different shape (4:3 ratio vs. 3:2 for a DSLR). Instead of the typical 12-16 megapixels (MP) per image you’ll find on most 35mm cameras, the Hasselblad (‘Hassy’) registers images at a mind-blowing 50MP. Other digital Hassy cameras record at 40, 60 and 200MP. The more pixels, the better detail there is when enlarging images. Since I often have to enlarge images to 30 or 40 inches on the short side, more pixels are a good thing. Just last week we printed wallpaper images that were 29-feet  and 19-feet wide!! That is how I justified my H4D purchase.</p>

<p>Two trips this year allowed me to test the Hassy with no-holds-barred. I spent 25 days in Sri Lanka and 16 days in Iceland, with extremes of hot and cold, humid and dry, hurricane winds and calm evenings.</p>

<p>Although I always had my Nikon system with me as backup or, in the case of action shots, as my primary system, the bottom line is that I find using the Hassy an increasingly joyful experience. After 40 years of photography, I relish the chance to use the Hassy, even preferring it over my Nikons in certain conditions (and I own the newest Nikon D800 with 36MP). Using the Hassy forces me to slow down. I find myself more thoughtfully exposing, metering and composing, and I figure that’s a good thing. There is no high speed mode. It has few fancy electronic doo-dads.  It is all about ridiculously finely engineered machinery, top quality lenses, the landscape and you. Frankly, I love that combo.</p>

<p>Most of all, my assistant, Bob Boyer, and I love the smooth, rich tonality evident in every image. It is as close to film-like as you can get, but with the added benefit of digital capture for post-processing flexibility. The files are insanely detailed, but with smooth gradations that don’t flash “DIGITAL” in your face.</p>

<p>To be honest, my Hassy does have its drawbacks, as I’ve mentioned in other blogs. Chief among them is that it is not weatherproofed. For landscape shooters that is a serious drawback. However, to be fair I did shoot with it in 70MPH hurricane force winds in Iceland and got results that I just fell in love with. Of course, I protected the camera and lens as best as I could and did not take the chance of swapping lenses in mid-shoot.</p>

<p><a href="http://blog.lesterpickerphoto.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/08/A0020169-as-Smart-Object-1.jpg"><img class="size-medium wp-image-2301" title="A0020169 as Smart Object-1" src="http://blog.lesterpickerphoto.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/08/A0020169-as-Smart-Object-1-300x225.jpg" alt="" width="300" height="225"></a></p>

<p> </p>

<p>Another drawback is its size and weight, topping the scales at 7.5 pounds for the body and a 28mm lens with the tilt-shift attachment. At my age I simply cannot use it for any length of time unless it is tripod mounted, which is fine for landscape. The camera and lenses are also bulky, forcing me to painfully agonize over my equipment choices when I travel.</p>

<p>Another factor to consider when evaluating a Hassy purchase is its price. The H4D body alone costs upwards of $30,000. Add a 28mm lens (22mm in 35mm equivalent coverage) for $4,000 and a 50-110 for $6,000 and, like Senator Everett Dirkson once said, pretty soon your talking real money. On the plus side, Hassy has recently announced a 20% price reduction, in part because of pressure from the likes of Nikon with its new D800, packing 36MP. I might add that those of us who invested in Hassy at full price are not exactly thrilled.</p>

<p>But, the proof is in the pudding and the question is: Would I do it all over again? Damn right I would!</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>It’s not often that a latest-greatest camera comes out and I feel like I have to have it. In fact, I was perfectly happy with my Nikon D700, which I’ve had since it debuted. It is a great camera; well built, easy to use, and it produces spectacular images. It is flexible and has allowed me to execute my vision, even under challenging environmental conditions. Besides, I also shoot a medium format Hasselblad H4D-50, so I had pixels if I needed them.</p>

<p> </p>

<p>When the Nikon D800 was announced I was, quite frankly, skeptical. Initial reports were that it sported a 16-megapixel (MP) sensor. Not interested. That was soon raised to 18-MP. Still not interested. Then it was 24 MP and you know what? I suddenly got interested. I had D3x envy for two years and I figured now was my time to get revenge, and at a price point some $5,000 lower! Sweet.</p>

<p> </p>

<p>And lo and behold, when the clouds parted, it came to pass that the Nikon D800 premiered at 36 MP!! Yes, you read that right. 36 glorious, huge, detailed MEGA pixels. I bought one the day Nikon announced its availability.</p>

<p> </p>

<p>Now, you’re probably wondering why I would get so excited over a camera that really doesn’t do a whole lot more than the D700. The answer lies in them thar pixels, of course. Much of my business is in large prints. Not the 12” x 18” inch variety, nor the 16” x 24” size.  Most of my prints are a minimum of 20” x 30” and bigger- a lot bigger.</p>

<p> </p>

<p>Right now I’m in the process of printing thirty, 40” x 30” images for a client, who also purchased several 4-foot wide images, some 8-footers and- ready for this one?- one 29-feet wide by 9-feet tall image! It’s just not possible to get a print even 40” wide from a 12-MP camera and have it come out at the quality I expect, even if one uses Perfect Resize or a similar software program.</p>

<p> </p>

<p>So, for this 29-foot wall I needed a solid image of Baltimore. What’s more iconic than Baltimore’s Inner Harbor, I figured? As it turned out, the week I wanted to shoot the Inner Harbor, several tall ships sailed into Baltimore in what was called a Sailabration, to celebrate the 200 year anniversary of the bombardment of Fort McHenry and Francis Scott Key’s penning of the Star Spangled Banner.</p>

<p> </p>

<p>I set up my tripod before twilight, leveled it carefully, mounted my D800 with a 200-400mm lens in vertical position, and leveled that, too, using a Really Right Stuff panning attachment. I checked my pan, left to right, up and down. Once I felt I had the right light, I started shooting. It took 9 images going from left to right to encompass the entire scene with water in the foreground. Then I repeated the sequence tilting my setup to encompass sky and shot another 9. This had to be done quickly to minimize light changes. It was also very windy that day and I had to hang my backpack from my tripod to add center mass.</p>

<p> </p>

<p>In post-processing my assistant, Bob Boyer, merged the entire shoot in PhotoShop CS6, producing this image (click on it to enlarge):</p>

<p> </p>

<p><a href="http://blog.lesterpickerphoto.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/07/harbor-flat-small.jpg"><img class="size-medium wp-image-2292" title="Baltimore Harbor" src="http://blog.lesterpickerphoto.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/07/harbor-flat-small-300x89.jpg" alt="" width="300" height="89"></a></p>

<p> </p>

<p>What I am struck with, what we were both struck with, is the level of detail in the image. Even blown up 100% or more and printed on vinyl wallpaper, the results are, to quote Bob, “freakin’ fantastic.” In the image below, note the tiny red frame within the full image in the upper right. That is the blow-up that you are looking at below. Consider this: the images were taken about a mile away, and in a stiff, gusty wind no less! Not only can you make out the lettering on the ship clearly, but you can see the couple sitting on nearby deck.</p>

<p> </p>

<p><a href="http://blog.lesterpickerphoto.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/07/harbor-screen.jpg"><img class="size-medium wp-image-2293" title="Baltimore harbor-screen shot" src="http://blog.lesterpickerphoto.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/07/harbor-screen-300x187.jpg" alt="" width="300" height="187"></a></p>

<p>So, in this test anyway, the D800 passes with flying colors! More field tests upcoming.</p>

<p>BTW, if you&#8217;re interested in Bob&#8217;s perspective on the wallpaper image and its installation, check his blog <a href="http://photo.rwboyer.com/2012/07/27/things-you-learn-in-fourth-grade/">here</a>. Bob also reminded me that the image is actually a tad bit over 30-feet wide, not 29.</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>Earlier this year I was named the winner of the Canada Northern Lights Award for my travel photography. More than 300 entries were considered from photojournalists all over the world. The Missouri School of Journalism picked the final winners for best travel writing and best photography. Needless to say (but I’ll say it anyway), I was honored.</p>

<p> </p>

<p>I was told that the award itself would arrive later. I waited and waited, but nothing arrived. In a follow-up e-mail I was told that the award was an original sculpture and would take time to hand craft.</p>

<p> </p>

<p>Just two weeks ago the award arrived and when I opened the box I could hardly believe what a beautiful work of art the award is. It was rendered by Canadian artist <a href="http://www.metalperks.com">Michael Perks</a> who lives and works in Okotoks, Alberta. Michael recently won his own award as Best New Artist at the 2011 Calgary Stampede.</p>

<p><a href="http://blog.lesterpickerphoto.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/07/Northern-Lights-Award-4-of-4.jpg"><img class="alignnone size-medium wp-image-2284" title="Canada Northern Lights Award " src="http://blog.lesterpickerphoto.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/07/Northern-Lights-Award-4-of-4-300x225.jpg" alt="" width="300" height="225"></a></p>

<p>To me, the award is so very special because of the way Michael interpreted the Northern Lights. I remember vividly the first time I witnessed the Northern Lights. I was standing on a mountaintop in Canada’s Yukon wilderness when they suddenly blazed across the sky. Nothing had prepared me for that moment. They literally took my breath away and I sank to my knees, thankful for the privilege of living in that moment. Every time I have seen them since I feel awed by their majestic, mysterious beauty. They are humbling beyond measure.</p>

<p> </p>

<p><a href="http://blog.lesterpickerphoto.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/07/Northern-Lights-Award-1-of-1.jpg"><img class="size-medium wp-image-2285" title="Northen lights over Yukon River, Dawson City, Yukon, Canada" src="http://blog.lesterpickerphoto.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/07/Northern-Lights-Award-1-of-1-300x199.jpg" alt="" width="300" height="199"></a></p>

<p>In Michael’s sculpture I see the lights streaking across the stylized mountain. As honored as I am with the award itself, I am equally honored to have Michael’s work remind me every day of the beauty one experiences uniquely in Canada’s amazing landscape.</p>
