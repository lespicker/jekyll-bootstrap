  <div class="entry-content"><p><em><strong>Warning: This is a shameless, unabashed fan blog. </strong></em></p>

<p>I was in bed last night decompressing from a wonderful family event, but a rough travel photography week in Colorado. I decided to thumb through some Instagram images and catch up with some blogs from fellow photographers. As it turns out, I hit upon images and a blog by one of my favorite photographers, <a href="http://www.tonysweet.com">Tony Sweet</a>. And sweet it was, as I perused and admired Tony’s latest work.</p>

<p><a href="http://blog.lesterpickerphoto.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/04/Tony_DVDEdisto40891-198x300.jpg"><img class="size-full wp-image-2687" title="Tony_DVDEdisto40891-198x300" src="http://blog.lesterpickerphoto.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/04/Tony_DVDEdisto40891-198x300.jpg" alt="" width="198" height="300"></a></p>

<p>However, it was <a href="http://tonysweet.com/2013/04/11/end-of-charleston-2013/">Tony’s latest blog</a> that put something in perspective for me. At the very least, I think it would benefit every photographer to read it.</p>

<p>Tony is surely one of the most prolific photographers on the scene today. He is a Nikon Legend Behind the Lens, and a consummate teacher of our craft. His workshops are typically sold out and highly praised, something I know personally because many of my own workshop participants speak glowingly of Tony.</p>

<p>Let’s put that all aside for the moment. Tony would be nothing if he did not also have the skills, experience and creativity to back it all up. And I’m talking creativity on steroids. Tony is so far ahead of the rest of us, we can only stand around and say: “Whew! Who was that masked man?” Or in Tony’s case, that bandana’d man, because of his trademark headwear. Never content to stand still photographically, Tony inspires me with his risk-taking. His work can be splendidly traditional or push-the-envelope edgy. It blazes new ground. It is splashes of color, riffs of mood, blurs of movement, and texture you can almost feel. One wonders where all that creative vision and professional intensity comes from.</p>

<p>Well, listen up, because Tony’s latest blog provides us with the answer; something I knew about Tony&#8217;s past, but never really grocked until now. I pulled this quote from his blog.</p>

<p> </p>

<p><em>“I have always gravitated to smaller, more intimate scenes, probably as an offshoot of my jazz musician training, where we think in terms of improvising over pre-determined musical forms and compositions and developing <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Leitmotif">leitmotifs</a>. This is the paradigm of my photography. I was a jazz artist for so long, that even as a professional photographer, I still think of myself (and probably always will) as a jazz musician first and foremost, always drawing on the mental processes and (as much as possible in this culture) the zen of a situation, emptying the mind of preconceptions and letting the image and/ or interpretation present itself. It’s all about personal interpretation.”</em></p>

<p> </p>

<p>I don&#8217;t know about you, but I find it somehow comforting that Tony has a jazz suite going  on in his head. He&#8217;s in his own world when it comes to photography, and that makes our world a whole lot better. Thanks, Tony.</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>I was preparing to leave for Denver airport from Boulder, en route back home. I was pretty much packed, when I decided to give myself one last photo treat. An unusual blizzard had dumped 8-10 inches of snow along a wide swath of Colorado, but the morning dawned bright and beautiful. What&#8217;s a camera jockey to do?</p>

<p>I hurriedly grabbed my Nikon D800, my 70-200 lens and my Gitzo 3541 with RRS BH-55 ballhead and dashed out the door. I drove to Chataqua Park at the base of the foothills and did some quick pano work of the iconic Flatirons, bathed in snow and sunshine.</p>

<p>These were five vertical images, shot from a level tripod. I did not have time to put on my RRS parallax adjustment jig, nor even a polarizer. Just a few sets of click-click-click-click-click and I was out of there.</p>

<p>I pieced the image together in PTGUI, did a tonal curve sitting here at the airport and here we are. Nothing fancy, but nice use of what might otherwise have been a wasted morning.</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>I attended a wonderful- and rather unique-  family event last night in downtown Denver. It was held in the iconic Clock Tower building and stretched over the four top floors in the building. Each floor had its own food offerings, plus dancing on one floor and a spectacular panoramic view of the Denver skyline from a parapet that wound around the 20th floor.</p>

<p><a href="http://blog.lesterpickerphoto.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/04/photo-copy2.jpg"><img class="size-medium wp-image-2674" title="photo copy" src="http://blog.lesterpickerphoto.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/04/photo-copy2-225x300.jpg" alt="" width="225" height="300"></a></p>

<p>Shortly after we arrived, my sister-in-law, Ruth, took out her iPhone and snapped this lovely image of the clock, from the inside of the building&#8217;s 18th floor. I was so impressed by this image for several reasons, but what it brought home to me in spades is how the creative eye trumps megapixels any day of the week.</p>

<p>It&#8217;s a strong composition, like bold paint strokes. The cut-off clock gives us a feel for the size (taller than two people atop one another). The color is nicely rendered and the contrast is perfect.</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>Yesterday I received a <a href="http://www.gigapan.com">GigaPan Epic Pro</a> and I&#8217;m already impressed. I haven&#8217;t really used it yet - just a dumb indoor pano as a sort of &#8216;proof of concept&#8217; for my own edification.</p>

<p><a href="http://blog.lesterpickerphoto.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/03/epic-pro.png"><img class="size-medium wp-image-2667" title="epic-pro" src="http://blog.lesterpickerphoto.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/03/epic-pro-145x300.png" alt="" width="145" height="300"></a></p>

<p> </p>

<p>Over the next few weeks, once I&#8217;ve had a chance to look through the manual and get the apparatus up and running, I&#8217;ll report back to you on my impressions of this machine.</p>

<p>For those of you who do not know about the GigaPan technology, it is an award winning (Editor&#8217;s Choice Award from Popular Photography and American Photo) computerized robot to which you anchor your camera/lens, show it what panoramic photo you want to take, press a few buttons and PRESTO, in minutes you have a gigantonormous image with, say 10, 20, 50, even 500 Gigabytes of information in it!! No, that&#8217;s not a misprint. People have actually composed pano images with the GigaPan using a Hasselbald 50 MP camera and taking 500 images. Think of how many gigabyte files THAT produces!</p>

<p>The GigaPan is a commercial spin-off of the technology from Carnegie-Mellon University that is currently being used on the Mars Rover missions. As you can see from the photo, you mount it on your tripod , program its functions and let it rip away. Videos on the GigaPan site show you how it&#8217;s done. What attracted us is that the resulting images have such a high level of detail it should satisfy our clients&#8217; needs for ultra-large images. Last year, for example, we <a href="http://www.lesterpickerphoto.com/commercial-installations/">produced a pano image</a> that covered 30-feet by 9-feet. We did it without a GigaPan, but had we used the GigaPan it would have made the job easier and given us evenmore detail.</p>

<p>So, I can&#8217;t wait to jump in and give this baby a whirl! Stay tuned.</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>Over the past few months, as my associate, Bob, and I have revised our website and planned for 2013, we have been thinking about and discussing the issue of Limited Edition prints quite a bit. They are an integral part of our business and an art form that we take particular pride in.</p>

<p>For those of you who do not know it, Bob is a Master Printer with credentials that would fill a book. We have recently been working with Museo Fine Art Digital Media and their luscious archival papers to create some of the finest photographic prints available anywhere for collectors. So, naturally, we have a lot at stake with our Limited Editions.</p>

<p><a href="http://blog.lesterpickerphoto.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/03/LAP1377.jpg"><img class="size-medium wp-image-2662" title="LAP1377" src="http://blog.lesterpickerphoto.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/03/LAP1377-300x200.jpg" alt="" width="300" height="200"></a></p>

<p> </p>

<h3>Our Process</h3>


<p>In the way of background, like some of my colleagues, our print runs are of either 10 or 25. Mostly they are 30&#8221; x 40&#8221;, but if someone custom orders a larger (or smaller) size, we count those toward the total, so that the 10 and 25 counts are never exceeded.</p>

<p>In our case, the prints are laboriously hand-made. Bob and I will sit down and carefully analyze my images for potential LE status. Once candidates are selected we apply strict criteria to them to ensure that they are truly exceptional images. Then the real work begins.</p>

<p>Dust and water spots are tediously removed. We go over every square inch of the digital image in post-processing to make sure that it will print to our highest standards, spending hours and several trial prints to &#8220;get it right.&#8221; We use our own Epson 9900 or Canon professional printers with the finest archival inks to generate our prints. We print mostly on Museo Fine Art archival, museum-quality papers. Each image is printed to order (except for ones we hang in galleries). Once dried we inspect the print and only a flawless image will get my signature.</p>

<p>Bob then prints a gorgeous Certificate of Authenticity, with several security features, so that our art clientele can feel comfortable with their purchase, knowing that if they resell it later they can prove its legitimacy.</p>

<p><a href="http://blog.lesterpickerphoto.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/03/DSC_3582.jpg"><img class="size-medium wp-image-2663" title="DSC_3582" src="http://blog.lesterpickerphoto.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/03/DSC_3582-300x200.jpg" alt="" width="300" height="200"></a></p>

<p>I&#8217;m only describing our process as an example of how I know many of my colleagues work, irrespective of print run. The question is, why do we declare so few of my images to be Limited Editions and print them in such small runs?</p>

<p> </p>

<h3>What is a Limited Edition Print? Really.</h3>


<p>The answer is fairly complex, but it mostly boils down to the fact that we take the &#8220;Limited&#8221; part of the phrase rather seriously - and very literally. Partly it is also due to the fact that I am at a different point in the arc of my work, having reached the ripe (but not old) age of 65. My kids are thankfully out of the house, and I don&#8217;t have to worry about paying the rent or putting food on the table today. And, perhaps most importantly, I am at a different place in my art where I view Limited Editions with a highly critical eye, some say too critically. If I consider an image a work of art, I want to make sure that that it will be very special to my buyers and will hold its value over time.</p>

<p>I do realize that other photographers feel very differently about Limited Editions. Some turn a lot of their images into Limited Editions. Others consider print runs of 500, 1,000 or even 5,000 to be Limited Editions (yes, I ran across this in a gallery I recently visited run by an incredibly talented photographer).</p>

<p>I am not denigrating the work of other photographers, whatever their view on Limited Editions. If a business model works for a sustained period of time, that means that happy customers are involved. But I do think that a case can be made that the concept of Limited Editions has been diluted by print runs that, by definition, can hardly be considered limited.</p>

<p><strong>And so, I turn the issue back to you readers. What do you think?</strong></p>

<p> </p>

<p>I&#8217;d like to enlist your help with something. We recently revised our website to make it more functional for our visitors. Last week we added a &#8220;Gallery&#8221; function so that you will be able to see samples of my work in various categories.</p>

<p>I would truly appreciate it if you would <a href="http://www.lesterpickerphoto.com/gallery/">visit the Gallery</a> and give me some feedback on it how it functions for you. With today&#8217;s hectic schedules I know that is asking a lot of you, but if you can swing perhaps 10 minutes, I would be very grateful.</p>

<p>Some things to consider:</p>

<p>Do you like the way the Gallery categories scroll up and down?</p>

<p>Did you try to make the images full screen (button on lower right)? If so, how did that work for you (please let us know what computer you were using and whether it was PC/Mac)?</p>

<p>Do you like the way you can view thumbnails on the bottom of the pages by running your cursor over them?</p>

<p>Any other functions you like or dislike? Any you found difficult to navigate? Any suggestions for improvement?</p>

<p>Feel free to leave your comments right here at the end of this blog. Thanks in advance for your help.</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>Admittedly I have arthritis in a fairly big way, mostly in my back and neck. I like to think that it&#8217;s the result of having been stupid enough to play football in high school when I weighed 150 pounds soaking wet and my team&#8217;s offensive line averaged 205 pounds (with me on it)! But, as my wife keeps pointing out, I can hardly blame that anymore.</p>

<p>Here you can see the REAL reason for my back woes.</p>

<p><a href="http://blog.lesterpickerphoto.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/03/IMG_11522.jpg"><img class="alignnone size-medium wp-image-2647" title="IMG_1152" src="http://blog.lesterpickerphoto.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/03/IMG_11522-225x300.jpg" alt="" width="225" height="300"></a></p>

<p>We were hiking in Kipahulu, Maui when she snapped this photo. Thank God for LowePro&#8217;s terrific backpack, which serves to distribute the weight as best it can. But I&#8217;m packing 30-35 pounds of gear, PLUS my Gitzo 3541 tripod and RRS BH-55 ballhead which together weigh an additional 8 pounds. We hiked four very rugged miles that morning, before doing another strenuous hike later that day.</p>

<p>Here I am going down a trail, so you can get a better view of the pack.</p>

<p>In it I have two camera systems, each with a body and 2-3 lenses, plus filters, cleaning gear, storage cards, and assorted gizmos. Plus critically important snacks. The LowePro Trekker AW400 has a water bladder right inside the pack, making it ideal for trekking, although once in the Yukon in winter it ended up being an ice bladder.</p>

<p>My point here is that nature photography is much more than a camera and lens, especially at my age. I probably own more backpacks and cases than Imelda Marcus had shoes. But I consider them a critical investment in myself. After hours of hiking my back may be a little sore, but it&#8217;s still functional, so long as I have a solid pack that is distributed well. I am also a bug on strap adjustments and regularly empty my pack when I arrive home, clean it out and remount it on my back empty so I can check the straps and adjust them for even placement.</p>

<p>Of course, what I&#8217;m really hoping for is an eager assistant who would be willing to carry my pack for me. Dream on, right?</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>I don&#8217;t mean to be alarmist, but if you are anywhere in the vicinity of where I am taking pictures, please take note. Both Nikon and Hasselblad have installed a TOP SECRET <em>MAGNETETRON</em> in their respective cameras that they sold to me. I have been aware of it for several years now, but my wife finally confirmed it with the picture below. Allow me to explain.</p>

<p>It seems as if every time I stop in a location to photograph, within a few minutes  a flock of people will suddenly stop, get out of their car, and snap away. This has happened so often I just knew that my cameras had this super-powerful magnet hidden inside that draws in people like, well, a magnet! Some examples&#8230;</p>

<p>I once had a tiny little foreign tourist actually shove me away from where I was standing and snap away with her equally tiny camera while I was photographing whales five years ago. In the Yukon I have had a busload of tourists come to a rumbling halt and disgorge 15 people, along with a cloud of dust, right where I stood with a camera and strap on my shoulder (the truth is that I had just stopped to pee, but that&#8217;s another story).</p>

<p>No matter where I am the same thing happens. Last year I was in a remote location two days from civilization and a passing hiker laden with what looked like a three-story, two-ton backpack actually stopped, took out his camera from under some pots and pans and stood not six inches from me to take a photo. Okay, I&#8217;m exaggerating&#8230; he was 12 inches from me.</p>

<p>In Hawaii last week I stopped at a lookout that barely fit two cars on a narrow, winding road overlooking a 500-foot drop. Still, several other cars stopped - one of them on the road!- and people got out to take a picture. Aha!! This time my wife caught them in the act!</p>

<p> </p>

<p>So, there, proof of my Magnetetron theory. But, beware ladies. My Magnetetron also makes highly detailed images of your naked torsos. You have been warned!</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>Today is my last day in Hawaii. After time spent on Kauai and Maui, my gear is all packed and ready for the red-eye flight back to the cold and freezing rain of Maryland.</p>

<p>In terms of photography, I felt it was a mixed bag (see my previous blogs from Hawaii). I managed to have some really good days, with outstanding images, but other days were a struggle. There were the typical weather issues (I don&#8217;t mind rain, but rain mixed with blustery winds drives me nuts!). Then on my last few days my Hasselblad malfunctioned and I&#8217;m not sure what that is all about. I&#8217;ll get it looked at as soon as I get home. However, my Nikon D800 came through for me, as Nikon invariably does. In any case, no complaints here. As George Lepp once said, there can&#8217;t be a bad day for a nature photographer. I agree. </p>

<p>So, here is my parting Hawaii image, taken with my wife&#8217;s iPhone. Until next time!</p>
