  <div class="entry-content"><p>Okay, prep time is finally over and we’re off on our Canadian Rockies adventure. Normally I’d be traveling alone if I were on assignment, but in this case I happily have my wife and granddaughter accompanying me so that I can write some travel articles from a family and, specifically, an intergenerational perspective.</p>

<p>I love travel, but I hate traveling. Travel has become such a hassle in the past decade. As if the airlines weren’t bad enough on their own, the security hassles alternate between ridiculous and absurd. Drag suitcases down the stairs, into the car, out of the car, onto the shuttle bus, off the shuttle bus, onto the ticket counter scale. Now, wait 30 minutes in line, take off the shoes and belt, empty pockets, take out laptop, shuffle through security.</p>

<p>“Hey, that’s a lot of camera equipment you have,” the TSA agent asks, suspiciously  (what, they’ve never seen cameras and lenses before?). Open the bag, remove the cameras and lenses, disassemble, show them to the officer, repack them, re-dress and you’re on your way. Have a pleasant flight!</p>

<p><a href="http://blog.lesterpickerphoto.com/wp-content/uploads/2010/08/CanadianRockiesLoop2010-BWI-42010-08-09.jpg"><img class="size-medium wp-image-459" title="CanadianRockiesLoop2010-BWI 42010-08-09" src="http://blog.lesterpickerphoto.com/wp-content/uploads/2010/08/CanadianRockiesLoop2010-BWI-42010-08-09-300x199.jpg" alt="" width="300" height="199"></a></p>

<p>For those of you who haven’t yet sampled Baltimore Washington International Thurgood Marshall Airport’s international terminal, well, consider keeping it that way. It’s tiny and the amenities, if that’s what they call them, are sparse. We arrived at 7:45 A.M. for a 9:30 flight. There are 3 commercial properties in the entire terminal: a duty-free shop that mainly peddles alcohol, a Hudson News magazine stand and Formaggio, essentially a bar with some tables. Fortunately, the bar also sells microwave egg and cheese sandwiches, choice of bagel, English muffin or croissant and your salt loading for the day.</p>

<p>Actually, the flight itself was pleasant. Air Canada has its act together and runs smoothly out of BWI. Its flight attendants are actually attendant. All in all, a very pleasant flight. I travel to Canada a lot and I always find friendlier skies over Canada.</p>

<p><a href="http://blog.lesterpickerphoto.com/wp-content/uploads/2010/08/CanadianRockiesLoop2010-Vancouver-662010-08-09.jpg"><img class="size-medium wp-image-460" title="CanadianRockiesLoop2010-Vancouver 662010-08-09" src="http://blog.lesterpickerphoto.com/wp-content/uploads/2010/08/CanadianRockiesLoop2010-Vancouver-662010-08-09-199x300.jpg" alt="" width="199" height="300"></a></p>

<p>BWI to Toronto, then on to Vancouver. I love Vancouver. Great city, great sites, terrific parks and ethnic restaurants up the wazoo, befitting the international city it is. I love seeing the Pacific and mountains in the same view. We stayed at the Sheraton Wall Centre, a perfect downtown location.</p>

<p>We ate dinner at Azia, a slightly upscale Asian restaurant jut off the corner of Burrard and Smithe. Open just four years. Great menu. High energy, accommodating wait staff. We started with 3 rejuvenating pots of green tea , followed by an appetizer of dim sum shrimp with spicy sauce. That was followed by two dishes that the three of us shared; General Tsao’s Shrimp and Seafood Curry Hot Pot. The shrimp was perfectly fried, crisp with a sauce that had just enough bite to let you know you had tasted something special. The hit pot had shrimp, scallops, green beans, and eggplant, all swimming in a curry sauce to die for. On the side we added coconut rice, steamed and wrapped in a banana leaf. Azia is now a new Vancouver favorite. The total tab was $51.00.</p>

<p>It’s an early night tonight. Tomorrow we get up early to be at the Rocky Mountaineer train by 7:00 A.M. for our trip to Jasper and Banff. Stay tuned!</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>Soul of the Desert</p>

<p>by Lester Picker</p>

<p>[This article originally appeared in <em>The Baltimore Sun</em> Travel section.]</p>

<p>The ringing in my ears has finally stopped. Only now, for the first time since I arrived 36 hours ago, can I hear the true sound of The Great Sakhara, Egypt’s Eastern Desert. Silence. Utter, absolute, total quiet. A silence far, far deeper than even Thoreau’s New England forest solitude.</p>

<p>In the desolate landscape of The Great Sakhara there are no tree leaves to rustle in the wind. In fact, other than for a short time in the morning and evening, there is no wind. Trees, like the acacia, are few and laced with thorns and rigid, needle-like leaves. There are no sounds of babbling brooks. No crickets chirping. No car engines in the distance or airplanes buzzing overhead. Just a silence like I have never experienced before in my life, a stillness that strips away the noisy veneer of our twenty-first century existence and penetrates to one’s core.</p>

<p>On the surface, I have come to this desert to research material for a book I am writing. But, I soon realize that this immense tract of barren sands, with its deeply etched mountains and boulder-strewn wadis has its own agenda. Sheikh Abdel Zaher Soliman, my guide and a Bedouin leader of the Ma’aza tribe of the Khushmaan clan knows this. He has waited patiently for its effects to take hold on me. I tell him with wonder what has just happened to me and he smiles, one of the many smiles of acknowledgement I will see on his face over the next few days. Abdel Zaher tells me that those infrequent visitors who do come here carry inside their heads the noises from where they came. And then The Great Sakhara works its magic.</p>

<h3>An inauspicious beginning</h3>


<p><a href="http://blog.lesterpickerphoto.com/wp-content/uploads/2010/07/egypt-1-of-5.jpg"><img class="size-medium wp-image-403" title="eastern desert bedouin" src="http://blog.lesterpickerphoto.com/wp-content/uploads/2010/07/egypt-1-of-5-225x300.jpg" alt="" width="225" height="300"></a></p>

<p>I found out about Abdel Zaher (pronounced Abdel Zahr) through a colleague who spent years living with the Bedouins. But, finding Abdel Zaher in concept and finding him in the flesh are two different things. He has no real address, other than a neighborhood at the edge of the Red Sea resort town of Hurghada.</p>

<p>I finally located his house by asking several people in the neighborhood. I arrived at 1:00 on a hot afternoon, about an hour behind schedule. I was greeted by one of Abdel Zaher’s 15 children, who brought me inside to meet Mona Farouk, one of Abdel Zaher’s two wives, a gracious woman who welcomed me warmly.</p>

<p>Abdel Zaher, she explained, was “in the desert.” He would return when he returned. Period. Sit down, eat, make yourself comfortable. In the four hours spent in their modest house, I was introduced to more than half his children and many relatives. The children flow freely from one mother’s household to the other, and each refers to both women as their mother. A little after 5:00 that evening, Abdel Zaher appeared, amidst much fanfare.</p>

<p>Abdel Zaher Soliman is a small, sinewy and very, very proud Bedouin, the last of a dying breed of nomadic people. His father was a revered Bedouin leader and as a child and young man Abdel Zaher grew up roaming the Eastern Desert from the Nile River to the Red Sea along a wide swath traditionally belonging to his clan. Now, as more and more Bedouins opt for life in small cities, Abdel Zaher makes his living as a desert guide for people serious about learning the desert’s ways. Unfortunately, Abdel Zaher speaks no English, although I suspect that he knows a few words but simply refuses to use them.</p>

<p>The next morning, we started early, buying fresh fruits, vegetables, breads and cheeses for the trek. Since Bedouins eat meat infrequently, and I am a vegetarian, we finish at the souk in less than 30 minutes, throwing the provisions and our gear into the back of Abdel Zaher’s battered, front-wheel drive Toyota pickup.</p>

<p>Driving out of Hurghada, the stark desert mountains to the west loom into view, larger and more forbidding with every passing mile. Abdel Zaher starts a dialogue that will form the basis of our communications, and one that will improve my Arabic language skills immensely over the next four days. When he explains something he stops and asks if I understand him. If not, he patiently, softly, repeats himself, drawing objects in the sand, or gesturing until I understand him clearly. I write down words and expressions that are new to me, which pleases him greatly.</p>

<p>Ninety minutes into the drive we reach a “Bedouin village” staged for day-trek tourists, although several of Abdel Zaher’s family and friends actually do live there, in a section off-limits to tourists. Like two of Abdel Zaher’s relatives I met in his house, I notice that several of the children are deaf mutes, the result of inbreeding. When I ask Abdel Zaher about it, he explains that is Allah’s way, but that all people within the tribe contribute to daily chores and are loved, an acceptance I see repeatedly throughout my stay. We sip tea with a friend of his father’s, then leave to drive another six hours into the deep desert.</p>

<p><strong>The Eastern Desert</strong></p>

<p>The Ma’aza tribe traditionally roamed an area of some 56,000 square miles, roughly the size of the state of Indiana, occupying about 8.5% of Egypt’s land mass. The area is so inhospitable, it has one of the lowest population densities on earth, fewer than one person per sixty square miles. It has not rained in the Eastern Desert for five long years. Yet, even when it does, annual rainfall averages about one-tenth of an inch. During summer, temperatures can reach over 110 degrees Fahrenheit for days and nights at a time. During winter, when I am here, temperatures can reach 90 degrees during the day and plummet to freezing at night.</p>

<p><a href="http://blog.lesterpickerphoto.com/wp-content/uploads/2010/08/egypt-desert-1-of-1.jpg"><img class="size-medium wp-image-439" title="eastern desert" src="http://blog.lesterpickerphoto.com/wp-content/uploads/2010/08/egypt-desert-1-of-1-259x300.jpg" alt="" width="259" height="300"></a></p>

<p>Driving in the Eastern Desert is an endless series of detours. The mountains are so steep, rising in places to more than 7,000 feet, and so impossibly rugged and devoid of plants, they cannot be traversed easily by foot or at all by vehicle. So, driving from one point to another involves traveling in the dry river and sea beds, known as wadis. You travel from one sand and rock-strewn wadi to another to get around a mountain. Since a wadi might be miles long, the process is a first rate geography lesson in why caravan routes were so important and well defined in ancient cultures. In an environment where temperatures can be so brutal, you had better know intimately where water, game and good shelter can be found.</p>

<p>The Eastern Desert’s mountains were also the source of much of ancient Egypt’s gold, although their uncanny ability to discover and mine the precious metal left subsequent prospectors high and dry. A recently discovered, 2,900 year old papyrus pinpoints the location of the old Pharaonic mines and a new venture is seeking to extract gold from those deposits.</p>

<p>At a watering hole, I ask Abdel Zaher about another valuable resource, the Nubian goats that are ever-present in Bedouin camps. He explains to me the process of making water bags from goat skins. Since resources are so precious to a subsistence people, the goat is fully utilized, from the hide (think not-yet-prime-time Gucci bags) and meat (usually only on festive occasions), to the horns (medicine containers, knife handles and decorations), and sinew (for sewing).</p>

<p>As we drive through the heat and dust, I notice isolated trees here and there, scattered unpredictably in the sun-baked wadis. These are acacia trees, made famous in antiquity by the ancient Egyptians who utilized every part of this valuable resource. The spiny leaves of every orange-trunked tree we pass is eaten up to the reach of camels.</p>

<p>Finally, after a full day of driving, taking notes and photographing the striking beauty of the desolate landscape, Abdel Zaher chooses a spot to make camp. With the sun beginning its long process of setting behind the mountains, I help Abdel Zaher pick some dried brush, which he breaks up and carefully arranges in the firepit. He then scoops up a large pile of dried camel dung, each oval pellet about the size of a prune, into his robe and dumps them into the firepit, then lights the mixture with a match. The dung makes a great fire and I find, much to my surprise, smells good, too.</p>

<p>With the fire now generating the hot coals Abdel Zaher will need to cook in, I’m able to relax and I turn to see the sun setting behind the mountains to our west. The sunlight, filtered through desert dust, paints a canvas of warm reds and vivid oranges that are breathtaking, bathing the eastern mountains of our wadi in a warm golden glow .</p>

<p><strong>Dinner for two</strong></p>

<p>With the light fast fading, we eat a meal of beans and spices, known as fool, heated in a small pot on the edge of the coals. We take turns scooping up portions of the flavorful beans with pieces of whole wheat pita bread, called eish baladi, heated by throwing them into the coals for a few seconds (yes, camel dung and all) to warm them up. We also dip our bread into a creamy feta cheese and munch on fresh vegetables.</p>

<p>As soon as we finish dinner, Abdel Zaher quietly moves away from the fire, turns toward Mecca, and begins his evening prayers. I marvel at the intimate connections this man has with his environment and his God.</p>

<p><strong>Turning in</strong></p>

<p>By 8:00 PM, we are more than ready for sleep. Abdel Zaher makes a semi-circular windbreak from dried brush to shelter us from the evening winds that will soon begin. We prepare the sand, Abdel Zaher’s colorful, woolen Bedouin blankets and my sleeping bag and climb in. But, as the night sky darkens to pitch black, I am awed by the crystal-clear light show taking place overhead. Abdel Zaher draws in the sand for me how the Bedouins use the rotation of the constellations to follow the seasons. He also points out to me a diffuse light source on the horizon that I would never have noticed on my own. It is the lights from Luxor, some 200 kilometers away. When he was a child, the desert was truly black at night, he sighs.</p>

<p>We also discuss religion and Abdel Zaher’s intolerance for Muslim fundamentalists who believe that there is only one way to know God. I fall asleep, content, as the gentle winds begin to flow across the desert floor.</p>

<p>Suddenly, after midnight, I am awakened by what seems like someone shining a flashlight in my eyes. It is the moon, shining so brightly, it lights up the entire wadi, bathing the surrounding mountains in a bright glow, as if someone had simply turned on a light switch. I also notice that the temperature has plummeted to just above freezing. I am finding it hard to keep warm and even my eyes hurt from the intense cold. I pull a spare t-shirt over my eyes and head to keep warm.</p>

<p><strong>Day 2</strong></p>

<p>At sunrise, I open my eyes to mountains bathed in a smoky, ethereal glow, lit in soft, warm copper tones by the early morning sun. Silence again. Total and complete silence, punctuated by Abdel Zaher’s regular breathing.</p>

<p>As Abdel Zaher prepares a simple breakfast for us, I note his slow and deliberate movements, a practice reinforced by an unforgiving environment where any mistake can be fatal. I am beginning to understand how the Eastern Desert afforded the ancient Egyptians such secure protection from invaders.</p>

<p>Abdel Zaher is eager to show me a special sight, so we soon pack and leave our campsite. As we drive, he is always telling me exactly where we are by naming each mountain, each wadi, each water hole. Knowing the names of geographical landmarks is critical in The Great Sakhara, because to give wrong directions can and has often meant death from dehydration. In his quiet voice, Abdel Zaher tells me he knows many people who have died this way. Along popular caravan routes, rock cairns, which the Bedouin call “rriggin,” mark trails to water or trade routes.</p>

<p>But, the naming process is made easier by one of the most unique aspects of the Eastern Desert. Its barren mountains are one of four distinct and separate colors, a striking feature that is riveting. Green, red, black and white mountains dominate one or another section of desert,  the sand surrounding them reflecting their color. Yet the tones of those colors are ever-changing, as the sun moves across the sky.</p>

<p><strong>The acacia preserve</strong></p>

<p>It is now 5:00 PM and it is still 85 degrees, but I’m not sweating due to the dry desert air. But I am shivering a bit, because I am walking in one of the most unique spots of the Eastern Desert, a grove of some 1,200 acacia trees that the Bedouins have self-designated as a preserve. Concerned about overuse of the valuable trees, the grove stands as a silent reminder of similar groves that once dotted the desert but are no more.</p>

<p>But this grove is so spiritual, so elegant in its simple beauty, I am reminded of a Japanese Zen garden, except this one is in the middle of nowhere, completely surrounded by towering mountains in all four colors.  While Abdel Zaher prays, I meditate on a ridge overlooking the acacia grove.</p>

<p>Today has been a wonderful day, full of learning about water sources, mountains and folk medicines made from plants. As night falls, I feel more attuned to the natural rhythm of the desert and to my own internal rhythm. I eagerly await the starry light show, but before I know it, my eyes close and reopen to the sun peeking above the nearby mountain.</p>

<p><strong>Day 3: Tracking an Ibex</strong></p>

<p>I start the day cleaning my cameras from the sand dust that covers everything here. Following a breakfast of tea, bread and cheese, we are off. In an hour, Abdel Zaher stops the truck, peers into the distance and gets out. We walk for about 15 minutes to the base of a mountain, where he stoops down and points out to me a set of tracks.</p>

<p>There have been gazelles here recently, he says, and an Ibex was here within the past hour, in all probability scared off by the sounds of our truck. He looks up at the mountain, and motions me back to the truck.</p>

<p>In a few minutes we stop along a ridge and I see a group of gazelles running across the wadi, perhaps a half-mile from us. They are a beautiful sight, with their tan shoulders and white underbellies, leaping and darting across the desert floor faster than I could have imagined.</p>

<p>Seeing my excitement, Abdel Zaher asks if I want to see an Ibex. We ride to the back of the mountain where he had first spotted the tracks and begin to climb. By mid-morning, Abdel Zaher motions for me to crouch and be quiet. He points. On a rock face some 100 feet ahead and above us is an incredible sight, a lone male Ibex, perched precariously on a rocky outcropping. We spend the next couple of hours following and photographing this perfect specimen.</p>

<p><strong>Lessons in humanity and the divine</strong></p>

<p>As each day’s adventures merged into the next, I began to settle into the desert experience and extract from it the lessons I had come to learn. Paramount among them is the relationship between the desert and its Bedouin people, an intricately interwoven connection that is both deep and profound.</p>

<p>One night I asked Abdel Zaher if he would come to America to visit me, so I could repay his being such a gracious host to me. “You must not have big deserts there,” he quietly told me, “because Americans come here to study The Great Sakhara. If you don’t have a desert like this, why would I want to go there?”</p>

<p>The relationship between the Bedouins and their environment is intertwined with their deep spiritual beliefs. Perhaps it is the time they have to contemplate, but I found the strong personal connections that Bedouins feel to God to be inclusive. Sitting by the fire one evening, Abdel Zaher confided in me his disdain for fundamentalist Muslim clerics who preach intolerance. “What difference is it if you are People of the Book (Jews) or Christians? We all worship Allah. Everyone should be left to do that as they wish.”</p>

<p><a href="http://blog.lesterpickerphoto.com/wp-content/uploads/2010/07/egypt-5-of-5.jpg"><img class="size-medium wp-image-406 " title="eastern desert" src="http://blog.lesterpickerphoto.com/wp-content/uploads/2010/07/egypt-5-of-5-195x300.jpg" alt="" width="156" height="240"></a></p>

<p>Late in the afternoon, I spotted a cave high up on a mountain. I asked Abdel Zaher if he would stop, so I could climb to it. He smiled and stopped, staying behind while I climbed up. The cave was certainly appealing from the ground, but it was absolutely awesome as I approached. A huge, nearly perfectly arched entranceway framed the shallow cave. The path going up and the floor of the cave itself was littered with ibex scat. The cave, some 700 feet up, had bat guano on its walls. A few broken branches littered the floor in one spot. But, it was the view from the cave that took my breath away. I was looking out over a panorama of desert wadi, framed by rugged mountains that had taken us over an hour to drive through, all in one vista.</p>

<p>I sat down and surrendered to the moment, to the silence and penetrating solitude of this magical place. I meditated, then noticed that Abdel Zaher had climbed the mountain from another direction and was standing next to me. Yes, he had visited here many times he told me, but not recently. Here were the sticks in the cave that he had stocked several years ago to make a fire in case a heavy rain surprised his tribe while they were in this wadi. We sat there a few more minutes. “You know,” I said to Abdel Zaher, “I can feel Allah’s presence here right now.” He smiled at me, reached over and held my hand in both his leathery hands. We sat like that for a few minutes before walking quietly back down the mountain.</p>

<p><strong>Day 4: Relationships</strong></p>

<p>Despite my eagerness to learn about the desert, if I were to be asked about what made my experience so unique, my answer would have to be the Bedouin people themselves. They are a people governed by daily relationships, by common bonds used to strengthen themselves to better cope with an environment that is one of the most unforgiving on earth.</p>

<p>Throughout our trek, we would periodically pass a family of Bedouins living in the desert, usually at the base of a mountain. As a tribal leader, Abdel Zaher would stop each time to check on his people, which on several occasions ended up being one of his fifteen children or many grandchildren. Everyone would kiss and hug and greet Abdel Zaher, share stories and offer us food, usually tea and bread.</p>

<p>On our last day together, we drove for more than two hours, through wadis and around mountains to visit Abdel Zaher’s sister, Saida, whom he had not seen in weeks. Her family lived out in the open, their only shelter a rocky outcropping.</p>

<p>The joy on her face on seeing her brother was carved deeply in the wrinkles of her eyes, the only part of her face I ever saw. She and her brother hugged and kissed, then she poignantly grabbed his hand in both of hers and spent minutes kissing it and rubbing it gently on her cheeks. I was so moved by the experience, I felt tears welling in my eyes.</p>

<p>We feasted on fiteera, a flat bread Saida made from scratch, yogurt, fool, and creamed feta cheese with vegetables. We also had eggplants grilled directly in the coals of a camel dung fire. As we ate, Saida’s two young daughters played with a stack of empty film containers I gave them.</p>

<p>Driving back to Hurghada, I asked  Abdel Zaher why he didn’t run day safaris and make lots of money like some of his relatives now do. “I’ve got so many blessings,” he said. “I’m the happiest man. I don’t need more money.” We drove in silence for another hour.</p>

<p>“Abdel Zaher, what will happen to the Bedouins in five or ten years?” I asked later that afternoon, as we approached Hurghada at the end of my journey.</p>

<p>“In ten years,” he said, “there will still be a few Bedouins, but in twenty, there will be no more Bedouins living in The Great Sakhara. They have been too tempted by money. The government has done too good a job of forcing them to settle in towns.”</p>

<p>The sadness of Abdel Zaher’s comments still plague me. I shudder to think of the loss of this wonderful nomadic culture, with its emphasis on family, environment and God. Most of all, and I know how selfish this sounds, I will miss the wisdom of men like Abdel Zaher. It was the desert that initially drew me to better understand its mysteries. But, it is the people of The Great Sakhara that will bring me back later this year to better understand myself.</p>

<p><strong>Desert Equipment List for 5-Days in Winter</strong></p>

<p>2-3 sets of clothes</p>

<p>Two pairs of sunglasses</p>

<p>Camera and camera cleaning equipment, especially compressed air</p>

<p>Film</p>

<p>Sunblock (minimum SPF 30)</p>

<p>Wide-brimmed hat</p>

<p>Neck covering</p>

<p>High tech water purifier bottle (<a href="http:/www.magellan.com">www.magellan.com</a>)</p>

<p>Comfortable walking shoes that breathe (no boots)</p>

<p>Cushioned socks</p>

<p>Good medical kit, including syringes, rehydration mixes, Immodium, Pepto Bismol tablets, and first aid items</p>

<p>Down sleeping bag with head covering (or wool stocking cap)</p>

<p>Inflatable pillow</p>

<p>Notebook and pens</p>

<p>Candies, cookies or trinkets for Bedouin children</p>

<p>Sense of humor</p>

<p>Leave your cell phone at home. They don’t work in the desert, and if you think you need one here, you’re missing the point.</p>

<p>Don’t bring chocolate into the desert with you, unless you want to find out what the peanuts in a Snickers bar look like nude, without any chocolate or caramel covering, which will now be coating your suitcase.</p>

<p>Bring an interpreter with you, or hire one in Cairo or Hurghada, if you cannot speak basic Arabic.</p>

<p><strong>Essential Arabic: A Primer</strong></p>

<p>Egyptians speak Arabic and truly appreciate anyone even trying to speak their language. Although you will find some people on the street who speak English in tourist areas, you may not find bilingual people in rural areas and most certainly not among the Bedouins. Here is a selection of  words and phrases, but it’s up to you if you want to trust Arabic pronunciation to a Jewish guy from Brooklyn. However, all pronunciations have been checked with Ayman Ali, an Egyptian Arabic instructor in Baltimore. Arabic is a difficult language for Westerners, characterized by gutteral sounds, glottal stops and gender-specific words. Here I use the standard ‘kh’ designation for the gutteral ‘ch’ sound, as in Chanukah. Words in parenthesis indicate usage when addressing a woman.</p>

<p>Min fadlak (fadlik): please</p>

<p>Shukrahn: thank you</p>

<p>Kweyeiss: good; fine</p>

<p>Sabah el kheer: Hello (from morning to mid-afternoon)</p>

<p>Massah el kheer: Hello from mid-afternoon through evening</p>

<p>Aiwa:            yes</p>

<p>La’:             no</p>

<p>Anna mish fayim: I don’t understand</p>

<p>Anna assif: I’m sorry</p>

<p>El hamdulallah: Thank God</p>

<p>Mafish mooshkella: No problem</p>

<p>Izzayik inaharda: How are you today?</p>

<p>El hammam feeen, min fadlak (fadlik)?: Where is the bathroom, please? (don’t bother asking the Bedouins this question, though, as 56,000 square miles of bathroom surround you. Good luck finding a handy bush or tree.)</p>

<p>Ma’ah salemma:             goodbye</p>

<p>Sahlem alaykoom:            alternate goodbye preferred by Bedouins</p>

<p><strong>Getting there</strong>: The takeoff point for The Eastern Desert is the Red Sea resort town of Hurghada. From Cairo, the best way to get to Hurghada is by a short flight using Egypt Air. Alternately, there is train service from Cairo to Hurghada. If you are combining sightseeing with an Eastern Desert experience, it is not always easy getting from Luxor, for example, to Hurghada. EgyptAir flights are sporadic. You can make the 5-hour journey by public bus, which is inexpensive (about $5 USD each way) and is usually comfortable. Or, you can rent a private taxi, for about $50 USD each way. If you go the taxi route, you are only allowed to leave at specific times, as part of what is known as a “convoy” using the desert road, a security precaution.</p>

<p><strong>Lodging:</strong> The beaches of Hurghada are lined with major hotels, including Marriott, Movenpick, and Sheraton. My favorite is the new Hilton, which is clean and relatively inexpensive during the winter (November-March). Check the Internet for hotel specials. I secured a room with a view of the Red Sea for $79 USD per night.</p>

<p>Major chain hotels can arrange what are known as ‘desert safaris’ for one person or a group. These are 4-wheel drive, one-day excursions into the Eastern Desert, including a stop at a Bedouin ‘village’ for tea, an explanation of their lifestyle and a camel ride. Prices vary from $50 to $200 per person.</p>

<p><strong>Reading:</strong></p>

<p>If you are serious about understanding the Bedouin culture, pick up a copy of “Bedouin Life in the Egyptian Wilderness” by Joseph J. Hobbs, University of Texas Press. This well-written book is available online from Amazon and Barnes and Nobles.</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>Historic Town Offers Much More Than Its Annual Decoy Festival</p>

<p>By Lester Picker</p>

<p>[This article originally appeared in <em>The Baltimore Sun</em>. I updated it for use in 2010.]</p>

<p><a href="http://blog.lesterpickerphoto.com/wp-content/uploads/2010/07/hdg-lighthouse-1-of-11.jpg"><img class="size-medium wp-image-396" title="lighthouse, Havre de Grace, MD, USA" src="http://blog.lesterpickerphoto.com/wp-content/uploads/2010/07/hdg-lighthouse-1-of-11-200x300.jpg" alt="" width="200" height="300"></a></p>

<p>Walking the tree-lined streets of historic Havre de Grace, Maryland is like stepping back in time. Leave the hustle and bustle of the city behind, skip the mad rush of suburban shopping malls, and spend an enjoyable weekend in this quaint town, tucked into the northeastern-most corner of Harford County.</p>

<p>Ideally located at the confluence of the Susquehanna River and the Chesapeake Bay, Havre de Grace played a prominent role during the Revolutionary War. In fact, during the First Congress in 1789, Havre de Grace missed by only one vote being named the capital of the fledgling United States. Called “Harbor of Grace” for its scenic beauty, it was considered indefensible from the all-powerful British Navy. That proved prophetic, when the British later bombarded Havre de Grace during the war of 1812, destroying much of the town.</p>

<p>Today, Havre de Grace is known for its quiet streets, thirty-plus antique shops, decoy shops, historic homes, and The Promenade, an environmentally friendly boardwalk that skirts the southern end of town and links the historic Concord Point Lighthouse with the bustling Tydings Memorial Park.</p>

<p>The town hosts tourist events throughout the year, including its famed Decoy, Wildlife Art and Sportsmen’s Festival, which spans the first full weekend in May (7-9). But, unlike gentrified Annapolis, Havre de Grace is still a working town, replete with marinas, crabbers and an active stone quarry that ships its wares by barges and tugboats to places as far away as Virginia.</p>

<p>There are so many ways to enjoy Havre de Grace, you might want to plan to spend an entire weekend. Since Havre de Grace is a walking (or bicycling) town, I suggest you arrive early and park in the municipal lot on the waterfront behind MacGregor’s Restaurant and adjacent to the Tidewater Grill, two of Havre de Grace’s most distinctive restaurants. Walk west to a tucked-away shop behind St. John Street and meet horologist John Stephens, proprietor of Stephens and Stephens. Horologist? In plain English, Stephens is a watch and clockmaker, and his small, but friendly waterfront shop is a tribute to his profession.</p>

<p>Walking south and west, en route to Havre de Grace’s main drag, Washington Street, you will pass the first of the nearly three dozen antique shops the town has to offer. Stop, if you must, but be warned. Havre de Grace’s antique shops are less pricey than many other areas in the state, so you will be sorely tempted to de-fatten your wallet.</p>

<p>Havre de Grace’s Washington Street is what Main Street America was perhaps fifty years ago, lined with trees, but today serving up an eclectic mix of stores that cater to the needs of both residents and tourists. Whatever else you do, set aside some time and wander through Joseph’s Department Store, a town fixture for generations. Its linoleum tiled floors and down-home sales staff will instantly whisk you back three generations.</p>

<p>Here are some of my favorite places to eat and visit, along with a smattering of family activities. But, the fun of Havre de Grace is in exploring and finding your own favorites.</p>

<p><strong>Places to Eat:</strong></p>

<p>For fresh ground and brewed coffee, you have two choices:  Java By the Bay, next door to Joseph’s Department Store and Jana’s Java, at the intersection of St. John’s Street, Washington Street and Green Street. Sit outdoors, sip your fragrant brew, and watch the crowds walk by.</p>

<p>My absolute favorite place for lunch and fine dining is Laurrapin Grill. Chef Bruce is a master with meats and seafood. The bar features an eclectic selection of beers and wines. The back dining room has a view of the water.</p>

<p>Two Italian restaurants within a few blocks of each other serve the tiny town. La Cucina is great for informal dining, while Chiaparelli’s offers upscale fine dining.</p>

<p>For a fun and informal lunch option, try The Ritz, on St. John Street, across from Lafayette Square.</p>

<p>Oh, I almost forgot. Some of the best chocolates in Maryland are made in Havre de Grace, at Bomboy’s, a family run business on Market Street. Skip lunch, but don’t miss Bomboy’s.</p>

<p><strong>Lodging:</strong></p>

<p>Havre de Grace may not have any hotels or chain motels, but that is one of the many endearing features of this town. Instead, try The Vandiver Inn (410-939-5200) or The Spencer Silver Mansion Bed &amp; Breakfast (410-939-1097), both of them elegant and historic homes. Both offer complimentary breakfasts for guests.</p>

<p><strong>Outdoor Activities:</strong></p>

<p>In and around Havre de Grace are myriad activities for a family, ranging from mild to strenuous. The most accessible for the entire family is a leisurely stroll along The Promenade. Park in the public area at Tydings Memorial Park at the town’s southern edge, at the east end of Union Avenue. Bring binoculars and walk along the wide boardwalk, stopping at the many convenient benches to admire the view. I’ve found the best time to be near dusk, when you may be lucky enough to see a wading Great Blue Heron or other aquatic birds. The Promenade winds along the shore and culminates in a marshy area, perfect for birding, at the foot of the Concord Point Lighthouse.</p>

<p>There are two bicycle shops in town. Chesapeake Cycle and Sport is located on the corner of Washington and Congress streets. Biller’s Bikes is located on the corner of Lodge Lane, Franklin and St. John streets. Havre de Grace is bicycle friendly. Spend a pleasant few hours peddling around the many coves and quiet streets of Havre de Grace. If you’re a fishing enthusiast, nothing beats the flats, where the Susquehanna River meets the Bay, for freshwater and striped bass.</p>

<p><a href="http://blog.lesterpickerphoto.com/wp-content/uploads/2010/07/susqstpk-1-of-1.jpg"><img class="size-medium wp-image-395" title="susqstpk 1 of 1" src="http://blog.lesterpickerphoto.com/wp-content/uploads/2010/07/susqstpk-1-of-1-199x300.jpg" alt="" width="199" height="300"></a></p>

<p>Hikers and bikers would also do well to visit Susquehanna State Park (410-557-7994), due west on Route 155, a few miles outside of Havre de Grace. There you can stroll or bicycle along river paths, view historic sites, fish and birdwatch. Bald eagles have staged an incredible comeback in this area, and draw nature enthusiasts all year long, especially in winter, where they congregate just below the Conowingo Dam. A large nature viewing area is open all year.</p>

<p>Golfers have a choice of some of Maryland’s finest courses, one of which – Pete Dye designed Bulle Rock (410-939-8887) - is rated one of the top golf courses in the nation. One of the many pleasures of teeing off well north of Baltimore is less crowded tee times. Try Wetlands Golf Club (410-273-7488) and Ruggles (410-278-4794), an old-style, forgiving course located on the Aberdeen Proving Grounds.</p>

<p>Havre de Grace is also known for its more than thirty antique shops, clustered here and there along Washington Street, Union Avenue, Market Street and on many of its side streets.</p>

<p><strong>Museums and Historic Sites:</strong></p>

<p>Havre de Grace is steeped in history. The Tourism office on Pennington Street between Union Avenue and Washington Street offers a free booklet that describes a self-guided walking/driving tour of the town, starting at the Concord Point Lighthouse (410-939-9040), built in 1827.</p>

<p>Be sure to visit the Decoy Museum (410-939-3739), just yards from the lighthouse. The Decoy Museum will give you a good feel for the art of decoy carving, as well as an appreciation of the Bay’s wildlife.</p>

<p>Still in town, and again a short walk from the lighthouse, try a pleasant afternoon or evening cruise on the Skipjack Martha Lewis (800-406-0766). The 32-passenger vessel offers ninety-minute environmental cruises for the whole family. It leaves from the foot of Congress Street.</p>

<p>The Steppingstone Farm Museum (410-939-2299) is located in Susquehanna State Park, and offers demonstrations of turn-of-the-century crafts, from weaving to blacksmithing. The Museum also sponsors several festivals which are wholesome family events, set against the beautiful backdrop of the Susquehanna River.</p>

<p><strong>How To Get There:</strong></p>

<p>From Baltimore, take I-95 North to Exit 89. Take Route 155 East toward Havre de Grace and follow the signs to the center of town. Travel time from downtown Baltimore is approximately 45 minutes.</p>

<p><strong>For More Information:</strong></p>

  <div class="entry-content"><h3>Photo Homework</h3>


<p>Here’s an idea for those of you wanting to increase your photography skills. Assign yourself some homework! Like in grade school penmanship lessons, I guarantee that with practice your skills will improve markedly.</p>

<p>Every so often, usually when I feel too long has gone by between photo shoots or assignments, I will give myself a photography assignment. I’ll pick a topic and force myself to shoot only on that topic for however long I feel like being out (or even inside).</p>

<p>So I thought I would regularly put an assignment in my blog and shoot it with you, discussing what it is I tried to do, as well as my take on successes and failures. However, these posts are really about you. My hope is that you’ll hand in your homework (forget the dog ate it!) and share it with me and our readers. I promise to comment if you’d like me to and I invite others to do the same.</p>

<h3>Portrait versus Landscape</h3>


<p>Okay, here’s the first assignment, what I call “Landscape-Portrait Flips.” Go outside to an environment that has strong vertical or horizontal lines and shoot the scene exactly the opposite. For example, most people shoot forest trees in portrait mode. Makes sense; tall trees = vertical shot. Instead, shoot all your vertical compositions in landscape mode. Go ahead, cut off those tree tops! The results can be unpredictable, but highly effective.</p>

<p><a href="http://blog.lesterpickerphoto.com/wp-content/uploads/2010/07/yukon_2009-09-07_1%C2%A9LesterPicker.jpg"><img class="alignleft size-medium wp-image-303" title="yukon_2009-09-07_1©LesterPicker" src="http://blog.lesterpickerphoto.com/wp-content/uploads/2010/07/yukon_2009-09-07_1%C2%A9LesterPicker-300x199.jpg" alt="" width="300" height="199"></a>Here’s what I came up with on a recent trip to the Yukon. I had a couple of days of travel ahead of me, so I had already made up my mind to focus on trees. We had stopped at a pull-out because there was a scenic lake. Several tourists were busily photographing the panoramic scene. I, too, grabbed a few shots. They seemed good on my LCD screen. But they were the same-old-same-old. I focused on my self-assignment and came up with this one. Shooting in landscape mode gave me the strong foreground elements that the sturdy tree trunks provide and I like the wisps of gold in the leaves. I wish I had more time at the scene, because I missed an opportunity to get stronger reflections in the water. I may go back into the image with post-processing and try to increase the contrast in the water reflections between the trees. I&#8217;d love to get your take on that. (<strong>Click on each image to see it full-size</strong>)</p>

<p>With this image, I liked the young saplings growing in a formerly clearcut area. In this case a horizontal shot just didn&#8217;t work for me. I liked the strong vertical lines. I also like the way the closer trees are exposed to the sun and draw your eye from right foreground to left background.</p>

<p><a href="http://blog.lesterpickerphoto.com/wp-content/uploads/2010/07/yukon2-_2009-08-27_2%C2%A9LesterPicker1.jpg"><img class="size-medium wp-image-319 alignnone" title="yukon2 _2009-08-27_2©LesterPicker" src="http://blog.lesterpickerphoto.com/wp-content/uploads/2010/07/yukon2-_2009-08-27_2%C2%A9LesterPicker1-199x300.jpg" alt="" width="199" height="300"></a></p>

<p style="text-align: center;"></p>


<p>Sunset comes late in the Yukon during the summer and early fall months. These shots were taken in September on Lake Labarge. Which one do you prefer? I think each has its merits, but I guess the vertical shot works better for me. I like the way the pier pulls my eye into the background.</p>

<p><a href="http://blog.lesterpickerphoto.com/wp-content/uploads/2010/07/yukonboat_2008-09-14_3%C2%A9LesterPicker1.jpg"><img class="size-medium wp-image-316 alignnone" title="yukonboat_2008-09-14_3©LesterPicker" src="http://blog.lesterpickerphoto.com/wp-content/uploads/2010/07/yukonboat_2008-09-14_3%C2%A9LesterPicker1-200x300.jpg" alt="" width="200" height="300"></a></p>

<p>In this final series of images, again of a formerly clearcut area, I initially shot the scene in portrait orientation, before deciding on landscape. I also converted the image to B&amp;W. I invite comments.</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><h1>British Virgin Islands Vacation</h1>


<p>by Lester Picker</p>

<p>[This article originally appeared in <em>The Baltimore Sun Travel</em> section. Some information may be dated, so please check beforehand.]</p>

<p>The epiphany arrived for me without fanfare somewhere around midnight the second day. Here I was, on my back, hands under my head, looking up at the night sky over the British Virgin Islands. The Milky Way clouds stood out almost as clearly as the stars and galaxies around it. A shooting star punctuated the scene every few minutes.</p>

<p>Two things made this scene stand out from any other vacation. First, I was with my five closest “guy” friends, all of them similarly laid back at the moment, each of us with a Cuban cigar in hand and some of us with a glass of choice Cabernet. Second, our conversation was accented by the gentle rocking of the 51-foot catamaran we had rented, now at anchor off Virgin Gorda, a to-die-for tropical beach.</p>

<p>And therein was the epiphany. This was no mere vacation. This was the ultimate, the penultimate, the Platinum Plus, the mother of all vacations. Except that mothers, of course, would not have been allowed. Nor daughters, or wives or sisters. We even fired the woman chef who came with the boat. This was a guy vacation; 51-feet of pure testosterone.</p>

<p>Single sex vacations are gaining in popularity, as friends seek to unwind from the pressures of everyday life without adding the stresses associated with more intimate romantic attachments. Women have been traveling together for decades, sharing adventurous experiences while banding together for safety reasons. Only recently have all-male vacations begun to catch on in popularity.</p>

<p>In the planning for months, the six of us, ages 45 to 52 and friends for more than a decade, had rented the catamaran, complete with captain, from The Catamaran Company, one of the many charter companies serving the British and American Virgin Islands. Our plan included leaving all work behind (except for my trip notes, of course), limiting ourselves to one suitcase each (we figured we could jump in the water if we needed to wash off a sweaty T-shirt), and bringing good music, mostly supplied by Randy, who is an accomplished musician and jazz pianist. Bill had sent the chef a list of dietary preferences weeks before, so she could provision the galley for us.</p>

<p>When we arrived in St. Thomas, we took a taxi to the ferry, which would get us to Tortola, the hub and largest of the British Virgin Islands. While the rest of us transferred our baggage to the ferry, one our group, the owner of a multi-million dollar international business in the D.C. area who shall remain anonymous, negotiated with the driver. That is the simplest explanation I can think of for why the $24 taxi fare cost us exactly $50. But, hey, I don’t negotiate international business deals every day, so what do I know? Anyway, the point is that the taxi transfer from airport to ferry should be $4.00 per person, including baggage. Caveat emptor.</p>

<p>The ferry itself is an interesting experience, as tourists share space with locals bringing all manner of goods from St. Thomas. The ferry winds itself between islands and, on the typical sunny day with the trade winds blowing, is an enjoyable trip. The rolling hills of the islands and their deep green color, provide a visual depth to the water and white sand beaches. Going through customs is an informal affair.</p>

<p>As we disembarked on Tortola, Captain Ron was there to ferry us by dinghy directly to Stars and Stripes, previously owned by Dennis Conner, and now in the tourist trade. The first rule of the boat was ‘no shoes,” which we gladly abided by for the remainder of the week.</p>

<p>Once on board, Cathy, our supposed-to-be chef, briefed us on the provisions she had stocked for us, how to use the galley, and where to find critical items tucked here and there in cupboards and under seat cushions. Since our plans forced her to find short-term room and board on the island, we had agreed to pay her a stipend for the week. She left to spend the week hanging around local beaches with friends. Someone has to do the tough jobs.</p>

<p>So, there we were, six guys scarred and wired from months of figuratively swimming with sharks, now ready to face the real ones lurking in the crystal clear waters (we didn’t see even one). Once our gear was stowed, we immediately set sail, the perfect afternoon weather buoying our moods. Lathered with sunscreen, a must on the water under tropical skies, we hit the deck to take in the wind and salt air.</p>

<p>By sunset, we reached Jost Van Dyke, a small island west of Tortola with remote white sand beaches, where the spectacular red sunset set the tone for the evening. Working together, our group somehow pulled together a dinner of diced tuna steaks with shrimp and scallops, sautéed with garlic and herbs, over a bed of wild rice. Fresh multi-grain bread, steamed asparagus and a choice of two elegant wines rounded out the main course.</p>

<p>On deck, Randi, an amateur astronomer, briefed us on the night sky, which appeared so close and bright we all felt suitably humbled. As the boat gently rocked to the rhythm of the waves, we divided the cabins. Four of us slept inside, and two of us slept under an awning on deck, the gentle, cool breezes lulling us to sleep in an instant.</p>

<p>The next morning dawned under a bright sun, as three of us started the day with a morning dip off the back of the boat - au natural. A pot of wine-dark coffee and a breakfast of eggs, bread and cereals revved up our engines. By nine, we were on the water, singly or in groups, engaged in whatever water pursuits were available. Joel, a fanatical wind surfer, gave Randi and me lessons. Bill tried his hand (and feet, and at times his entire body) water-skiing. Jay and John kayaked the island, exploring its marine caves and beaches.</p>

<p>After a light lunch, we spent the better part of the afternoon loafing, catching a nap, reading, or just talking one on one, in what turned out to be a daily pattern. At one point, I lay on the netting that separates the catamaran hulls as we skimmed the surface at eight knots. Looking down, I could see the bottom some thirty feet down, and occasional fish scurrying by. Above, billowing clouds dotted the skies. The thought occurred to me that perhaps life does get better as you get older. Here I was surrounded by friends I love, and with whom I could let down my guard. Life was definitely good.</p>

<p>After dinner of grilled salmon steaks, we settled down for an evening of high stakes poker, each of us anteing up five dollars for chips. By the time 11 PM rolled around, we were definitely ready for bed.</p>

<p>Captain Ron, 32-years old and an experienced sailor, was as easygoing as a person could be. He accommodated all our destination and activity requests, even making suggestions once he got to know us better.</p>

<p>On our third day, it occurred to us that we hadn’t touched land at all. We sailed to the Dogs, a series of rocky islands east of Tortola, where we anchored and spent a wondrous morning snorkeling in and around the reefs. At West Dog we found a cave carved into the rocks and our entire group snorkeled in and out. Long shafts of sunlight flickered down to the depths of the cave and colorful tropical fish darted in and out, their iridescent colors flashing on and off as they made their appearances.</p>

<p>We were so taken by the experience, at one point we all swam as far as we could into a particularly long cave and then spontaneously gathered in a circle in the water and let out a long holler. Definitely a guy thing.</p>

<p><a href="http://blog.lesterpickerphoto.com/wp-content/uploads/2010/07/BVI-virgin-gorda_2008-08-27_5%C2%A9LesterPicker.jpg"><img class="size-medium wp-image-341" title="Virgin Gorda, Tortola, BVI" src="http://blog.lesterpickerphoto.com/wp-content/uploads/2010/07/BVI-virgin-gorda_2008-08-27_5%C2%A9LesterPicker-199x300.jpg" alt="" width="199" height="300"></a></p>

<p>That afternoon we made a short stop for supplies at the Virgin Gorda Yacht Harbour, our first landfall. The Yacht Harbour caters to the boating community, with a full-services marina, marine supply store, a dive shop, a quaint bar and restaurant, and a few tourist shops. Virgin Gorda itself is an 8.5 square mile, rambling island due east of Tortola, boasting towns, long stretches of white sand beaches and, for hikers and nature lovers, Gorda Peak National Park. The Park is a favorite for birders, with chances good for spotting some of the more than 200 species of Virgin Island birds. Christopher Columbus named it The Fat Virgin because of its unusual shape; fat in the middle with elongated spurs of land running east and west.</p>

<p>On the fourth day, we did a little snorkeling from the boat in the morning, then sailed for the rest of the day, listening to great jazz en route, talking and relaxing on the nets between the hulls. We were headed for the reefs of Anegada, where we planned to do some heavy snorkeling the following day.</p>

<p>Anegada is a quaint island – actually a coral atoll- only eleven miles long, very narrow, and flat as a pancake, which caters to windsurfers and divers. It offers tourists simple homelike cottages and, for the more adventurous two campgrounds. For dinner, we feasted on lobster at Neptune’s Treasure, a quirky, come-as-you-are seafood restaurant on the south side of the island. The restaurant even catered to those of our group who were vegetarian, with heaping plates of lightly steamed vegetables, potatoes and angel hair pasta. Due to the light Labor Day crowds, the restaurant was like a scene from Casablanca, with people milling about, some smoking, and lots of laughing.</p>

<p>In a trip of highlights, the next major moment came the following day, when we spent a memorable four hours snorkeling the reefs off Loblolly Beach on the windward side of Anegada. We waded into the warm water from the beach, where the reefs literally reach out to just 18 inches below the surface. Just snorkeling you can swim among schools of fish and spend hours taking in the beauty of the varied coral formations. If you are a SCUBA enthusiast, the wrecks which dot the coral reefs are a major attraction for both fish and divers. Gear is available for modest rental fees from one of many shops that dot the islands. Dive boat charters, including night dives, are available for under $100 for a two-tank trip. Basic and advanced instruction is also available. Boats can accommodate families with one diver and the rest snorkelers or observers.</p>

<p>That afternoon, our final one on board the Stars and Stripes, we sailed back to Tortola, Spanish for Turtle Dove, gorging ourselves on fresh island fruits, especially sweet, ripe pineapples, thoughtfully and amply stocked by our ex-chef. Since the boat boasts a charcoal grill on the rear deck, we grilled huge steaks of Mahi-Mahi, with angel hair pasta and homemade sauce.</p>

<p>After dark, we sat around comparing highlights of the trip, before heading into Cane Garden Bay on the northwest side of Tortola to taste some local rum along the many bars that line the beaches. A delightful steel calypso band serenaded the guests to a lively island beat. After living on a boat for five days, we all felt as if the bar itself was swaying.</p>

<p>On our last morning, we woke early, packed our gear and sailed to the south side of the island to pick up our ferry back to St. Thomas. Leaving Stars and Stripes wasn’t easy, after an idyllic vacation of sun, sea and sail. But, parting was made easier by the transition on St. Thomas, with its fine restaurants, pretty side alleys and cobblestone streets, packed with stores catering to the tourist trade. Tiny cafes serving strong Jamaican coffee are interspersed with boutiques selling handmade clothing and jewelry. If you are going to the British Virgin Islands, plan to spend at least half a day touring St. Thomas, its American cousin.</p>

<p><strong>Sidebar</strong></p>

<p>Virgin Island charter boats typically are rented to couples either without captain (known as a bare boat charter) or with. Increasingly, though, groups of all men or women friends will splurge. However, if you’re in a serious relationship with a member of the opposite sex, figure on the trip costing double. Your relationship will never survive unless your significant other gets his or her chance to show off their ideal vacation pictures. Sort of an adult version of I’ll show you mine if you show me yours.</p>

<p>Boats come equipped with everything for a perfect vacation on the water, from windsurfers to water-skis. The boat is also equipped with a VCR, a video library, stereo with CD player, and many other comforts of home. Charter companies will also entertain reasonable requests for special items or activities, such as SCUBA classes or special dietary preferences. Since charter boats cater to the business crowd, they all have marine mobile telephones on board.</p>

<p>The Catamaran Company (1-800-262-0308: http://<a href="http://www.catamaranco.com/">www.catamaranco.com</a>/) offers bare boats ranging from 37 to 48 feet, each with three to 5 cabins. Crewed boats range from 48-65 feet. Appointments are luxurious (cherry wood interiors, showers in each cabin, electric heads) and every watery whim one could want is provided in the fee. Since our charter was off-season and only five full days, each of us ended up paying only $1,400.</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><h3>Sun City, South Africa</h3>


<p>by Lester Picker</p>

<p>[This article originally appeared in The Baltimore Sun Travel section. Some information may be dated, so always check beforehand.]</p>

<p><a href="http://blog.lesterpickerphoto.com/wp-content/uploads/2010/07/sun-city-SA_2006-10-29_7%C2%A9LesterPicker.jpg"><img class="size-medium wp-image-346" title="sun city, SA_2006-10-29_7©LesterPicker" src="http://blog.lesterpickerphoto.com/wp-content/uploads/2010/07/sun-city-SA_2006-10-29_7%C2%A9LesterPicker-204x300.jpg" alt="" width="204" height="300"></a></p>

<p>Huddling against the cold in the June pre-dawn darkness in Pilanesberg National Park, South Africa, nothing could have prepared me for the sights and sounds that were ever so slowly, magically inching their way over the horizon.</p>

<p>As our hot air balloon filled in noisy bursts, we could see the faint outline of a herd of wildebeests grazing unperturbed all around us. Our guide, Andrew, kept us herded together, too, a high-powered rifle at his side. A pair of lions was seen the day before hunting in this section of the park and he was taking no chances.</p>

<p>A few minutes later we were off. The huge balloon rose in tandem with the sun, the horizon painted in muted shades of red and orange, as if half a world away the earth was on fire. With the daylight, birds took to the air around and below us, baboons chattered, and the joyous noises of Africa’s diverse wildlife alternated with the man-made blasts of propane keeping us aloft.</p>

<p>For the next two hours we hovered over the huge game preserve, which sits inside an extinct volcanic alkaline crater, one of only three in the world. As the sun heated the land, giving us added buoyancy, we watched rhinoceros feed on knee-high grasses, and elephants tug leaves from trees with their trunks. Hippopotamuses rested one on top of another in the shallow lakes, and brown and white springboks grazed at the ecotone between grassland and brush. Descending over a lake, a lone sacred ibis waded patiently at the edge of a lake hunting for fish. Most amazing of all was that throughout the balloon ride we were never out of view of the spires of The Palace of the Lost City at Sun City, South Africa, the continent’s premier family resort.</p>

<p>Describing Sun City is a challenge. On the surface it is a glitzy $300 million dollar complex of four resorts, including the upscale Palace of the Lost City, the more moderate Cascades, the affordable Sun City Hotel and the family-friendly Cabanas. Strategically placed within its currently developed 150 acres are two Gary Player designed, 18-hole golf courses, one of them with the now infamous 40-crocodile water hazard on the 13th hole. There is also an entertainment complex which houses a 6,000-seat theater featuring world-class entertainers, along with two casinos, cinemas showing first-run attractions, retail shopping, restaurants, convention facilities and a world-class video arcade for the kids. Just a short walk from the entertainment complex is Waterworld, boasting machines generating waves you can surf on and a series of water slides that include a three-story monster you’re guaranteed to never forget.  After you discover the dozens of gourmet restaurants and fast-food facilities in Sun City, you’ll need to make use of its state-of-the-art fitness facility.</p>

<p>The dreamchild of the controversial entrepreneur Sol Kerzner, the founder of Sun International Resorts, Sun City is without a doubt his crowning achievement, a destination so well conceived, and even more brilliantly executed, I found myself time and again marveling at its sheer magnificence. Dig below your initial impressions, and you will find a level of detail and attention to service that is remarkable.</p>

<p>Sun City is located two hours northwest of Johannesburg, in South Africa’s North West Province. The resort is partially surrounded by Pilanesberg National Park, a 14,000 acre national preserve accessible by four wheel drive vehicles driven by trained guides and naturalists. Sun City is an idyllic destination for families seeking a once-in-a-lifetime adventure. In fact, short of Disney World, I can’t imagine a place more attuned to the needs of families.</p>

<p><a href="http://blog.lesterpickerphoto.com/wp-content/uploads/2010/07/sun-city-SA_2006-10-29_5%C2%A9LesterPicker.jpg"><img class="alignleft size-medium wp-image-348" title="sun city, SA_2006-10-29_5©LesterPicker" src="http://blog.lesterpickerphoto.com/wp-content/uploads/2010/07/sun-city-SA_2006-10-29_5%C2%A9LesterPicker-300x202.jpg" alt="" width="300" height="202"></a>Arriving at The Palace of the Lost City after a 14-hour flight and a two-hour drive from Johannesburg, I expected to have little patience for its pretensions, which include a 61-acre man-made tropical rain forest surrounding the $175 million Palace. Instead, I was stunned by its immaculately manicured grounds, the fine arts sculptures - all by South African artists - which adorn its many nooks and crannies, and the management’s unswerving commitment to environmentally friendly practices. The forest’s 1.6 million plants, and both golf courses, are watered by an automated, recycled water system, bolstered by composted soil from Sun City’s operations. Shades of Jurassic Park, Kerzner even erected an electric fence, to the tune of $3 million, to protect guests from the Pilanesberg wildlife - and vice versa as a park ranger pointedly mentioned, with a wink.</p>

<p>But, it is in the little touches that Sun City excels, from the high quality service throughout the resort, to the hand-carved timber doors and beds that lavishly decorate each of the 338 rooms in The Palace, or the luxurious robes that are meticulously arranged on your bed every night, cuddling a basket of assorted Godiva chocolates. Entering The Palace’s lobby, one is immediately struck by Kerzner’s commitment to excellence. Italian marble floors surround 300,000 hand-painted mosaic tiles in the form of native South African wildlife. The vaulted, domed ceiling in the lobby features a hand-painted fresco of South African natural scenes. Italian crystal chandeliers grace the elegant open-style Crystal Court restaurant, just off the lobby.</p>

<p><a href="http://blog.lesterpickerphoto.com/wp-content/uploads/2010/07/sun-city-SA_2006-10-29_6%C2%A9LesterPicker.jpg"><img class="alignright size-medium wp-image-349" title="sun city, SA_2006-10-29_6©LesterPicker" src="http://blog.lesterpickerphoto.com/wp-content/uploads/2010/07/sun-city-SA_2006-10-29_6%C2%A9LesterPicker-201x300.jpg" alt="" width="201" height="300"></a>At night, The Palace is lit by the glow of hundreds of natural gas torches, which highlight it’s stone and precast cement architecture and lend an absolutely magical and mysterious aura. In the center of one of its outdoor courtyards stands a life-size bronze statue of the legendary Shawu, an enormous bull elephant that is an integral part of South Africa’s wild heritage. Five-star restaurants and elegant bars are sprinkled throughout the cavernous Palace.</p>

<p>The Palace’s water attractions place it in a category of one, arguably surpassed only by another Sun International property, Atlantis in the Bahamas, although that property has an entirely different ambiance. Everywhere guests go at the Palace, they are greeted by waterfalls, shallow pools with wild wading birds, swimming pools, and the ever popular Valley of the Waves, which generates mechanical waves more active guests can surf on. The man-made tropical forest even has babbling brooks winding through its canopied structure.</p>

<p>Despite its many attractions, The Palace’s ambiance is restrained, quiet and elegant. If gambling is in your plans, you’ll have to take the complimentary shuttle bus or take a leisurely walk to the casinos.</p>

<p>If The Palace is too rich for your taste, sample any of the other three Sun City hotels on the property, all of which border a man-made lake that offers everything from boating to parasailing, water-skiing to windsurfing. Central to the hotels is a state-of-the-art child care facility, called Camp Kwena, which is the local Tswana tribe name for crocodile. But not to worry. The only animals the children will see at Camp Kwena are contained in a wonderful petting zoo that campers access daily with their counselors. A few steps from the zoo there is a marvelous aviary, where rare African birds flit from branch to branch. There are also huge play forts and castles, trampolines and even an electric car track for younger campers, complete with stop signs and crosswalks. All staff are trained and licensed and offer a wide range of activities for children of all ages. Parents may drop off children in the morning and pick them up in the evening. Babysitting is available in the evenings.</p>

<p>Next in line in order of palatial amenities is the 242-room Cascades Hotel, the smallest in Sun City, featuring a theme of cascading water and lush tropical gardens, both inside and out. Sit in the outdoor portion of the Peninsula restaurant and enjoy views of the gardens, lake and the Gary Player Golf Course. The family will be entertained by peacocks walking free, strutting their stuff among the tables, or watch flamingoes wading in the lake. Send the kids out to play in the garden while waiting for your meal, and you can sip drinks to the refreshing sounds of streams and waterfalls that meander through the restaurant area.</p>

<p>The gardens, which draw guests from the other three hotels, are constantly being transformed based on people’s preferences and the natural ecology of South Africa. Gardeners record guests preferred walkways getting from the Cascades to other attractions, then build landscaped, pebbled garden paths to conform. You can wander the vividly colorful azalea gardens, or grab a peaceful nap in one of the many hammocks that dot a circle of fig trees. In some areas, vegetation has been intentionally thinned to provide birders with unobstructed views of songbirds that flitter among the hanging orchids.</p>

<p>Rooms at the Cascades are tastefully appointed, much more in line with an upscale American hotel than is true in the opulent Palace. True to form, the management brought in one of the world’s top hotel décor designers, Trisha Wilson of Dallas, to carry the garden theme into each and every room. Even the bedspreads are quilted with tropical flowers and foliage.</p>

<p>If your blood runs hot and you crave excitement, try the even more affordable Sun City Hotel, with its cavernous gambling casino and nonstop night life. The Sun City Hotel is connected to the Entertainment Center, with its first-run movie theater and video arcade, providing non-stop entertainment for every family member. Be careful, though. The frenetic pace may simply be too over-stimulating for very young children.</p>

<p>The Entertainment Center includes several international fast-food restaurants, so even if your family lodges in one of the other hotels in Sun City, missing older children are sure to be found here. There is a range of restaurants, from French cuisine to Moroccan, with the Raffles Supper Club offering dinner and dancing. If you can, enjoy breakfast on the Terrace, with its views of the surrounding hills of Pilanesberg.</p>

<p>Walk out of the back door of the Sun City Hotel and you are on the Bridge of Time, which blasts guests with a simulated volcano every thirty minutes. The scene draws scads of kids to its regular eruptions, with the bridge itself shaking convincingly. From there, it’s just a stone’s throw to the water attractions at The Valley of the Waves.</p>

<p>A bargain even by American standards, the Cabanas, the fourth lodging property, offers the same idyllic African scenery, and full access to Sun City’s casinos and amenities, as that of its more luxurious sisters. Family-style room are clean, but modestly furnished in what approaches motel-style accommodations. However, the setting for families is ideal, with Camp Kwena no more than a few hundred feet away, and a panoramic view of the lake thrown in for good measure. A short walk away are tennis and squash courts, ten pin bowling, and volley ball, as well as a fully equipped health spa A terrace lounge, as well as two restaurants, round out the amenities offered at the Cabanas. Special package offers make the Cabanas an ideal way to visit South Africa, its wonderful people and wildlife, without breaking the bank.</p>

<p>Cape Town deservedly draws the bulk of South African tourists. However, travelers there would be well advised to place Sun City on their itineraries. One of the very fortunate distractions on the long flight to South Africa is the chance to fly South African Airways, a top-rated airline with excellent food and service, including a list of very fine South African wines.</p>

<p><strong>Sun City Direct Line</strong>: (800) 990-8299.</p>

<p><strong>South African Airways</strong>: (800) 722-9675.</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>The Galapagos: Enchanted Islands</p>

<p>by Lester Picker</p>

<p>[This article originally appeared in <em>The Baltimore Sun </em>Travel section. Some information may be dated, so always check beforehand.]</p>

<p>Magical is the most overused word when writing about the Galapagos, those magical islands off the coast of Ecuador. Oops! Sorry, but there really is something about these islands that gets under your skin. One visit and you’re hooked. Two visits morphs you into a passionate advocate.</p>

<p>On my last visit I tried to figure out just what is so alluring about the Galapagos. Compared to the lush majesty of the Hawaiian Islands they rank a distant second. They can’t boast four-diamond restaurants or five-star hotels and there is not a shopping mega-mall or multiplex anywhere.</p>

<p><a href="http://blog.lesterpickerphoto.com/wp-content/uploads/2010/07/galapagos_2007-12-12_10%C2%A9LesterPicker.jpg"><img class="alignleft size-medium wp-image-353" title="galapagos_2007-12-12_10©LesterPicker" src="http://blog.lesterpickerphoto.com/wp-content/uploads/2010/07/galapagos_2007-12-12_10%C2%A9LesterPicker-300x200.jpg" alt="" width="300" height="200"></a>What does make them so special is that they are situated directly on the Pacific equator. Deep-ocean currents well up all around them, bringing tons of nutrients to support plankton, fish, sea lions, humpback whales, sea birds, and iguanas. Unfortunately, the very wildlife that makes the Galapagos so attractive may be its undoing. Today more than 148,000 visitors flock to the islands, an increase of more than 87,000 since 2000 alone.</p>

<p>This influx of tourists has been responsible for a corresponding spike in residents, both legal and illegal, that cater to the tourist trade.  The environmental stresses associated with that level of human activity – think housing, roads, pollution - has brought this fragile ecosystem to imminent crisis, with UNESCO recently adding the archipelago to its danger list. When locally owned and run boats handled all tourism, there were fewer problems. But the advent of mega-ships, each unloading hundreds of tourists at a time has exacerbated the environmental damage. A side effect of the overpopulation is that marine stocks are being over-fished, prompting restrictive government regulations. In February, 2008, 53 sea lions were slaughtered, most likely by local fishermen upset with those new measures.</p>

<p><a href="http://blog.lesterpickerphoto.com/wp-content/uploads/2010/07/galapagos_2006-11-14_11%C2%A9LesterPicker.jpg"><img class="size-medium wp-image-354" title="marine iguanas, Galapagos" src="http://blog.lesterpickerphoto.com/wp-content/uploads/2010/07/galapagos_2006-11-14_11%C2%A9LesterPicker-300x176.jpg" alt="" width="300" height="176"></a></p>

<p>Concerns over the fate of the Galapagos have prompted the tourism industry to band together with Galapagos National Park administrators and scientists to develop sustainable eco-tourism standards. It is now possible to be an eco-conscious Galapagos tourist.</p>

<p>First, and most importantly, choose a locally owned and operated smaller boat, one that holds 10-30 tourists, with 20 being the ideal number. They have far less impact on the environment and can place you on island locations that the larger ships simply cannot access.</p>

<p>Probably the oldest company serving the Galapagos is the venerable Metropolitan Touring (www.metropolitan-touring.com). Metropolitan operates a huge recycling center that converts all of its plastic waste to pavers that are used in street construction in Puerto Aroyo, the main port of the Galapagos. They also recycle paper and donate money for environmental conservation through their private foundation.</p>

<p>The most eco-conscious tour company is locally-owned-and-operated Ecoventura (www.ecoventura.com), operating a fleet of three boats that each accommodates 20 people. The accommodations are rustic and the food good and plentiful, not gourmet, but the guides are terrific and you will always be in an excursion group of no more than ten, which in itself minimizes the effect on wildlife. Ecoventura has been cited repeatedly for its forward-thinking environmental agenda that includes a ten-point program to reduce its environmental impact. In fact, Ecoventura recently entered into a partnership with the World Wildlife Fund that places it on the forefront of environmental stewardship.</p>

<p><a href="http://blog.lesterpickerphoto.com/wp-content/uploads/2010/07/galapagos_2007-12-14_8%C2%A9LesterPicker.jpg"><img class="size-medium wp-image-356" title="galapagos_2007-12-14_8©LesterPicker" src="http://blog.lesterpickerphoto.com/wp-content/uploads/2010/07/galapagos_2007-12-14_8%C2%A9LesterPicker-300x200.jpg" alt="" width="300" height="200"></a></p>

<p>These ecological concerns, coupled with more stringent protective regulations, make it incumbent on the tourist to be sure they get what they expect during their visit. For example, as of 2008 the number of tour boats has been capped at 85. But, certain islands or sites are available ONLY to boats carrying 20 or fewer passengers. In addition, there are regulations pending that may limit each tour boat to a prescribed two-week rotation, so that environmental impact can be closely monitored. The best advice is to read up on the Galapagos and make a wildlife wish list, then correspond with your operator to be sure you will see those animals before putting down a deposit. But act fast, because with the number of boats capped so are the number of visitors and reservations are often made a year or more in advance.</p>

<p>Since the Galapagos archipelago is a living laboratory, regulations change, although usually with some warning. For example, Fernandina Island is currently off limits to snorkeling due to the stresses placed on sea turtles and other wildlife. Parts of Isabella Island are off limits until the introduced goat problem is solved and endemic plants recover. That might be several years.</p>

<p>There is one non-ecological issue that travelers to the Galapagos should be aware of. Recently, tour operators have become increasingly concerned about liability issues</p>

<p>As a result, some are requiring tourists to sign what could only be considered onerous release forms. The insane thing is that these are not mailed in advance. The first you will see of it is when you land in the Galapagos, just minutes before boarding your boat. I have seen some pretty irate tourists facing a draconian choice of signing or going home.  My recommendation is that you demand to see any releases before putting down your deposit.</p>

<p>Once you visit the Galapagos, you will understand why I say that any hassles you might have getting there fade quickly into background noise. You’ll carry the pungent smell of sea lions in your memory bank for a lifetime. Ditto the sights of a baby albatross spreading its wings, or hundreds of marine iguanas basking in the sun, or the sounds and sites of thousands of frigate birds nesting. Oh, did I say that these islands are just magical?</p>

<p><strong>Ten Things to Know Before You Go</strong></p>

<ol>
<li>The      Galapagos archipelago consist of 19 islands, directly on the equator, some      650 miles off the coast of Ecuador, covering an area of nearly 20,000      square miles of ocean.</li>
    <li>Ecuador      uses the American dollar as its currency, making it an easy travel country      for Americans. And, speaking of currency (well, sort of), Ecuador uses      standard 110 volt current, the same as the U.S.A.</li>
    <li>Be      sure every question you have about your itinerary and ship is answered      before you pay your deposit. Know which wildlife you want to see and which      islands you want to visit and be certain that your tour operator will      accommodate those wish lists on your specified dates.</li>
    <li>Be      aware that every plane is sprayed with 2% D-Phenothin (an insecticide)      before landing in the Galapagos. That’s good for the Galapagos wildlife,      not so good for you. Bring along a bandana, disposable breathing mask or      breathing filter to wear when spraying begins.</li>
    <li>Guides      are licensed by the Galapagos National Park in a rigorous process. They      are experts in every sense of the word and usually good with people.      However, remember that their first priority is to protect the fragile      ecology of the islands. Therefore always stay with your group, follow      directions carefully and do not wander off prescribed paths. Be forewarned      that paths are often slippery, very rocky and are often studded with      razor-sharp lava.</li>
    <li>You      will never get closer to exotic wildlife than you will in the Galapagos.      However, you are not allowed to touch any of the wildlife there. By      abiding by these regulations you will reduce stress and the transmission      of disease to wildlife.</li>
    <li>Delicate      as it is to mention, one of the biggest problems reported by Galapagos      guides are bratty children whose parents cannot bear to tell them “no.” I      have seen unruly children chasing nesting albatrosses and kicking      defenseless marine iguanas. Look at your impending Galapagos excursion as      an unprecedented opportunity to learn to set limits for your children. If      your kids are already perfect, please accept my apologies.</li>
    <li>Most      Galapagos tour companies will arrange side trips to the Amazon and to the      Otavalo highlands region. Take advantage of these once-in-a-lifetime      experiences. I would recommend Sacha Lodge in the Amazon (<a href="http://www.sachalodge.com">www.sachalodge.com</a>). For an      over-the-top, upscale, and moderately priced experience in the indigenous      Otavalo region, attractive to shoppers as well as hikers, try the      five-star La Mirage Garden Hotel &amp; Spa, which is a Relais &amp;      Chateaux property in Cotacachi-Imbabura (<a href="http://www.mirage.com.ec">www.mirage.com.ec</a>)      .</li>
    <li>Bring      a good camera and at least twice as many memory cards as you think you      will use.</li>
    <li>Take      advantage of snorkeling opportunities, even if you are a timid swimmer.      Sea lions dart around you, sea turtles glide effortlessly below you, and      marine iguanas will swim right by you en route to their seaweed grazing      beds down deep. And that’s in addition to schools of colorful fish and      corals.  Magical, really!</li>

  <div class="entry-content"><p><strong>Winter Fun in Boulder, Colorado</strong></p>

<p>by Lester Picker</p>

<p>[This article originally appeared in <em>Better Homes &amp; Gardens. </em>Some material may be dated. Please check beforehand.]</p>

<p><em>“This valley is so beautiful that people seeing it will never be happy anywhere else and will always return.”</em></p>

<ul>
<li>Arapaho Chief Niwot’s ‘curse’</li>
</ul>


<p>Sitting at the foot of Colorado’s imposing Front Range mountains, the scenery around Boulder is nothing less than spectacular.  Streets radiate from the town center and quickly turn into valleys, gorges and peaks of incredible beauty.  From any point in town you can see the Flatiron Mountains dominating the scenery with their imposing presence.</p>

<p>Despite its reputation as a training ground for Olympic hopefuls, Boulder is a family mecca for winter recreation. With more than 300 sunny days a year, mild winter temperatures, and a city psyche geared toward active pursuits, Boulder is the perfect winter get-away destination.</p>

<p><strong><em>Skiing</em></strong></p>

<p>Whether your preference is cross-country, downhill or snowboarding, Boulder has ten ski resorts within a two drive. Thirty minutes from downtown is the Eldora Mountain resort, boasting 43 trails for beginners through advanced, and a complete child care facility for newborns to pre-teens. Views of the Continental Divide from Eldora Mountain are magical. Snowboarders are welcome.</p>

<p>Eldora’s Nordic Center is one of the best in Colorado, with 45 kilometers of cross-country trails, instruction, rentals, ladies days, and even a mountain cabin which is available for rental.</p>

<p><strong><em>Snowshoeing and Ice-skating</em></strong></p>

<p>For a special family treat, take a scenic 20-mile drive through mountain passes and gorges, to Gold Lake Mountain Resort in the nearby old mining town of Ward. Perched on the shores of pristine Gold Lake, the resort is an environmentally friendly facility with spectacular views and every amenity possible.  Enjoy ice-skating on the lake, or hiking one of the many snowshoeing trails.  Equipment rentals are free for guests.</p>

<p>If you’re a cross-country enthusiast, take off from Gold Lake Mountain Resort and enjoy the Brainard Lake trails, just across the road. At 11,000 feet, the trails weave through the forest and along the shore, with opportunities to stop at cabins run by the Colorado Mountain Club for coffee and hot chocolate.  Then, be sure to come back and dine at Gold Lake’s gourmet restaurant, Alice’s.  After dinner, relax in their indoor or outdoor hot tubs, or indulge in a full-body massage offered by professional masseuses.</p>

<p>In Boulder itself, ice-skating and sledding are available in Scott Carpenter Park.</p>

<p><strong><em>Biking, Hiking and Horseback Riding</em></strong></p>

<p>The Boulder Creek Trail is one of the finest examples of urban recreation parks in the country.  Meandering for eleven miles, the trail is plowed during winter to allow for family biking, running or just plain ambling.  Starting in town, the creek winds through breathtaking mountain passes and gorges.  True to the Boulder spirit, the trail is dotted with sculptures and roadway underpasses are painted with murals by local artists.  Bicycle rentals are available at many locations in town.</p>

<p>Since sixty-degree winter days are common, why not plan a session of horseback riding through pastures and fields with open vistas of Boulder’s Front Range?  Boulder ranches are family-friendly.  Dress warmly and stash a jug of hot chocolate in the saddlebags.</p>

<p><strong><em>Rainy Day Activities</em></strong></p>

<p>Whether its rain or moody children, taking an off-day in Boulder can be a wonderful opportunity to recharge the family batteries.  Try some of these out-of-the-ordinary activities.</p>

<p>The <strong>Butterfly Pavilion and Insect Center</strong> is located midway between Boulder and Denver. It is a first-class science attraction, where the family can seek shelter from rain or cold amidst a tropical rain forest where butterflies flutter everywhere.  Children will delight when they land on their hands or heads.</p>

<p>Boulder is also the home to <strong>Celestial Seasonings Tea company</strong>, where a pleasant morning or afternoon can be spent touring the factory, sampling dozens of different teas, and viewing art exhibits. But, don’t miss the Mint Room, where natural mints for teas are stored.  It’s guaranteed to be an unforgettable experience.</p>

<p><a href="http://blog.lesterpickerphoto.com/wp-content/uploads/2010/07/images-1.jpeg"><img class="size-full wp-image-331" title="images-1" src="http://blog.lesterpickerphoto.com/wp-content/uploads/2010/07/images-1.jpeg" alt="" width="168" height="212"></a></p>

<p>And, don’t forget the <strong>Boulder Public Library</strong> when planning the day’s events.  With a full slate of films, lectures, discussion groups, children’s storytime, concerts and young adult activities, the library is a family’s best friend.  Best of all, the main library hosts a gift shop and espresso bar in an inviting open architecture that soothes the soul.</p>

<p><strong><em>Lodging</em></strong></p>

<p>For a carefree vacation, try the Gold Lake Mountain Resort, where the entire family will be alternately energized and pampered.  Every winter activity, from sledding and ice-skating to cross-country skiing and snowshoeing are available on the property.  Each cabin is decorated in a funky, one-of-a-kind style.</p>

<p>In Boulder itself, try the Alps Boulder Canyon Inn, with its beautifully appointed Victorian rooms, each with a fireplace. The charming Inn, a former stagecoach stop and bordello, boasts walk-in fireplaces and lounge areas downstairs.</p>

<p>The Boulderado Hotel is Boulder’s most famous resting place, having hosted the likes of Teddy Roosevelt, Douglas Fairbanks, Bat Masterson, Robert Frost and Helen Keller.  Its old West charm is complemented by a modern wing which blends comfortably into its architecture.</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>The Inns of Boulder and Colorado Springs</p>

<p>by Lester Picker</p>

<p><em>[Please note: This article originally appeared in a consumer magazine. Information in this article may be dated. Always check before making reservations or traveling.]</em></p>

<p><strong>Boulder</strong></p>

<h2>The Alps Boulder Canyon Inn</h2>


<p>From the quaint painted porch of <em>The Alps Boulder Canyon Inn</em>, comfortably nestled in the midst of majestic Boulder Canyon in Colorado’s scenic Front Range mountains, one can be excused for smiling at Chief Niwot’s ‘curse.’ Sipping fresh-squeezed lemonade, prepared each quiet summer’s afternoon by innkeepers Jeanine and John Vanderhart, while resting peacefully on cushioned white wicker furniture, the ambience is nothing less than spectacular. You look across the canyon at the shear wall of the mountain, with its tall pine trees and exposed rock surfaces. As the sun sets, the magical sounds of rushing Boulder creek fill the night air.</p>

<p>Unlike their East-coast cousins, western Inns often have the luxury of space – lots if it. The Alps Boulder Canyon Inn is no exception, with its grand entranceway and vaulted foyer which showcases its walk-through stone fireplace, trophy elk head mounted on the second floor ceiling and huge bear rug draped over the third floor interior balcony.</p>

<p>The Alps’ twelve meticulously appointed guest rooms belie its shaded past. Once upon a time it was a stagecoach stop and bordello, catering to the hard-rock, and often hard-luck miners on their way to points north. But, four years ago, the Vanderharts began lovingly restoring the Inn, refining the style of the great lodges and camps of the Northwoods to an art form.</p>

<p>John Vanderhart has labored lovingly doing the stonework on the property, laying out meandering native flagstone pathways and delightful water gardens with outdoor tables so guests can enjoy the plantings with their morning coffee. Jeanine has delighted in refurbishing all guest rooms with Victorian furnishings and fireplaces. Each of the spacious rooms features a sitting area and a private bath with either a claw foot tub or double Jacuzzi tub and shower. Family heirlooms and period antiques welcome guests.</p>

<p>Breakfasts, featuring home-made Belgian waffles, are personally served by Jeanine and her staff in the huge dining room, decorated with rustic wood furniture. The mossrock fireplace dominates the room, adding a warmth during chill summer evenings or cold winter days. SK and Sid, mother and son Persian cats, often bask in front of the fireplace on their namesake Persian rugs, purring contentedly as guests pet them. Guests, snug in the warmly invitingly sofa or armchairs, have been known to purr contentedly over a glass of port, too.</p>

<p>The Alps Boulder Canyon Inn, 38619 Boulder Canyon Drive, Boulder, CO 80302; 800/414-ALPS. Twelve units, all w/private baths. Full gourmet American and buffet breakfasts, afternoon tea and evening desserts included. Cancellation policy. No smoking, no pets. All major credit cards.</p>

<h2>Earl House</h2>


<p>Two miles down Canyon Drive, in downtown Boulder, the streets that radiate from the town center quickly turn into valleys, gorges and peaks of incredible beauty. From nearly any point in town you can see the Flatiron Mountains dominating the scenery with their imposing presence. And, in the midst of the art, culture and beauty that is Boulder sits the majestic <em>Earl House Historic Inn</em>.</p>

<p><a href="http://blog.lesterpickerphoto.com/wp-content/uploads/2010/07/earlext.jpg"><img class="size-full wp-image-295" title="earlext" src="http://blog.lesterpickerphoto.com/wp-content/uploads/2010/07/earlext.jpg" alt="" width="244" height="243"></a></p>

<p>Built in 1882 by wealthy New Yorkers who eventually settled in Boulder, Earl House radiates the warmth of its Victorian heritage. “I keep hearing from guests that it’s the nicest and most elegant inn they’ve ever stayed at,” reports Kathryn Ode, Manager, beaming with pride. From the oak, cherry and mahogany woodwork that greet you in the marvelous foyer, to the Thomas Hatfield sofas that invite you to relax for a while, Ode might just be right.</p>

<p>One of the keystones of Earl House are the one-of-a-kind ceramic tiles that adorn the fireplaces, each one hand-painted by Mrs. Greene, the original owner. The inn owners, Jeffrey White and Matthew Dyross, have complemented her artistic decor with a full-wall mural painted by local artist Ben Brown, who also hand painted the tiles in each of the inn’s bathrooms.</p>

<p>Earl House’s intimate atmosphere is embellished by rooms such as The Bird’s Eye Maple Room, elegantly finished throughout with hand carved bird’s eye maple trim, fireplace mantel and arched gothic balcony door. Victorian antiques add the perfect romantic touch. Each of the five other rooms features private baths and distinctive Victorian themes.</p>

<p>The pleasures of Earl House come alive each morning when Kathryn and her staff prepare a breakfast of delights fit for kings and queens, then serve it with lavish attention to the guest experience. The parlor’s three breakfast tables are set with fine linens and china, with fresh fruits, home-made muesli, pastries and yogurts, and endless pots of fresh brewed coffee, tastefully spread on the library table. Guests are free to sit in the parlor, where exquisite hand carved fruitwood butler tables flank upholstered Victorian couches and chairs. Guests relax with a cup of steaming coffee as the courteous staff bring the daily papers.</p>

<p>Earl House Historic Inn , 2429 Broadway, Boulder, CO 80304; 303/938-1400. Six rooms in Inn, all w/private baths. Rates $139 to $179; Gourmet continental-plus breakfasts, afternoon tea and evening port included. Two carriage houses, 3 bedrooms each. Cancellation policy. No smoking, no pets. All major credit cards.</p>

<h2>Gold Lake Mountain Resort</h2>


<p>If the Earl House is the quintessential example of a city inn, then <em>Gold Lake Mountain Resort</em>, just twenty minutes northeast of Boulder, is surely its country cousin on a grand scale. Of all the majestic vistas in the Rockies, this is the very site where Chief Niwot chose to do his vision quests. And no wonder. The scenery simply takes one’s breath away.</p>

<p>Gold Lake Mountain Resort is the dreamchild of inn-trepreneurs Alice and Karel Starek. From the tastefully decorated cabins, guests have magnificent views of Gold Lake and the Continental Divide, their snow-capped peaks alluring even in summer. Guests can fish, swim, boat, mountain bike, ride horses, snowshoe, ice skate or cross-country ski, depending on the season.</p>

<p>The Starek’s have created a first-class resort worthy of the regal natural setting in every conceivable way. The eclectic yet elegant cabins reflect architect Alice’s sense of style and function. Tubs in the cabins include hammered copper surrounds, crafted by two local artists, which are sure to exact oohs and aahs from first time guests. Colorado slate bathroom floors are heated. Each cabin has a pot-belly stove, which guests may forego when they see the singular treats waiting for them in the bedroom. Puffed up a full sixteen inches or more are down comforters that mirror the expansive spaces of the West.</p>

<p>The Starek’s are visionaries when it comes to environmental impact. They have a full-time “restoration ecologist” on staff, whose job it is to steadily bring all aspects of the operation in synch with the God-given beauty of the area. Aside from composting all kitchen wastes, heavily trafficked areas are being restored to native grasses. Future plans include meeting electrical demands with solar arrays.</p>

<p>But, it is on the culinary side of the ledger that Gold Lake Resort ‘takes the cake,’ so to speak. Chef Nicholas Petti has advanced the state of the culinary arts, blending organic ingredients with just the right herbs in an artful presentation that is the equivalent of gastronomic heaven. Pan Seared Duck Breast with Blackberry/Sage Sauce and Sweet Potato Spaetzle share the menu with vegetarian dishes such as Savory Green Lentil Cake with Grilled Portobello Mushroom and Wild Rice.</p>

<p>Alice’s Restaurant, with its high ceilings and exposed wood, is the perfect complement to Petti’s creations. The restaurant’s romantic ambience blends locally made wood furniture and huge stone fireplace into a rustic sophistication that reflects the Starek’s loving restoration.</p>

<p>As if the setting and décor aren’t enough, guests can indulge themselves in a full array of spa services, from dual massages, to aromatherapy and herbal wraps. The indoor hot tub is only outdone by the two outdoor spas that are idyllically located on the shore of 35-acre Gold Lake, with a you-can-die-for panoramic view of the Continental Divide.</p>

<p>Gold Lake Mountain Resort &amp; Spa, 3371 Gold Lake Road, Ward, CO 80481, 800/450-3544. Seventeen units, all w/private baths. Swiss-style continental buffet breakfasts. Cancellation policy. No smoking, no pets. Visa, Discover and MasterCard only.</p>

<p><strong>Colorado Springs</strong></p>

<h2>Room at the Inn</h2>


<p>Ninety minutes due south of Boulder is Colorado Springs, the second largest city in the state. As a cultural and scenic hub, visitors are enamoured with historic names that are indelibly etched into our American consciousness. Names like Pike’s Peak, Cripple Creek, and the enchanting Garden of the Gods, revered by our Native American brothers and sisters, come to mind. As you approach the city, the modernistic spires of the Air Force Academy greet you in all their spiritual splendor, securely nestled against their mountainous backdrop.</p>

<p>Apropos to its name, <em>Room at the Inn</em> proprietors Jan and Chick McCormick welcome guests with an openness that is at once refreshing and sincere. Having grown up on a farm, Jan is the perfect hostess, greeting guests at the door, handling special requests, and serving her specialty multi-course breakfasts. “I enjoy making sure our guests have everything they need,” Jan says with her enchanting smile. “I love the activity in the Inn and people milling about relaxing and having a good time.”</p>

<p>Located in the historic center of Colorado Springs, Room at the Inn retains all the Victorian charm of its 1896 origins. All five guest rooms in the main house include private baths, queen size beds and a collection of period antiques that the McCormick’s have personally chosen to add touches of elegance or functionality to every nook and cranny. The third floor High Tower Room, for example, boasts an airy octagonal turret sitting room overlooking trees and garden, a French Walnut queen size bed and antiques tucked into corners that lend the perfect finishing touches for curling up with a good book. Not lacking in modern conveniences either, several rooms have whirlpool tubs for two.</p>

<p>Perhaps the most striking attention-getter at Room at the Inn is what guests notice is missing – dust and dirt. The McCormick’s pride themselves on the cleanliness of their inn. Guests are hard-pressed to find even a cobweb strand anywhere in this immaculately clean house.</p>

<p>The McCormick’s create an atmosphere of warm hospitality which revolves around their gourmet food. Each morning Jan and Chick prepare a full gourmet breakfast for guests. On a recent crisp summer morning, guests dined on the porch tables which were covered in white tablecloths and fine china. Inn staff started guests with a scrumptious dish of Hot Baked Pears with Oatmeal-Cranberry-Blueberry Sauce, delicately balanced between lightness and sweetness.</p>

<p>Next on the menu were Raspberry Streusal Muffins, followed by Baked Peach Pancakes with Honey-Raisin Sauce, complemented by endless cups of specially roasted coffee and fresh squeezed orange juice.</p>

<p>Afternoon tea includes an astounding seventy different varieties from around the world, accompanied by Jan’s homemade pastries and cookies.</p>

<p>Room at the Inn, 618 North Nevada Avenue, Colorado Springs, CO 80903; 719/442-1896. Five units in Main House, and two units in Cottage, all w/private baths. Full gourmet breakfast, afternoon tea and evening desserts included. Cancellation policy. No smoking. All major credit cards.</p>

<h2>Cheyenne Canyon Inn</h2>


<p><a href="http://blog.lesterpickerphoto.com/wp-content/uploads/2010/07/images.jpeg"><img class="size-full wp-image-297 " title="images" src="http://blog.lesterpickerphoto.com/wp-content/uploads/2010/07/images.jpeg" alt="" width="240" height="192"></a></p>

<p>Just blocks away from downtown, one approaches the majesty of South Cheyenne Canyon and its natural wonder, Seven Falls, both of which are visible from the eclectic <em>Cheyenne Canyon Inn</em>. The huge 13,000 square foot house, built in the 1920’s, was formerly a bordello and gambling casino in its shadier days. There are even secret tunnels radiating from the basement, where patrons could disappear into the night woods in case of a police raid. Today, innkeepers Barbara, John and Josh Starr have turned the inn into a bed and breakfast showcase.</p>

<p>But, before entering, be forewarned. The kindly ghost of a petite young lady of the night, dressed in white, has been seen by guests walking down the wide main staircase, disappearing as she enters the cavernous Great Room, with its seven foot windows and spectacular views of Cheyenne Mountain. There are still impressions in the oak floor where the original gambling machines earned their keep.</p>

<p>Each of the seven rooms in the inn, and the secluded chateau, reflects a different country theme, from hacienda to cabana, from Swiss chalet to African hut, all connected to the worldwide living experiences of the Starr’s, while John worked for a chemical company.</p>

<p>Guests of Cheyenne Canyon Inn tend to rise early to take advantage of the region as the hummingbird capital of the state. Feeders on the property and directly across the road at the nature center attract them, providing hour upon hour of viewing pleasure. A hummingbird stained glass window in the inn buoys the spirit when the morning sun illuminates its playful birds.</p>

<p>All the major renovation work was done by John, who blames <em>Country Inns</em> for his passion for the genre. “<em>Country Inns</em> is responsible for us being in the B &amp; B business,” John says smiling. “But we’re happy with the end result, creating an atmosphere where people can relax within hours of arriving.”</p>

<p>And relaxing, according to the Starr’s, is enigmatically tied to the dining experience. Each morning, Barbara and her son, Josh, serve guests a full breakfast featuring a different country theme. “When people are on vacation they’re not dieting,” Barbara says as she prepares a luscious batch of malted waffles, “so our food is indulgent and full of choices for our guests.”</p>

<p>With Barbara cooking behind the scenes, John and Josh pamper their guests with a Parsley Cheese Quiche featuring aromatic herbs from their garden. Individually prepared malted waffles with homemade Caramel Pecan Sauce are eagerly anticipated by repeat guests. A bowl of refreshing Cold Cantaloupe Soup clears the palate, followed by Barbara’s Two-Layer Blueberry Cake.</p>

<p>Hiking and bicycling paths leave the inn property, winding their way through the adjoining natural areas, a good thing to do when you finally push yourself away from Barbara’s indulgent treats.</p>

<p>Cheyenne Canyon Inn,2030 West Cheyenne Boulevard, Colorado Springs, CO 80906; 719/633-0625. Seven units in Main House, and one Chateau, all w/private baths. Full gourmet breakfast, afternoon tea and evening desserts included. Cancellation policy. No smoking, no pets. All major credit cards.</p>
