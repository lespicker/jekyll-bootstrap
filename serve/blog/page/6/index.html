  <div class="entry-content"><p><em><strong>Please Note</strong></em>: We have decided to extend the bird photography contest deadline by one month to <strong>January 23, 2013</strong>. We received several slaps up side-the-head from potential entrants reminding us that the holiday season is no time to detract people from their primary spiritual goal of spending money on worthless stuff (meaning anything not photography-related).  So, please spread the word that the contest is still open. To better understand the prizes, please visit our <a href="http://www.lesterpickerphoto.com">revised website</a>.</p>

<p>First, some random musings regarding bird photography, prompted by  something I read recently about one of my mentors, the incomparable Roger Tory Peterson, who died in 1996. My younger readers may not even know the name, more&#8217;s the pity, but anyone over 40 who was even remotely involved in nature pursuits will undoubtedly recognize the name, if only from his signature Peterson Nature Guides.</p>

<p>I&#8217;ll start off by saying that I tip my hat to all bird photographers. You folks are out there at all hours of the day, but especially at sunrise, attempting to shoot nervous little critters that just will not sit still. They flit, they fret, they fly up, down and sideways. It&#8217;s winged ADHD.</p>

<p>It&#8217;s odd that I never got into bird photography in any major way, especially due to the influence that Roger Peterson had on my life. When I was doing my ecology graduate work at the University of Maine, I approached Roger, arguably the preeminent popular ornithologist of his time, author and artist, for help. I had met Roger when I interviewed him for a biology publication and afterwards he graciously took on this young, eager ecologist as a student of sorts. I remember sitting in his windowed Connecticut studio, surrounded by his lovely artwork, pestering him with questions and listening to his suggestions for my research.</p>

<p><a href="http://blog.lesterpickerphoto.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/12/DSC4098-1.jpg"><img class="alignnone size-medium wp-image-2482" title="_DSC4098 (1)" src="http://blog.lesterpickerphoto.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/12/DSC4098-1-200x300.jpg" alt="" width="200" height="300"></a></p>

<p>But, while I marveled at Roger&#8217;s deep knowledge and his love of nature, I have never been drawn to bird photography in any serious way. Sure, I&#8217;ve captured some decent photos of my feathered friends from time to time, but I&#8217;ve never mastered its art. I do, however, acknowledge those photographers who have.</p>

<p><a href="http://blog.lesterpickerphoto.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/12/LAP67771.jpg"><img class="alignnone size-medium wp-image-2485" title="_LAP6777" src="http://blog.lesterpickerphoto.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/12/LAP67771-300x225.jpg" alt="" width="300" height="225"></a></p>

<h3>Contest</h3>


<p>In honor of the upcoming annual Christmas Bird Count, I&#8217;m announcing an impromptu photo contest for my readers. If you have a really fantastic image of a bird that you&#8217;d be willing to share in my blog, please send it  to me (<strong>les@lesterpickerphoto.com</strong>), along with a brief description of how you captured the image and the name of the bird. Just one entry per person, please.</p>

<p>I am awarding a 1st, 2nd and 3rd place prize. First place winner will receive a 16&#8221;x24&#8221; print of his/her choice from a collection of top-notch images in a special gallery of images we will present to the winner, plus a $500 gift certificate toward one of my Limited Edition prints. The image will be printed on Museo Fine Art,. museum-quality archival paper, using an Epson 9900 with UltraChrome HD inks. Second prize will be an 8.5 x 11&#8221; print (see specs above), plus a $50 gift certificate toward a Folio Collection. Third prize will be a ColorPlak image of the winner&#8217;s choice, chosen from a collection of my available ColorPlaks at the time of award. In all cases, winners must pay the cost of postage (via PayPal) only. Postage will be charged at its exact cost, with no markup.</p>

<p>Judging will be done by my assistant, Bob Boyer, and me. The deadline is midnight, December 23 (now January 23, 2013) and winners will be announced by December 31 (now January 31, 2013). By entering, of course, you give us permission to post your winning image on this blog site, with full credit to you as the photographer, along with your comments. We may ask a few more questions to make an interesting blog entry.</p>

<p>Good luck!</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>To paraphrase, if you eat sausage, you don&#8217;t want to see how it&#8217;s made. In a similar vein, I thought I&#8217;d show you how a product shoot is staged, for better or worse. If you have a queasy stomach, look away.</p>

<p>For our revised website, which premiers in a couple of weeks, we needed to show potential clients how our Portfolio boxes look. Here is one of the results of that shoot.</p>

<p><a href="http://blog.lesterpickerphoto.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/11/DSCF4711.jpg"><img class="size-medium wp-image-2476" title="DSCF4711" src="http://blog.lesterpickerphoto.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/11/DSCF4711-300x199.jpg" alt="" width="300" height="199"></a></p>

<p> </p>

<p>Having been commissioned to produce 30 of these boxes for one client recently, we decided to set up shop in the upstairs of my home. We chose that spot because it is well lit and would not need extra light stands, flashes, diffusers and other paraphernalia of the product-shot trade. There are times when we have to resort to elaborate setups, but in this case we felt that we could get reasonable images without so much fuss. It was worth a try at least.</p>

<p>After umpteen trips upstairs with the goods, we finally dragged up the cameras and got to work. Normally we would lay out fancy materials or backdrops but, again, we wanted simplicity. We also knew that we would be shooting tight, making elaborate props unnecessary.</p>

<p>Bob took this shot of me at work with my Hasselblad H4D-50 and 50-110mm lens. Bob shot his images on his Fuji x100, hand-held (pretty impressive little camera&#8230; in the hands of a pro).</p>

<p><a href="http://blog.lesterpickerphoto.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/11/DSCF4721.jpg"><img class="size-medium wp-image-2477" title="DSCF4721" src="http://blog.lesterpickerphoto.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/11/DSCF4721-300x199.jpg" alt="" width="300" height="199"></a></p>

<p> </p>

<p>My point in sharing this with you is that with today&#8217;s digital cameras, you really don&#8217;t need a lot of other fancy stuff to get solid images that meet your needs. If you shoot in RAW, you can change the white balance to achieve the color balance you want, from cool to warm. You can crop, burn, dodge, globally adjust and fine tune. In fact, if there are indoor projects you&#8217;ve been wanting to do, winter is the perfect time to check them off your to-do list.</p>

<p>As an American, I know just how fortunate we are to live in such variegated landscapes, rich in water and woods, mountains and prairies, and blessed with the mineral wealth we need for life and commerce. I have spent the better part of my life documenting its majesty both in writing and images.</p>

<p>But I have come to know that there is a secret, magical land sitting on top of us. Well, north of us anyway. With a far greater land mass than we enjoy here in the United States and with one-tenth the number of people, much of Canada appears to us landscape photographers exactly as it did to First Nation people, Canadian trappers and pioneers hundreds of years ago. Take Canada’s Yukon Territory, for example. With a land area some 20% larger than California, it has only 30,000 residents, compared to California’s 33 million. With about 30,000 bears, 60,000 moose and 250,000 caribou, plus elk, fox and eagles, it is also a wildlife photographer’s paradise.</p>

<p>One of the things I love about Canada is that, as a landscape artist, I don’t have to battle crowds to record the images I visualize. I can take my time surveying the area for the best vantage points, set up my tripod, and shoot, reposition and shoot again. Some of the images, in fact, took multiple visits before I was happy with the results.</p>

<p>Each image in this <em>Folio Collection</em> was individually prepared for printing and then hand-printed on Museo Silver Rag archival, museum-quality, fine art paper (300gsm). Prints will last at least 100 years if they are properly cared for. To that end, please store them in the Folio at room temperatures.</p>

<p>The landscapes in this <em>Folio Collection</em> were recorded between 2007 and 2011 using digital capture on Nikon and Hasselblad professional equipment.</p>

<p>Periodically I issue other hand-printed <em>Folio Collections</em>. Please check back from time to time for new releases. If you are interested in purchasing this <em>Folio Collection</em> please click <a href="http://shop.lesterpickerphoto.com/page/201">here</a>.</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>To paraphrase the famous Shaker song, simplicity is a virtue. I&#8217;ll add my voice to that song any day when it comes to photography.</p>

<p>What I mean by that is what I often refer to as &#8216;essence.&#8217; I&#8217;ve addressed this issue recently in a blog I called &#8221;<a href="http://blog.lesterpickerphoto.com/2012/11/08/finding-the-essence/">Finding the Essence</a>.&#8221; I&#8217;d like to take that a step further in this blog. When we are out in the field and observe a landscape that we want to photograph, we are often swamped by the sheer detail in the scene. Landscapes, after all, are typically complex scenes. There are trees, rocks, clouds, mountains and water, often in the same scene! How do we convey a story, the story we want to tell, in such a jumble of concepts?</p>

<p>I often urge my students to think in terms of what is the story that you are trying to tell? Can you reduce it to a single concept? If so, how can you manipulate the scene to emphasize that story line? Can you crop out the extraneous, distracting elements? Can you move the focal point to better tell the story or emphasize one detail over another?</p>

<p>Going one step further is the long-revered concept in photography known as minimalism. How can you tell that very same story by reducing the elements in your photo to the very basics. And here is where I&#8217;d like to introduce you to one of the photographers who recently took my Acadia National Park workshop.</p>

<p>His name is Lew Rothman, and he is a retired radiologist from the Big Apple. Lew is in some respects from the old school of photography. He is deliberate in his approach to a shot. He does not lean on the shutter release button to record 25 images and hope one is right. On this particular day, we had just completed a sunrise shoot at Sand Beach. As we traveled the famed Ocean Drive, we stopped here and there for photo shoots. On one of our stops, Lew managed this image:</p>

<p><a href="http://blog.lesterpickerphoto.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/11/O6C6835_HDR.jpg"><img class="alignnone size-medium wp-image-2464" title="_O6C6835_HDR" src="http://blog.lesterpickerphoto.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/11/O6C6835_HDR-300x199.jpg" alt="" width="300" height="199"></a></p>

<p> </p>

<p>I&#8217;ll let Lew take over from here with his explanation:</p>

<p>&#8220;Although I had set out for a colorful sunrise, the dawn light and mysterious cloud cover seemed to call for a black and white interpretation of the cliffs and bay at Acadia National Park that morning. The lone denuded tree provided a strong vertical foreground visual element to contrast with the planar configuration of the rocks, sea and sky. My most successful compositions tend to be uncluttered and geometric in nature and this seemed to fit that objective. The image was executed as an HDR capture with 7 bracketed exposures, each varied by 1½ stops and first processed in NIK HDR Efex Pro2 and then converted to Black and white in NIK Silver Efex Pro2. Enclosed is a single mid exposure, the color HDR rendering as well as the final B&amp;W. Camera Canon 5D MK3, ISO 100, 24-105 mm F4.0 lens @35mm, mid exposure f 8 @1/80 sec.&#8221;</p>

<p>In my opinion, the lightbulb came on when Lew felt that the shot rendered better in B&amp;W.</p>

<p><a href="http://blog.lesterpickerphoto.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/11/O6C6835_HDR-Edit.jpg"><img class="alignnone size-medium wp-image-2465" title="_O6C6835_HDR-Edit" src="http://blog.lesterpickerphoto.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/11/O6C6835_HDR-Edit-300x199.jpg" alt="" width="300" height="199"></a></p>

<p> </p>

<p>I fully agree with his decision, and I think that is true because of the &#8216;essence&#8217; and minimalism concepts. Here we have the four basic elements of nature: sky, water, tree and earth. Lew was able to focus the reader&#8217;s attention on that and that alone. It is what I might call elemental. That minimalism helps the image. I think that the way he placed the tree using the Rule of Thirds helps, as does the way he rendered the clouds. Despite unfavorable weather conditions, Lew was able to extract a wonderful image from the outing. His use of HDR is restrained, which I feel also helps make the image.</p>

<p>Thanks to Lew for allowing me to share his work with my readers.</p>

<p>Pasteur said that chance favors the prepared mind. I would say the same about capturing landscape images. I know that the more prepared I am for an assignment, the better the images tend to be.</p>

<p>My wife was assisting me on an assignment to Canada&#8217;s Yukon Territory, a pure-and-simple magical land that I visit whenever I can. We had driven by RV nearly its entire length, from Whitehorse in the south, past the Arctic Circle in the north. I love stopping at Tombstone Valley because it is a landscape artist&#8217;s dream spot. It changes every season, every day, every hour and, as I learned here, every minute.</p>

<p>The day was threatening throughout and by mid-day the temps had dropped significantly, even though it was only late August. I thought it might be fruitless to stop for a shoot, but then I reconsidered, made a U-turn (try that in an RV!) and pulled into the overlook. There were only a few tourists watching the brewing storm. As I set up my tripod and camera, the storm clouds became more pronounced and the winds kicked up to near gale force. Everyone ran for their vehicles and got out of there in a hurry.</p>

<p>The winds were so fierce I had to brace my tripod by hanging my 30-pound backpack from the center hook. And then it happened. For the briefest of seconds the sun burst through the clouds. Snap, snap, snap and it was over! With my wife screaming for me to get my butt back into the RV, I ran for safety, just as the graying skies began dumping their white, fluffy load. We had to buck the winds to get to a secure campsite a few miles down the road, but I smiled all the way.</p>

<p>Not too many places on this planet can surpass the Canadian Rockies for a wildlife or landscape photographer. Majestic mountains, pristine lakes, moss-lined brooks, bear, moose, wolves…</p>

<p>I love the Rockies the most at sunrise, when I can witness the natural world coming alive. I arrive, headlamp leading me to the spot I have usually cased out the day before. I set up as the sun begins to announce its presence by lighting the sky just a tad. All is still, birds nervously await the sun&#8217;s warm rays and then, miraculously, the sun crests a nearby mountain and sprays of alpenglow ignite the peaks. The still waters reflect the mountains and meadows and sky.</p>

<p>All is well. It is the start of another Fall day on Rampart Pond.</p>
