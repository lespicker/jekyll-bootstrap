  <div class="entry-content"><p>Having a daughter who lives in northern Vermont is a good thing, especially if you’re a photographer. When I visit, and she’s out shopping or working, I can take the time to grab my camera gear and just poke around, exploring Vermont’s back roads.</p>

<p>Speaking of Vermont’s roads, the Northern Kingdom (what locals call the far northern part of the state) must have one of the highest percentages of unpaved to paved roads in the country, forcing me to slow down and soak in the myriad small farms, forest lots and old New England homes that beautify the landscape. I must average 10 miles/hour, craning my neck this way and that, deciding on what will make a good image. Anyone following me on a GPS would think I was nuts, considering how many times I back up or make u-turns.</p>

<h3>Barr Hill Natural Area</h3>


<p>So a few days ago I came across a tiny jewel of a park in northern Vermont, tucked away in a remote area, that is absolutely perfect for photography. It’s called Barr Hill Natural Area. Covering a tad more than 250 acres, the 7/10-mile nature trail loops through the property with a few side spurs and is smartly laid out for a small park. Barr Hill is run by The Nature Conservancy (thank you!). Despite very little change in elevation this highlands trail weaves in and out of beautiful scenics as you hike into and out of the woods.</p>

<p><a href="http://blog.lesterpickerphoto.com/wp-content/uploads/2011/06/LAP1063-Panorama.jpg"><img class="size-medium wp-image-1233" title="_LAP1063 Panorama" src="http://blog.lesterpickerphoto.com/wp-content/uploads/2011/06/LAP1063-Panorama-300x296.jpg" alt="" width="300" height="296"></a></p>

<p>At the entrance to the trail, there is a sign-in book and free brochures that include a map of the loop. Along the way you encounter numbered posts that correspond to interpretive information in the brochure about what you are seeing. The guide is informative without being overwhelming especially if, like me, you’ll be putting down your tripod and camera each time you read the information.</p>

<p>Few people come to this remote preserve. On a Friday, I only met one couple hiking together. That gave me time to amble, looking for possible images. In the end I only took a few images since I had only two lenses with me and limited time. But I did write down a few places that I think would lend themselves to winter scenics. I intend to be back.</p>

<p>The park is situated at 2,100 feet elevation, so when there are clearings in the woods, you can see for miles. The area around Barr Hill is home to moose, white-tailed deer, and black bear, as well as many small mammals and birds. All forest growth is relatively recent, as the mountain was extensively logged in the 19<sup>th</sup> century.</p>

<p><a href="http://blog.lesterpickerphoto.com/wp-content/uploads/2011/06/LAP1068-Panorama.jpg"><img class="aligncenter size-medium wp-image-1234" title="_LAP1068 Panorama" src="http://blog.lesterpickerphoto.com/wp-content/uploads/2011/06/LAP1068-Panorama-266x300.jpg" alt="" width="266" height="300"></a></p>

<h3>Getting There</h3>


<p>Getting to the park is part of the charm of the outing. I drove down gravel roads, along small dairy farms with stone fences, and finally up a long, rutted road to the preserve’s tiny entrance. Here are the directions, taken straight from The Nature Conservancy brochure (with a few modifications by me):</p>

<p>At the center of Greensboro, VT find Willey’s General Store. Then take Wilson Street north for 0.1 mile. Bear right at the Greensboro Town Hall onto Lauredon Ave. Drive 0.6 mile and at a fork in the road, bear left onto Barr Hill Road, which is clearly marked. Go 1 mile to the Barr Hill Natural Area sign. Just before the sign on your left you will see a small winter parking area (you’ll have to hike to the park entrance during winter season). In other seasons, continue past the sign and gate for another 0.6 mile to a small trailhead parking area with room for 8-9 cars. Look for the Nature Trail sign and register box.</p>

<p>Enjoy!</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>Pssst! Here’s one of the best-kept secrets in America. It’s called the America the Beautiful – National Parks and Federal Recreational Lands – Senior Pass.</p>

<p><a href="http://blog.lesterpickerphoto.com/wp-content/uploads/2011/06/SeniorFRT.jpg"><img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-1229" title="SeniorFRT" src="http://blog.lesterpickerphoto.com/wp-content/uploads/2011/06/SeniorFRT.jpg" alt="" width="285" height="180"></a></p>

<p>The Senior Pass is available to any citizen (or permanent resident) over age 62 and can only be obtained in person at any National Park, Bureau of Land Management (BLM), Fish and Wildlife Service and many Department of Agriculture offices. I got mine while in New Mexico photographing at a BLM site. If you are a senior photographer, this has got to be the best deal around.</p>

<p>Unlike the Annual Pass for National Parks and other federal lands, the Senior Pass is good for a lifetime, or what’s left of it when you get to be 62. Participating agencies include the National Park Service, U.S. Department of Agriculture - Forest Service, Fish and Wildlife Service, Bureau of Land Management and Bureau of Reclamation. The Annual Pass is $80/ year, while the Senior Pass- drumroll, please- is an unbelievable $10! That’s for the aforementioned lifetime.</p>

<p>The pass admits the pass holder and passengers in a non-commercial vehicle at per vehicle fee areas and pass holder and 3 adults, at per person fee areas (children under 16 are admitted free). Many of us photographers find ourselves on BLM or Forest Service land, so the pass is quite versatile. On my recent New Mexico trip, I photographed primarily on BLM and National Monument lands.</p>

<p>The Senior Pass provides a 50% discount on some Expanded Amenity Fees charged for facilities and services such as camping, swimming, boat launch, and specialized interpretive services. Naturally, in those cases where Expanded Amenity Fees are charged, only the pass holder is given the 50% price reduction. The pass is non-transferable and generally does NOT cover or reduce special recreation permit fees or fees charged by concessionaires.</p>

<p>If you qualify, make sure that when you sign up you also ask for the rearview mirror hanging tag. You use that in park areas that are unstaffed when you enter. That happens often with photographers, since we often show up well before sunrise.</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>As a travel writer and photographer, I’m often asked about tipping. Do you tip? How much in France? How much in Africa? For what services? Professionally, I divide tipping into two categories; photography and everything else.</p>

<h3>Photography</h3>


<p>Let’s start with photography. At my photo workshops I often instruct people not to tip to allow you to take a person’s photograph. I’m not saying this like I have the moral high ground. I know this is a difficult issue and why short-change a few shekels to someone who is making $25 a month, on a good month?</p>

<p><a href="http://blog.lesterpickerphoto.com/wp-content/uploads/2011/06/bedouin-woman.jpg"><img class="size-medium wp-image-1223" title="bedouin woman" src="http://blog.lesterpickerphoto.com/wp-content/uploads/2011/06/bedouin-woman-240x300.jpg" alt="" width="240" height="300"></a></p>

<p>Aside from the fact that tipping for photos just encourages everyone to ask for money, making all our photo efforts that much more difficult, in my personal opinion I do believe that tipping is insulting to those you photograph. It turns them into subjects/objects rather than real people with whom we can establish a genuine connection.</p>

<p>Here’s how I work. Let’s say I’m in a market, which is one of my favorite places to capture people in the context of their culture. I roam around, camera casually hanging from my shoulder. I meet people’s eyes. I talk to them. I smile a lot, not to curry favor, but because I’m usually thoroughly enjoying myself. I ask questions about their craft or children. I laugh at my poor language skills. I buy something. (I admit it also helps if I have my wife along. Her winning smile and joie de vivre somehow both attracts people and puts them at ease.)</p>

<p>Only after this “relationship-building” phase will I ask, either by word or gesture, if I may take their picture. I am rarely refused and I’ve never had to pay. There have been exceptions, but usually because I was rushed and didn’t follow my normal modus operandi. I find that in this way the subject feels respected. We’ve made a human connection.</p>

<p><a href="http://blog.lesterpickerphoto.com/wp-content/uploads/2011/06/ecuadorpotatolady.jpg"><img class="size-medium wp-image-1224" title="ecuadorpotatolady" src="http://blog.lesterpickerphoto.com/wp-content/uploads/2011/06/ecuadorpotatolady-201x300.jpg" alt="" width="201" height="300"></a></p>

<p>If I’m in a rush and I snap a picture before asking for permission, I will delete it immediately if the person objects. Of course, as a pro, I have to have a signed permission form to use it in publications, so I carry cards, ready to hand out. I always show the resulting picture to the subject immediately, which is one of the joys of digital. I will also bring prints with me when I return to a spot or mail them to people when possible.</p>

<p><a href="http://blog.lesterpickerphoto.com/wp-content/uploads/2011/06/ecuadorbaby-mother.jpg"><img class="size-medium wp-image-1225" title="ecuadorbaby-mother" src="http://blog.lesterpickerphoto.com/wp-content/uploads/2011/06/ecuadorbaby-mother-300x188.jpg" alt="" width="300" height="188"></a></p>

<p>So much for photography tipping.</p>

<h3>Everything Else</h3>


<p>I know that the issue of tipping bothers some people. I mean really bothers them. Their argument is, why do I have to pay extra for good service? That should be expected. I agree. But tipping really is a mindset, and a form of travel etiquette.</p>

<p>The reality of modern life is that the tip is the norm. Wait staff rarely make a living wage without it. Ditto with bellhops and a host of occupations, especially when traveling in developing nations. What I do I learned from traveling to dozens of countries on all continents (except Antarctica, which I will remedy soon).</p>

<p>In the USA I generally add 20% to pre-tax restaurant bills and 15% in Canada, more if the service is exceptional. At airports I give a buck for each bag to the driver who loads/unloads them onto the shuttle bus and at curbside check-in. In hotels, I always leave $3-5/day for the housekeeper. If I will be staying for more than a few days, I usually pull the weekday housekeeper aside, get her name, give her an upfront tip and tell her I’ll be giving her an additional tip if she takes exceptional care of our room. Works wonders, but has no effect on bedbugs!</p>

<p>In Europe, I generally tip 10-15%. Central and South America, 10-15%. In Africa the norm is 5-10%, although that appears to be increasing. In Egypt, for example, make sure that the tip is not included in the bill before adding one yourself.</p>

<p>Australia is 10-15% for me, but New Zealand really depends. It’s a much more independent minded people and they will sometimes refuse a tip. Be sensitive to that. Ask, but don’t force a tip on someone who is reluctant. A nice thank-you will do.</p>

<p>Most people experience Africa and Egypt, in particular (Egypt is considered north Africa), through guided tours. Here is where I get the most complaints, since tourists might spend $5,000-10,000 or more for a tour, so why do they have to tip over and above that? Get over it. Tips are expected for your guide, porters, housekeepers. Right from the get-go, adjust your mindset. It’s not a $10,000 trip; it’s an $11,500 trip (okay, with liquor it’s a $15,0000 trip!).</p>

<p>The best way I have found to handle the correct amount is by asking the tour operator in advance what is the range of tip expected. Select your comfort level from within that range and give the people your tip directly, preferably the night before your last day. In many cases tips are all the compensation that person will get. Oh, and carry cash for the tip. Many of these workers do not have access to a bank and can’t cash a check.</p>

<p>On cruises, there are gratuity guidelines published by every cruise line. They even offer the option of signing up in advance for their standard tipping regime (or pencil in your own number) and having it auto-charged to your credit card. The staff is informed that you elected that option, although they do not know the exact amount. In general, plan for $15-20/day for gratuities that cover wait staff and housekeepers.</p>

<p>I like to think that my tipping conduct is a goodwill gesture advancing public opinion of Americans (or whatever your nationality) far more effectively than does our government’s policies. That’s my story and I’m sticking to it.</p>

<p><strong>I’d love to hear your opinions about tipping and any funny or just plain interesting stories about tipping.</strong></p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>If you are a reader of this blog, you probably already know that one of my goals is to learn large format (LF) photography this year. By ‘learn’ I don’t mean to become expert in its use. I’d be a fool to say that, given that some incredible photographers have spent a lifetime mastering this art form.</p>

<p>What I’m trying to do is determine whether a view camera has a role in producing the kind of prints that my clients are increasingly demanding; really huge prints that are crisp and clear and vibrant. I’m trying other techniques, but LF is currently my main focus, so to speak. I also promised to keep you all updated on my progress.</p>

<p>Now, I’m the kind of guy who digests as much as possible from books and articles. But, when it comes down to the nitty-gritty, I learn best from a mentor and from actually putting pedal to metal and trying things out.</p>

<p>Fortunately, for anyone wanting to get into LF, I found a terrific resource in Fred Newman, owner of The View Camera Store (<a href="http://www.viewcamerastore.com">www.viewcamerastore.com</a>). Fred has not only been selling this stuff for years, but he’s an accomplished LF photographer himself. That’s an unbeatable combo in my mind.</p>

<h3>A Simple Solution</h3>


<p>After fiddling around for two months near my home, I was ready to test my skills in the American southwest. One thing I was having trouble with was the focusing hood, which is the cloth that a LF photog throws over his head to focus the image on the glass screen. As it turns out, The View Camera Store offers the BTZS Focus Hood. I tried it out in several national parks around Albuquerque and I’ve got to say that hood is the best thing since sliced bread.</p>

<p><a href="http://blog.lesterpickerphoto.com/wp-content/uploads/2011/06/hood.jpg"><img class="size-medium wp-image-1214" title="hood" src="http://blog.lesterpickerphoto.com/wp-content/uploads/2011/06/hood-300x182.jpg" alt="" width="300" height="182"></a></p>

<p style="text-align: center;"></p>


<p>I had been frustrated by other well made, but cumbersome hoods. The BTZS is simple, very well made and dual function. When carrying my camera on my tripod, I use it as a protective cover. While focusing, its long Velcro closure allows me to manipulate it to shut out as much light as needed. It works even in the brightest southwest light.</p>

<p>Fred has a straightforward video explaining its use on YouTube, this one for a 4x5 view camera like the one I use. However, his store sells hoods for any size view camera.</p>

<p><a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2IduAabNQpY">http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2IduAabNQpY</a></p>

<p>Fred spent as much time as I needed on the phone with me advising me on other issues, such as loading and unloading my film out in the field. By time I left on my trip, I felt confident that I had a handle on my workflow.</p>

<p>I’ll report back on the results in a future blog.</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>My travel feature on my trip last summer to Vancouver-Jasper-Banff-Prince Rupert-Port Hardy-Nanaimo-Vancouver appeared in yesterday&#8217;s Baltimore Sun.</p>

<p>Generally, I&#8217;m happy with the article, but I have two complaints. First, I had to shorten it by 1,000 words to fit their format. Second, and most embarrassing, due to a computer glitch on their part while I was out of communication while hiking and photographing in New Mexico, they were not able to access my images. Instead, they purchased some stock images proving, as Forest Gump so eloquently said: &#8220;S<em> </em>t happens!&#8221;</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><!--StartFragment-->


<p>If I had to distill what I teach in a photo workshop to one lesson, it would be this: What exactly are you trying to say through that image? If you can tell me in 10 or 25 words exactly what the point of the image is, then we’re most probably looking at a good, maybe even a great image.</p>

<p>I know that sounds simplistic- any one ‘magic’ rule is- but the lack of a clear concept is what keeps a so-so image from being a wow! image. I see this in every type of photography, but most especially in landscapes and wildlife, where weather, land forms, flora and fauna, light and shadow all interact to add complexity that can obscure the meaning of the image.</p>

<h3>Is It Just For Identification?</h3>


<p>Here’s an example. Someone goes to a pristine habitat and comes back with an image of, say, a bear or moose or wolf. It might be a technically good shot; crisply focused, well lit, saturated colors. But the image just isn’t dynamic. Most of the time it is a full body shot of the animal and I think to myself, “Hmmm, that’s a nice bear identification photo for an ecology textbook.” But, was that the photographer’s intent? What did s/he want to say to us? What s/he mean for us to <strong><em>feel</em></strong>?</p>

<p>If you’re a taxonomist, then the story you are trying to tell is relatively simple, and I have no argument with you over it. This is lion; this is tiger; this is coyote. But I’ve met few taxonomic photographers in my day and even fewer people who would be dazzled by their images.</p>

<p>So, I always go back to the question: What is the story you are trying to tell through this image? What are you trying to say? What do you want to transmit to the viewer?</p>

<p>In many of the images I am asked to critique, the problem is too much information crowding the scene. In an awestruck moment, facing an incredibly beautiful scene, the photographer is often tempted to get everything possible into the image. The result is usually an inscrutable mess. Believe me, every time I go to the Grand Canyon I’m sorely tempted to capture it’s indescribable beauty in a single image, so I know the conundrum. But, after many visits, and perhaps the wisdom of years, I realize it’s plain impossible for me to do this. Now I capture what I call landscape vignettes of the Canyon and hope that together they tell the story.</p>

<h3>Lesson Relearned</h3>


<p>I was reminded of all this once again, as I prepared some images for exhibition and came across a sequence of images I had taken on a beautiful Fall day in the Canadian Rockies. I’ll give you some background and then let the images themselves speak to you.</p>

<p>I had just had a frightening bear encounter while I knelt in a stream, taking images that incorporated a distant mountain. As I stood up, not 15 feet away, was a big old black bear. Fortunately, he did not see or smell me, but the next several minutes were worrisome. I slowly removed my bear spray from my vest. I couldn’t take any images because it would alert the bear to my presence, so I received the time as a divine gift to just appreciate this beautiful creature. He eventually wandered off.</p>

<p>I drove a few miles down the road and stopped for lunch at a pond. As I got out of the car I noticed a mated pair of coyotes hunting across the pond. I snapped some images, even though they were out of range of my tele. I laid my camera down and started to eat.</p>

<p>In a few minutes, I felt the hair on my neck crawling. I turned slowly to see the male standing not 5 feet from me. He was so close, in fact, that my telephoto could not focus on him. I slowly put my food away, as I have a strict work ethic that does not allow me to feed wild animals. I spoke to him quietly, all the while setting up my camera-lens by feel to maximize my chances. With wild animals, photographic moments are fleeting. He backed away just enough for me to focus. I addressed him again, with some sounds that I have learned over the years garners the attention, if not disdain, of animals. He turned to look at me. I talked to him. He cocked his head this way and that. I answered. He responded. Click, click, talk, click, click. We connected.</p>

<h3>Your Call</h3>


<p>So here are the images. The first is “coyote,” maybe okay for a textbook. The second is… well… what does the second image say to you or do for <strong><em>you</em></strong>?</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>There seems to be a growing trend toward large prints among my clients. Vaulted ceilings in homes, large lobbies in hospitals and clinics, airy office spaces all seem to call out for huge images.</p>

<p>At the same time, digital cameras are steadily improving, offering crisper images from densely packed sensors, allowing even 12-megapixel images to be blown up to a decent size. Add to that some amazing software programs that use complex algorithms to blow up images and you have the photo equivalent of a super-sized Big Mac.</p>

<p>One of the results of the desire for larger and larger prints is that I have just begun shooting with a large-format 4x5 film camera for some of my work. I’ll continue to report on that in future blogs. It’s kind of funny, this return to the past for modern imagery, but to succeed in this business you have to be responsive to client desires, whatever direction that takes you in.</p>

<h3>How We Work</h3>


<p>I thought I’d describe here how we handled some work for a recent client, a financial advisement firm in the town where I live. My client’s office is in a first-floor wing of a large Victorian home. When I first saw the client reception area, I knew it needed a major makeover. The walls were a very nice, but … how can I say this politely?.. challenging color and were plastered with an assortment of artwork, awards and plaques that gave a very disjointed appearance. Certainly the initial impression was not the elegant appearance worthy of my client’s reputation and his upscale clientele.</p>

<p><a href="http://blog.lesterpickerphoto.com/wp-content/uploads/2011/06/client-installation-walls_2011-01-19_1243%C2%A9LesterPicker.jpg"><img class="size-medium wp-image-1183" title="client installation walls_2011-01-19_1243©LesterPicker" src="http://blog.lesterpickerphoto.com/wp-content/uploads/2011/06/client-installation-walls_2011-01-19_1243%C2%A9LesterPicker-300x200.jpg" alt="" width="300" height="200"></a></p>

<p>So, we rolled up our sleeves and analyzed the space, as well as the client’s perceived needs. We then suggested a design arrangement that we thought would meet his goals while offering a quality experience for clients. We also convinced him to have the walls painted a neutral and more soothing color.</p>

<p>After finding out his preference for images from my stock collection, I suggested others that were similar but not on my photo gallery site (<a href="http://www.lesterpickerphoto.com">www.lesterpickerphoto.com</a>). A few backs-and-forths later we had our selection of images nailed.</p>

<p>Then came the decision on display media. Our company offers several different display styles, including traditional framed prints, aluminum prints, fiberboard and face-mounted plexiglas. Within those four basic choices we offer many variations, depending on the client’s needs.</p>

<p>The reception area in this case fills two main functions; those that support the administrative assistant and those that serve the client. Using those two functionally distinct areas, we selected a fiberboard option for the administrative area and front-mounted plexiglas in the client environment.</p>

<p>With those selections made, including print sizes, we were one-third done with the project. Now came the difficult work!</p>

<h3>Mastering the Print</h3>


<p>I handed off the images to Bob Boyer, my very able assistant. Bob is a master at many things photographic, but I’ve got to think that printmaking is at the top of the list. Bob has an intuitive feel for a print, combined with an expert technical grasp of print-making and wide experience with software products. Bob is able to factor image size, paper weight and finish, and presentation medium and somehow always come up with the perfect recipe for presenting the image in its best light.</p>

<p>As soon as Bob was done and I had suggested tweaks based on my personal artistic vision, off they went to the respective labs. We can do traditional prints here in our office up to 13”x19”, using the fine HP Photosmart Pro B9180. But for larger prints or for other modalities, we have relationships with some of the finest labs in the country.</p>

<p>So, off went the files to be mounted on fiberboard to a lab in California, with which we have been doing business for some time. Then we sent the face-mounted plexi files to a master craftsman, Tom Rieger of Rieger Communications in Maryland.</p>

<h3>Rieger Communications</h3>


<p>Tom is a pioneer in digital photography and I challenge anyone to come up with another person who knows more about the topic than does Tom. His company does high-end exhibit work for the Smithsonian and for museums throughout the country.</p>

<p>Here I am at Rieger’s massive facility with the print run for this installation, which Bob and I drove down to inspect before going to finals (I live about 90 minutes from Rieger’s lab and workshops).</p>

<p><a href="http://blog.lesterpickerphoto.com/wp-content/uploads/2011/06/P1010267-Ap3-5200-1.jpg"><img class="size-medium wp-image-1184" title="P1010267-Ap3-5200-1" src="http://blog.lesterpickerphoto.com/wp-content/uploads/2011/06/P1010267-Ap3-5200-1-300x200.jpg" alt="" width="300" height="200"></a></p>

<p>Every print is precisely color managed by Tom and his graphics staff. The next image shows the print run that we examine before mounting.</p>

<p><a href="http://blog.lesterpickerphoto.com/wp-content/uploads/2011/06/P1010263-Ap3-5200-1.jpg"><img class="size-medium wp-image-1185 " title="P1010263-Ap3-5200-1" src="http://blog.lesterpickerphoto.com/wp-content/uploads/2011/06/P1010263-Ap3-5200-1-300x200.jpg" alt="" width="300" height="200"></a></p>

<p>Tom&#8217;s shop has the ability to run exacting prints up to an astounding 100 inches wide!</p>

<p><a href="http://blog.lesterpickerphoto.com/wp-content/uploads/2011/06/P1010268-Ap3-5200-1.jpg"><img class="size-medium wp-image-1186 " title="P1010268-Ap3-5200-1" src="http://blog.lesterpickerphoto.com/wp-content/uploads/2011/06/P1010268-Ap3-5200-1-300x200.jpg" alt="" width="300" height="200"></a></p>

<h3>Show and Tell</h3>


<p>A week later the plexi-mounted prints were ready for installation. Here are some shots of my images hanging in the client’s office.</p>

<p><a href="http://blog.lesterpickerphoto.com/wp-content/uploads/2011/06/LAP9280.jpg"><img class="size-medium wp-image-1187" title="_LAP9280" src="http://blog.lesterpickerphoto.com/wp-content/uploads/2011/06/LAP9280-300x199.jpg" alt="" width="300" height="199"></a></p>

<p><a href="http://blog.lesterpickerphoto.com/wp-content/uploads/2011/06/LAP9324.jpg"><img class="size-medium wp-image-1188" title="_LAP9324" src="http://blog.lesterpickerphoto.com/wp-content/uploads/2011/06/LAP9324-199x300.jpg" alt="" width="199" height="300"></a></p>

<p>Blog readers are often curious about the process and I hope this has answered your logistical questions. But there is one other issue I’ll address up front, and that’s how this process feels to me.</p>

<p>It’s hard to describe how great my satisfaction is in seeing my work mounted in someone’s office or home and knowing they are enjoying it. Once every image is mounted on a wall or hanging in a space, I step back and recall every nuance of the shot. I think back on the preparation for the shoot, the weather conditions that day, the smells and sounds and visuals of the moment. I remember the discussions with my associate, Bob Boyer, as we prepped the image for printing and planned the design for the installation. Finally, after hours doing the installation we can step back and review the entire process. And, it feels great.</p>

<p>As always, I welcome your feedback.</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>I love cutting out three or four days from my schedule and just rambling, camera in hand, to areas I have always wanted to visit or revisit. No schedule, no major assignment breathing down my neck, just the pure, unadulterated joy of being out in nature soaking it in.</p>

<p>For eight glorious days I was in New Mexico, four days on an assignment of sorts, and four days for myself, wandering through several National Monuments. I’ve already described Kasha-Katuwe Tent Rocks National Monument in a previous blog (<a href="http://blog.lesterpickerphoto.com/2011/05/25/tent-rocks-rocks/">http://blog.lesterpickerphoto.com/2011/05/25/tent-rocks-rocks/</a>), and here I’ll briefly describe El Morro and El Malpais National Monuments, which are near to each other and can be photographed in a day if you plan wisely. Of course, if you had a month and planned wisely, you’d have an even better photo experience!</p>

<h3>El Morro</h3>


<p>El Morro (The Headlands) is a smaller Monument than El Malpais. I love its accessibility, both for photographers and people with disabilities. From the visitors center there is a wonderful paved, circular path that takes one along the spectacular rock formation that is its mainstay scenic and to a small pool of water that was a godsend to the early settlers. The Zuni people built a pueblo atop the El Morro mesa around 1275 that eventually housed as many as 1,500 residents. The hikes around the mesa are populated with lots of interesting petroglyphs.</p>

<p>If you go early in the morning, the sun lights up the rock face and the pool area, so plan your visit to take full advantage of that. Hike around the mesa to get a feel for heavenly silence that the Zuni Indians were blessed with.</p>

<p><a href="http://blog.lesterpickerphoto.com/wp-content/uploads/2011/06/LAP0694.jpg"><img class="size-medium wp-image-1175" title="_LAP0694" src="http://blog.lesterpickerphoto.com/wp-content/uploads/2011/06/LAP0694-200x300.jpg" alt="" width="200" height="300"></a></p>

<h3>El Malpais</h3>


<p>El Malpais is a much larger and more varied park. I’d recommend that, at the very least, you plan to shoot at Sandstone Buffs area for good panoramic images.</p>

<p><a href="http://blog.lesterpickerphoto.com/wp-content/uploads/2011/06/Sandstone-Bluffs-Panorama-1.jpg"><img class="size-medium wp-image-1176" title="Sandstone Bluffs Panorama-1" src="http://blog.lesterpickerphoto.com/wp-content/uploads/2011/06/Sandstone-Bluffs-Panorama-1-300x248.jpg" alt="" width="300" height="248"></a></p>

<p>Ten minutes down the road you can finish your tour at La Ventana natural arch. As the sun finally sets over the high desert, you’ll be treated to an incredible show as the arch lights up. It’s a dazzling way to end a satisfying photographic ramble.</p>

<p><a href="http://blog.lesterpickerphoto.com/wp-content/uploads/2011/06/LAP0869-Panorama.jpg"><img class="size-medium wp-image-1177" title="_LAP0869 Panorama" src="http://blog.lesterpickerphoto.com/wp-content/uploads/2011/06/LAP0869-Panorama-300x123.jpg" alt="" width="300" height="123"></a></p>

<h3>If You Go</h3>


<p>Remember to bring lots of water if you plan to hike to the top of the trail. Also, be sure to wear solid hiking shoes that cover your ankle; anything less and you’ll be dumping gritty sand from your shoes every few minutes. Because of the dust, I recommend that you keep your camera either in your backpack or in a protective bag and pull it out only as needed.</p>

<p>As with any hike in New Mexico, wear plenty of sunscreen, wear a hat (and long sleeves and pants if you are sun sensitive), sunglasses and watch out for snakes. The later warning is only generic, as Tent Rocks has enough human presence that snakes avoid the area… but watch out for snakes! I always carry a snake bite kit.</p>

<p>You will also want to plan your visit to accommodate early morning or late afternoon shooting. Look at a map and check on sunrise/sunset times so that you time your appearance for when those rock faces will be glowing.</p>

<p>Finally, make good use of the ranger stations at both parks. Your tax money pays for it, so why not take advantage of the rangers’ intimate knowledge of their surroundings and follow some of their recommendations. The stations also offer a variety of brochures and exhibits that will better inform your photography.</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>You all probably know by now that I shoot travel, landscapes and wildlife nearly exclusively. I rarely shoot sports or ultra-fast action shots, like car races. But even wildlife shooters have a need for stopping fast action once in a while. Of course, if you are a bird photographer (God bless you all), you always need to stop action.</p>

<p>But now that I&#8217;m a &#8220;senior&#8221; photographer, my ability to hand-hold and control my camera at 1/30 or even 1/60 of a second has been severely compromised. Yet, I still want to capture that fast moving bear when I visit the Yukon, or a bird capturing its dinner. My solution is to use what is known as a Wimberley head mounted on my tripod.</p>

<p><a href="http://blog.lesterpickerphoto.com/wp-content/uploads/2011/05/LAP_4147.jpg"><img class="aligncenter size-medium wp-image-1168" title="LAP_4147" src="http://blog.lesterpickerphoto.com/wp-content/uploads/2011/05/LAP_4147-300x199.jpg" alt="" width="300" height="199"></a></p>

<p>Actually, since I travel often and have to backpack to remote locations, I use a lighter Wimberley Sidekick device, which quick-mounts perfectly onto my existing Really Right Stuff BH-55 ball head. It allows me to mount my Nikon 70-200 with a 1.4 tele-extender or a Nikon 200-400mm  and follow my subject smoothly and seamlessly, clicking away as I capture it in action.</p>

<p><a href="http://blog.lesterpickerphoto.com/wp-content/uploads/2011/05/LAP_4152.jpg"><img class="size-medium wp-image-1169" title="LAP_4152" src="http://blog.lesterpickerphoto.com/wp-content/uploads/2011/05/LAP_4152-199x300.jpg" alt="" width="199" height="300"></a></p>

<p>The Sidekick allows me to turn the entire head around 360 degrees. It also allows me full range of up and down movement. Every movement is smooth as silk with no herky-jerky sticking points. That alone allows me to freeze motion at slower shutter speeds, or to add motion blurs as I pan, with zero camera shake due to my hands and body.</p>

<p><a href="http://blog.lesterpickerphoto.com/wp-content/uploads/2011/05/LAP_4160.jpg"><img class="size-medium wp-image-1170" title="LAP_4160" src="http://blog.lesterpickerphoto.com/wp-content/uploads/2011/05/LAP_4160-199x300.jpg" alt="" width="199" height="300"></a></p>

<p>A brand new Sidekick goes for about $225, but I got mine used for under $100. I consider it an invaluable accessory when I&#8217;m out shooting wildlife.</p>

<p><a href="http://blog.lesterpickerphoto.com/wp-content/uploads/2011/05/LAP_4167.jpg"><img class="size-medium wp-image-1171" title="LAP_4167" src="http://blog.lesterpickerphoto.com/wp-content/uploads/2011/05/LAP_4167-300x199.jpg" alt="" width="300" height="199"></a></p>

<p>Note that you should mount your lens to the Sidekick, not the camera when using a telephoto. Then you can just twist the knurled knob on the lens to switch from landscape to portrait orientation.</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>This is a strange tale, but one worth telling. I was in New Mexico, speaking one day with a Native American about the protocol for visiting sites considered spiritual. What many tribes did was to leave an offering, perhaps a sprinkling of tobacco or a keepsake, as a gift to Mother Earth for allowing the visitor to take away some of the spiritual essence of the special place.</p>

<p>A few days later I just happened to be photographing on a trail and considered climbing to a higher spot for what I thought would be a better vantage point. The more I shot down below, the more it gnawed at me that just a hundred or so yards higher I could capture a magnificent image. So, with 25-pound backpack on and a 4x5 view camera mounted on my tripod, I attempted the climb.</p>

<p>I knew as soon as I started that I might have bit off more than I could chew. The footing was loose and sandy, with big rocks giving way under my feet. By time I got halfway up, I was soaked in sweat and sucking air (altitude: 7,600 feet). But, I had gotten to a slightly better vantage point, so I decided to heed the warnings of the mountain spirits and go no further. I took off my backpack and my favorite Tilley hat and got to work.</p>

<p>For the next thirty minutes I marveled at the red rock walls, the green trees, the dry wind carrying the intoxicating scent of ponderosa pine up the slope. It was, as a colleague says, a Zen moment. It was truly a gift from the mountain spirits.</p>

<p>Finally, I had had it. I was tired and hungry since it was 7:00 PM and I had been up since 4:30 AM for sunrise.  So, I packed up and literally slid back down the treacherous trail as the sun was setting. When I got to the bottom I realized I had left my favorite Tilley hat where I had taken the photos. That hat had accompanied me all over the globe for the past 12 years. It has kept me warm on top of mountains and sailed with me on several oceans, protected me from bat guano in caves and bird droppings in forests, in the Amazon rains and Egypt’s sun. Sure, it had a few holes in it, but I loved that hat.</p>

<p>Then, I grinned. Unconsciously, I had remembered to leave my gift for the mountain spirits. I smiled all the way back to the car.</p>
