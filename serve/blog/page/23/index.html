  <div class="entry-content"><p>A hearty congratulations to Barry and Gill in England, one of two winners of my free photo giveaway last month. Here are two photos that Barry took of the framed image, hanging in their lounge.</p>

<p><a href="http://blog.lesterpickerphoto.com/wp-content/uploads/2011/05/lester1.jpg"><img class="aligncenter size-medium wp-image-1145" title="lester1" src="http://blog.lesterpickerphoto.com/wp-content/uploads/2011/05/lester1-225x300.jpg" alt="" width="225" height="300"></a></p>

<p><a href="http://blog.lesterpickerphoto.com/wp-content/uploads/2011/05/lester2.jpg"><img class="aligncenter size-medium wp-image-1146" title="lester2" src="http://blog.lesterpickerphoto.com/wp-content/uploads/2011/05/lester2-225x300.jpg" alt="" width="225" height="300"></a></p>

<p>Gill gave us a heads-up on the process:</p>

<blockquote>
<div><strong><em>&#8220;I was given the task of choosing one of your prints, which I have to say was very hard, far too much choice. I managed to break it down to a seascape, the Hawaii sunset took it. It makes a change from looking out of our window at the British summer ha, ha.</em></strong></div>
<div><strong><em>
</em></strong></div>
<div><strong><em>
</em></strong></div>
<div><strong><em>&#8220;From there I went with what I felt would look the best in our lounge. The colours and lighting compliment our colour schemes, and the print now has pride of place on the wall.</em></strong></div>
<div><strong><em>
</em></strong></div>
<div><strong><em>
</em></strong></div>
<div><strong><em>&#8220;It also took a bit of time to pick the right frame, which is real Oak , (not often found here in the UK), and hopefully have done your fab photo justice.&#8221;</em></strong></div>
</blockquote>


<div>Thanks for the update, Gill, and Barry for the photos. May the image adorn your abode for many years to come and may you both enjoy it in good health!</div>


<div>Best Wishes,</div>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>There are many things wonderful about Albuquerque, from its central New Mexico location to its fine restaurants, museums and outdoor activities. As a landscape photographer, I’d say that I most enjoy the myriad stunning vistas that are in or within an hour or two of Albuquerque’s center. Since one of my photographic goals this year is to expand my panorama skills, what better place to test out new techniques than the southwest?</p>

<h3>Kasha-Katuwe Tent Rocks National Monument</h3>


<p>I visited one of these sites last week, the incredible Kasha-Katuwe Tent Rocks National Monument, about an hour northwest of Albuquerque. Kasha-Katuwe means ‘white cliffs,’ which is immediately noticeable as you enter the Monument from the parking area (please click on photos to enlarge).</p>

<p><a href="http://blog.lesterpickerphoto.com/wp-content/uploads/2011/05/LAP0646-Panorama.jpg"><img class="size-medium wp-image-1155" title="_LAP0646 Panorama" src="http://blog.lesterpickerphoto.com/wp-content/uploads/2011/05/LAP0646-Panorama-290x300.jpg" alt="" width="290" height="300"></a></p>

<p>The hike is along a very sandy and dusty trail and before every shot sequence I had to brush my lens off with a lens brush. Even so I found dust on my sensor on many images. Still, the hike was so incredible (and the weather so miserable the first day), I came back a second day.</p>

<p>The 1.5 mile trail starts at an elevation of 5,570 feet and ends at the summit at 6,760 feet. But what you will traverse during that time- and I use the word time advisedly- will elicit oohs and aahs at every twist and turn in the trail. As you hike, you go back in geologic time, some 6-7 million years.</p>

<h3>Hoodoos</h3>


<p>The hoodoos you see throughout the hike were formed by the blast from a super-volcano that left deposits over 1,000 feet thick. Due to differences in the composition of the deposits, the soils have eroded differentially, leaving tall, inverted cones (hoodoos). Hoodoos that have rock caps on top are protected from erosion, while those without the caps are in various states of decay, creating the sandy footing throughout the monument.</p>

<p><a href="http://blog.lesterpickerphoto.com/wp-content/uploads/2011/05/LAP0559-Panorama.jpg"><img class="size-medium wp-image-1156" title="_LAP0559 Panorama" src="http://blog.lesterpickerphoto.com/wp-content/uploads/2011/05/LAP0559-Panorama-300x178.jpg" alt="" width="300" height="178"></a></p>

<p>The hike wasn’t easy for me. I decided to bring my Arca Swiss 4x5 large format view camera with me. But to use that heavy monstrosity, I needed my 35mm Nikon D700 to act as a spot meter, telling me how to expose the Velvia 50 film I use. So I was slogging uphill through sand that was sometimes ankle deep, carrying a 25-pound backpack and a 10-pound tripod with view camera mounted on it slung over my shoulder. Ouch!! if I keep up working with my 4x5 I’ll invest in a small  light meter, for sure.</p>

<p>The trail winds through a marvelous slot canyon, with some passages so narrow only one person at a time can squeeze through. This next image I took just at the beginning of the canyon. I was struck by the magnificent Ponderosa Pine roots set against the sheer rock walls and the distant trees. As I set up to shoot, it occurred to me that those roots were exposed over the years by torrential rainwater surging down the canyon. Eventually the root tissue becomes barked over for protection. This panorama shot doesn’t come close to its awesome size and commanding presence.</p>

<p><a href="http://blog.lesterpickerphoto.com/wp-content/uploads/2011/05/LAP0616-Panorama.jpg"><img class="size-medium wp-image-1157" title="_LAP0616 Panorama" src="http://blog.lesterpickerphoto.com/wp-content/uploads/2011/05/LAP0616-Panorama-300x112.jpg" alt="" width="300" height="112"></a></p>

<p>If you visit Albuquerque, and after you read this series of blogs you may well decide to do so, plan on a trip to Kasha-Katuwe Tent Rocks National Monument. You’ll not be disappointed.</p>

<h3>If You Go</h3>


<p>Remember to bring lots of water if you plan to hike to the top of the trail. Also, be sure to wear solid hiking shoes that cover your ankle; anything less and you’ll be dumping gritty sand from your shoes every few minutes. Because of the dust, I recommend that you keep your camera either in your backpack or in a protective bag and pull it out only as needed.</p>

<p>As with any hike in New Mexico, wear plenty of sunscreen, wear a hat (and long sleeves and pants if you are sun sensitive), sunglasses and watch out for snakes. The latter warning is only generic, as Tent Rocks has enough human presence that snakes avoid the area… but watch out for snakes!</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>This week I visited Sky City, an ancient pueblo atop a 370-foot tall mesa in the high desert outside Albuquerque. The day was windy, overcast and cold, dust blowing everywhere. Yet, despite the weather, I was struck by the very special, even spiritual feelings this tiny village exudes. Built in the 12th century, archaeologists believe the community chose the mesa for defensive purposes. It’s sheer walls are pretty impressive, to be sure. Still, the tiny pueblo was decimated by the Spaniards, who killed 90% of the men, women and children in what is known as the Battle of Acoma. Years later, in a coordinated rebellion with other Pueblo people, the Acoma people drove the Spanish out of the region and regained their culture, albeit forever changed by the Spanish.</p>

<p>From the beautiful Sky City Cultural Center, a tourist bus crunches its way up the gravel road to the top, where 30 Acoma families rotate living for a year, to hold fast to their traditional ways and to ensure that Sky City remains the oldest continuously inhabited community in the United States. I still have much to learn about the Acoma, but on this day, for the brief time I had atop the mesa, I’ll let my camera be your guide (please click on each image to enlarge).</p>

<p><a href="http://blog.lesterpickerphoto.com/wp-content/uploads/2011/05/LAP0424.jpg"><img class="size-medium wp-image-1128" title="_LAP0424" src="http://blog.lesterpickerphoto.com/wp-content/uploads/2011/05/LAP0424-300x199.jpg" alt="" width="300" height="199"></a></p>

<p>The views from atop the mesa are stunning, with vast expanses of high desert interspersed with nearby mesas.</p>

<p><a href="http://blog.lesterpickerphoto.com/wp-content/uploads/2011/05/sky-city-pueblo-6.jpg"><img class="size-medium wp-image-1129" title="sky city pueblo-6" src="http://blog.lesterpickerphoto.com/wp-content/uploads/2011/05/sky-city-pueblo-6-300x199.jpg" alt="" width="300" height="199"></a></p>

<p>The Acoma people live in these homes today. Some are simple adobe construction, others have been renovated with stone or brick.</p>

<p><a href="http://blog.lesterpickerphoto.com/wp-content/uploads/2011/05/Sky-city-pueblo_1.jpg"><img class="size-medium wp-image-1130" title="Sky city pueblo_1" src="http://blog.lesterpickerphoto.com/wp-content/uploads/2011/05/Sky-city-pueblo_1-199x300.jpg" alt="" width="199" height="300"></a></p>

<p>The Acoma people still value their traditional ways. The kiva is a place for rituals and meetings. The ladder serves a ceremonial as well as a utilitarian purpose.</p>

<p><a href="http://blog.lesterpickerphoto.com/wp-content/uploads/2011/05/sky-city-pueblo-3.jpg"><img class="size-medium wp-image-1131" title="sky city pueblo-3" src="http://blog.lesterpickerphoto.com/wp-content/uploads/2011/05/sky-city-pueblo-3-199x300.jpg" alt="" width="199" height="300"></a></p>

<p><a href="http://blog.lesterpickerphoto.com/wp-content/uploads/2011/05/sky-city-pueblo-2_.jpg"><img class="aligncenter size-medium wp-image-1132" title="sky city pueblo-2_" src="http://blog.lesterpickerphoto.com/wp-content/uploads/2011/05/sky-city-pueblo-2_-199x300.jpg" alt="" width="199" height="300"></a></p>

<p>The mission church still stands, although many Acoma people prefer traditional spiritual beliefs. The church is also used as a meeting place.</p>

<p><a href="http://blog.lesterpickerphoto.com/wp-content/uploads/2011/05/sky-city-pueblo-4.jpg"><img class="size-medium wp-image-1133" title="sky city pueblo-4" src="http://blog.lesterpickerphoto.com/wp-content/uploads/2011/05/sky-city-pueblo-4-199x300.jpg" alt="" width="199" height="300"></a></p>

<p>There is no plumbing in Sky City, so outhouses are clustered in various locations within the mesa.</p>

<p><a href="http://blog.lesterpickerphoto.com/wp-content/uploads/2011/05/sky-city-pueblo-5.jpg"><img class="size-medium wp-image-1134" title="sky city pueblo-5" src="http://blog.lesterpickerphoto.com/wp-content/uploads/2011/05/sky-city-pueblo-5-300x199.jpg" alt="" width="300" height="199"></a></p>

<p>Baking bread is an important tradition and every Acoma home has an outdoor cooking oven.</p>

<p><a href="http://blog.lesterpickerphoto.com/wp-content/uploads/2011/05/LAP0506.jpg"><img class="size-medium wp-image-1135" title="_LAP0506" src="http://blog.lesterpickerphoto.com/wp-content/uploads/2011/05/LAP0506-199x300.jpg" alt="" width="199" height="300"></a></p>

<p>But, like with any culture, it is the people that hold it together. The Acoma people value storytelling, song and dance to impart their culture to future generations. Here are some child residents of Sky City (taken with permissions).</p>

<p><a href="http://blog.lesterpickerphoto.com/wp-content/uploads/2011/05/LAP0443.jpg"><img class="aligncenter size-medium wp-image-1136" title="_LAP0443" src="http://blog.lesterpickerphoto.com/wp-content/uploads/2011/05/LAP0443-199x300.jpg" alt="" width="199" height="300"></a></p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>I was revisiting my images from my New Zealand assignment last Fall and I came across this one. I took this on the second day of a two-day visit to Lake Tekapo, on New Zealand’s South Island. This is the iconic Church of the Good Shepard, which has been photographed every possible which way over the years by tourists, large format photographers, 35mm shooters, probably even pinhole aficionados. And no wonder. The church is situated at the edge of the lake, surrounded by a ring of snow-capped mountains. If there is a prettier church anywhere, please let me know!</p>

<p><a href="http://blog.lesterpickerphoto.com/wp-content/uploads/2011/05/Tekapo-Church.jpg"><img class="aligncenter size-medium wp-image-1125" title="Tekapo Church" src="http://blog.lesterpickerphoto.com/wp-content/uploads/2011/05/Tekapo-Church-300x199.jpg" alt="" width="300" height="199"></a></p>

<p>As I always do before a major assignment, I had developed a list of shots I wanted to take and in Lake Tekapo (pronounced <strong>Tee</strong>’-ka-po) I badly wanted a shot of the church at sunrise. But the weather did not cooperate. It had rained continuously on the first day and when I went out for sunrise, there was none. The day dawned gray, cold and miserable.</p>

<p>To say I was frustrated would be putting it mildly. I mean, I came halfway around the planet and this was to be a go-to shot. To make matters even worse, the wind was blowing at gale force and a major storm was forecast. Now, some of my best images have come when the weather has been atrocious. In fact, I have learned to relish those opportunities, when other photographers pack up to await sunnier times. Not me. I have developed a system that allows me to stick it out as far as possible, often resulting in a winning photo.</p>

<p>In this case, I braced my trusty Gitzo 3541 with Really Right Stuff BH-55b ball-head low to the ground and hung my 30 pound (14 Kg) backpack from the hook under the center plate to stabilize it further (I always carry an assortment of carabiners for that, and other, purposes). I composed the image the way I wanted, placing the Church off-center and emphasizing the threatening clouds. I always use a cable release when shooting landscapes on a tripod, so I stepped to the side and shielded the camera from the wind as well as I could. Then I actually <strong>slowed</strong> down the shutter speed, so I could capture the blowing grasses in the foreground, adding a painterly feeling to the piece.</p>

<p>I like the resulting image, depicting the solidity of the church despite the storm, the angry clouds, the rim of mountains, and the softness of the grasses. Do you agree? Are there elements in the image you would have improved? Please feel free to be candid. I always enjoy another’s perspective.</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>I’m not sure what it is with old, junk cars. As photographers we seem to be drawn to them like flies to…</p>

<p>Okay, let’s start again. I spend a good amount of time in the woods and fields taking photographs and every so often I come across a great old junk car, peacefully rusting away. It’s irresistible. Snap, snap, hmmmn, maybe that angle or this one. Is it a metaphor for our own creaking, degenerating bodies? Is it the triumph of nature over machine? If you actually take the time to sit down and think about it, how on earth can a rusting hunk of junk hold attraction for anyone, let alone a nature/landscape/wildlife photographer?</p>

<p>Here’s a bunch that I’ve taken over the years. Maybe you can explain to me what the attraction is.</p>

<p>This last one really gets me. It&#8217;s an old joke to the natives of Maui, Hawaii. No one has ever been able to explain how this car got to the edge of this cliff. It would have had to drive over impossibly rough terrain and across small ravines to get there. Go figure!</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>Tomorrow I&#8217;m heading out for New Mexico for a week, four days of which I plan to spend trying out my well worn, but new to me 4x5 view camera. Never having used a view camera before, I&#8217;ve been practicing for the past few weeks. I&#8217;m pleased with my progress, even though it is slower than I would like, what with having to send every batch of film to the lab, wait for it to return, compare them to my notes and try again.</p>

<p>My main challenge has been nailing the correct exposures. I hope I&#8217;ve refined the process enough to take advantage of New Mexico&#8217;s beautiful landscapes. We&#8217;ll see.</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>I was reviewing some images this week in preparation for a presentation on my photography, when I came across this image. It sparked a memory that I’d like to share with you.</p>

<p><a href="http://blog.lesterpickerphoto.com/wp-content/uploads/2011/05/CanadianRockies2009-1482009-09-29-1.jpg"><img class="size-medium wp-image-1108" title="CanadianRockies2009 1482009-09-29 (1)" src="http://blog.lesterpickerphoto.com/wp-content/uploads/2011/05/CanadianRockies2009-1482009-09-29-1-300x198.jpg" alt="" width="300" height="198"></a></p>

<div class="mceTemp mceIEcenter"><dl id="attachment_1108" class="wp-caption aligncenter" style="width: 310px;">
<dd class="wp-caption-dd">Banff National Park</dd> </dl></div>


<p>I took this image at approximately an hour after sunset at the end of September in Banff National Park in Canada. (Please click on the image to enlarge it).</p>

<p>The other photographers I was with had packed up their gear at or shortly after sunset. Since it had just snowed and the meadow was so magically covered, I decided to linger and milk the scene for what it was worth. With digital, what did I have to lose?</p>

<p>So, I kept the aperture on my Nikon 17-35 f2.8 zoom at f11, ISO 100, and exposed on my tripod set low to the ground for 30 seconds. That gave an ethereal, blurry look to the clouds, which were moving at a pretty good clip. I also held a slight graduated neutral density filter across the sky portion because it was becoming so dark by then I knew that the foreground would become almost black if I didn’t hold back some of the fading light in the sky.</p>

<p>Now, I’m not saying that this image is going to win any awards, but I really like it and after all, isn’t that what the art of photography is really about? I especially like the clouds and the way the snow covered marsh grasses held the white color. I can still feel the bone chilling cold as I lay on the ground that evening (I had left my heavier jacket in the car), the total silence, and the cool, crisp mountain air.</p>

<p>My point in all this is simply to say that, at times, it pays to never give up. There are times I’ve packed up at a sunset and the sky suddenly flared up and I spewed all manner of expletives at my impatience. So, settle in, relax, enjoy the view. You might just catch that elusive moment.</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>If I had a dollar for every time I hear “Oh, you used a filter for that shot,” I’d be retired now, sipping Marguerites on a Pacific island. Of course, that comment is usually said disparagingly, often with a frown of distaste and typically in front of a woman hanging on to her man’s arm. She, naturally, nods approvingly, blissfully unaware of her husband’s profound ignorance. Happened to me again this week.</p>

<p>Many photographers use filters in ‘artistic’ ways in order to manipulate the scene to craft their unique vision. I may or may not like the specific result, but I always respect their visioning process.</p>

<p>In my work I simply cannot do that. Most magazines require that I shoot a scene as it appears, without enhancements. Yet I still use filters. How’s that?</p>

<p>The human eye is multiple times more sensitive than the finest digital sensors, able to discern light areas from dark, even different shades of dark within landscape shadows. If I were to simply meter on the shadows in the scene, I’d end up with an image in which the sky is what we call ‘overblown,’ meaning that there are no details in the bright areas of the scene. Conversely, if I meter on the brighter portions, the sensor screams ‘Hey, it’s too bright out there, close down the lens opening!’ As a result, the shadows in the scene are rendered so dark there is no detail within them. Trees, for example, will come out as black, featureless silhouettes, which might actually look nice in certain scenes. But frankly, my editors, or those who purchase my images for their homes and offices, would not be pleased if there are massive black areas with no discernible detail.</p>

<p>So, in those cases when I have huge expanses of sky and mountains and forest below, I use a special glass or resin filter known as a Graduated Neutral Density. Here is a photo of what it looks like.</p>

<p><a href="http://blog.lesterpickerphoto.com/wp-content/uploads/2011/05/Unknown.jpeg"><img class="size-full wp-image-1101" title="Unknown" src="http://blog.lesterpickerphoto.com/wp-content/uploads/2011/05/Unknown.jpeg" alt="" width="275" height="183"></a></p>

<p>The filter has a coating that reduces the light reaching certain areas of the sensor, while allowing full light to come through the rest, all without affecting the color of the scene. Pretty nifty, eh?</p>

<p>There are technical explanations for how this happens having to do with reducing the dynamic range of the scene, but it’s the results that matter, so I’ll skip the technical mumbo-jumbo in this blog. What the GND filter means is that my images are usually nicely balanced and I avoid blown out highlights, although sometimes you can’t avoid it no matter what you do. Here are some examples where I’ve used a GND filter, almost always when there is a large expanse of bright sky that I have to tame.</p>

<p><a href="http://blog.lesterpickerphoto.com/wp-content/uploads/2011/05/LAP5080-16x24.jpg"><img class="size-medium wp-image-1102" title="Martyr Bay, Victoria" src="http://blog.lesterpickerphoto.com/wp-content/uploads/2011/05/LAP5080-16x24-207x300.jpg" alt="" width="207" height="300"></a></p>

<p><a href="http://blog.lesterpickerphoto.com/wp-content/uploads/2011/05/CaRockies2009-Route-742-Spray-Lake-Kananaskis-country-7-of-11.jpg"><img class="size-medium wp-image-1103" title="CaRockies2009-Route 742-Spray Lake, Kananaskis country 7 of 11" src="http://blog.lesterpickerphoto.com/wp-content/uploads/2011/05/CaRockies2009-Route-742-Spray-Lake-Kananaskis-country-7-of-11-300x199.jpg" alt="" width="300" height="199"></a></p>

<p>Another filter I use a lot is a simple polarizing filter. This filter works like your polarizing sunglasses, only better. Once you screw in the filter, you just rotate the two pieces of glass as you look through the viewfinder and- voila!- magic happens. Clouds seem to almost pop out of the scene. The sky becomes crisp and clear. Distracting reflections disappear from water scenes and the reflections you want are emphasized.</p>

<p><a href="http://blog.lesterpickerphoto.com/wp-content/uploads/2011/05/Colorado-River-below-Glen-Canyon-Dam-87-of-205.jpg"><img class="size-medium wp-image-1104" title="Colorado River-below Glen Canyon Dam 87 of 205" src="http://blog.lesterpickerphoto.com/wp-content/uploads/2011/05/Colorado-River-below-Glen-Canyon-Dam-87-of-205-200x300.jpg" alt="" width="200" height="300"></a></p>

<p>Those are basically the only filters I use, and they are by no means inexpensive. I always recommend that you get the best filters (and lenses) you can afford, since everything we do in photography is done through glass (or resins). I personally use Singh-Ray (<a href="http://www.singh-ray.com">www.singh-ray.com</a>) and Lee (<a href="http://www.leefilters.com">www.leefilters.com</a>) filters.</p>

<p>Let us know what types of filters you prefer to use and how you put them to use in your photography. In the meantime, happy shooting!</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>I won’t refute charges that I am certifiably nuts, that I’ve finally gone over the precipice. After years of discussion, persuasion, debating and research, I finally bit the bullet and have invested in… drumroll here… Large Format Photography.</p>

<p>Yes, you read it right. I have taken at least three giant steps into the past- beyond digital, beyond 35mm film cameras- and joined the ranks of Matthew Brady and Ansel Adams. I’m now the anxious owner of an Arca Swiss 4x5 view camera, film and all.</p>

<p><a href="http://blog.lesterpickerphoto.com/wp-content/uploads/2011/05/LAP9163.jpg"><img class="aligncenter size-medium wp-image-1092" title="_LAP9163" src="http://blog.lesterpickerphoto.com/wp-content/uploads/2011/05/LAP9163-300x199.jpg" alt="" width="300" height="199"></a></p>

<p><a href="http://blog.lesterpickerphoto.com/wp-content/uploads/2011/05/LAP9164.jpg"><img class="aligncenter size-medium wp-image-1093" title="_LAP9164" src="http://blog.lesterpickerphoto.com/wp-content/uploads/2011/05/LAP9164-199x300.jpg" alt="" width="199" height="300"></a></p>

<p>We’re talking Neanderthal here:  manual focusing, manual setting of shutter speed and aperture, manual cocking of the shutter, manually inserting film into film loaders and then stuffing them into the back of the camera and stripping out the light-blocking shade and then reinserting it after the shutter is tripped.</p>

<p>Frankly, I was planning on tackling large format in 2012, but at the cajoling of my associate, Bob Boyer, I decided to bite the bullet immediately. This is the first in a series of blogs I hope to write over the next couple of years, reporting on my progress, or lack thereof. Bob has been doing my post-processing for the past couple of years, readying my digital images for traditional printing or, as client needs demand, for printing on aluminum, fiberboard or behind plexiglas.</p>

<p>Throughout this time, Bob’s sheer talent has gotten us by. He is able to extract every last pixel from my images so that we can enlarge them to the sizes our clients require, usually 20 x 30 or 24 x 36. But our clients have been clambering for ever larger images and the tipping point came last month when a client needed a 5-foot by 8-foot mural printed on a specialty medium. Bob pulled another rabbit out of his hat and the mural turned out every bit as good as we had hoped.</p>

<p><a href="http://blog.lesterpickerphoto.com/wp-content/uploads/2011/05/P1010202-1.jpg"><img class="size-medium wp-image-1094" title="P1010202-1" src="http://blog.lesterpickerphoto.com/wp-content/uploads/2011/05/P1010202-1-300x168.jpg" alt="" width="300" height="168"></a></p>

<p>The client loves it and restaurant patrons regularly comment on it. One patron said that she specifically brought her friend for lunch just to show her the image.</p>

<p>But, that last mural was the proverbial straw. It took so much effort to stretch the image from its native 12 mega-pixels. Now, depending on how the image is scanned, with that 4x5 transparency I’ll be able to get images with 100 MP, 250MP, 500MP or even 1 gigabit of information! Enlarging those will be a snap. Plus, there are other terrific advantages to shooting with a large format camera, but also some serious drawbacks. I’ll cover those, too, in future blogs.</p>

<p>For now, it’s back to the books, climbing the learning curve with my newest photo tool.</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>My assistant, Bob, and I took a break from the humdrum today and went out to the local state park to try out some metering techniques for my newest piece of equipment; a large format camera.</p>

<p>Me, I was dressed appropriately, being a landscape/wildlife photographer. We were going to a stream, so I wore boots with non-slip soles, rugged shirt and pants, and lots of insect repellent, etc. Bob is a consummate indoor fashion photographer. What does he know from traipsing in the woods? He had come from someplace else and was dressed in a white shirt, nice pants and flip-flops. Flip-flops! I mentioned something to him about it, but…</p>

<p>We walked down the embankment on a well-worn path. I stepped out onto a slippery rock in the stream and Bob was one step behind me when I heard a whoosh, thud, bone crunching on rock and a moan. Bob had slipped on the muddy rock and was down for the count.</p>

<p><a href="http://blog.lesterpickerphoto.com/wp-content/uploads/2011/05/HdG-Fall_2007-11-21_211%C2%A9LesterPicker.jpg"><img class="size-medium wp-image-1087 " title="HdG Fall_2007-11-21_211©LesterPicker" src="http://blog.lesterpickerphoto.com/wp-content/uploads/2011/05/HdG-Fall_2007-11-21_211%C2%A9LesterPicker-212x300.jpg" alt="" width="212" height="300"></a></p>

<p>White shirt no more, pants the color of muck, bloody hand and a big hurt all over his body. Can’t wait to hear how he feels when he gets up in the morning. We have a photo shoot of our most recent photo installation scheduled for tomorrow. We’ll see. I just hope he&#8217;s okay.</p>

<p>I admit to feelings of guilt over this incident. With my outdoor experience I should have warned Bob away from that spot. As the saying goes, foresight is better than hindsight by a darned sight!</p>

<p>Moral of the story: screw fashion, convention, and comfort. If you’re outside photographing and don’t look at least somewhat geeky, you’re not really a serious photographer&#8230; a serious <strong><em>outdoor</em></strong> photographer.  ‘Nuf said.</p>

<hr />

<p><strong>UPDATE</strong>: Bob is fine&#8230; sore and bruised, but he is back to work and as ornery as ever.</p>
