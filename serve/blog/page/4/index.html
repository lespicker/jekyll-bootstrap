  <div class="entry-content"><p>&#8220;As ye judge, so shall ye be judged.&#8221; I recall listening to a preacher ranting about this one night many years ago as I drove home from a late night dinner meeting with a client group. The preacher, obviously possessed by some otherworldly force, admonished us sinners about not judging others because we, in turn, would be judged by them.</p>

<p>I got to thinking about that a couple of days ago as I sat here in Maui, reviewing a previous day&#8217;s shoot. Trust me when I say that not very many of the images were winners. It was the wind, or maybe the rain, or maybeâ€¦ (ouch, could it have been ME?). In any case, I shrugged, laughed it off and moved on.</p>

<p><a href="http://blog.lesterpickerphoto.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/02/DSC_6330.jpg"><img class="size-medium wp-image-2622" title="DSC_6330" src="http://blog.lesterpickerphoto.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/02/DSC_6330-300x200.jpg" alt="" width="300" height="200"></a></p>

<p>I think there are two aspects of being a professional photographer that surprise most amateurs. The first is that we know when NOT to take a picture. I&#8217;ll see ten people lined up taking a shot and I know that with my particular camera-lens combo the shot just will not work, so why bother? The second characteristic of a pro is that we can shrug off a bad day and move on without beating ourselves up over it. Sure, we perform a post-mortem to avoid a repeat, but we accept that bad days, and bad images, happen.</p>

<p>Not so with many of my friends who tend to be too self-critical. I see this often in my workshops, where some people are reluctant to share their images because they feel they don&#8217;t measure up. Here is where I get back to the preacher.</p>

<p>I think most folks miss the deeper message contained in the quote. It&#8217;s not that if we judge others then others will judge us. I think it&#8217;s more like if we are the type of person who is judgmental, then we self-judge ourselves into a narrow corner. And that can be a hindrance to our development as a creative photographer.</p>

<p>So, I&#8217;m here to try to convince you to turn off the judge-o-meter. Take a second look at that image. What is there to like about it? What did you do right? Okay, so the image is way too dark in the foreground, but is the composition done well? If so, let&#8217;s learn from it. What can you do to lighten the foreground while not blowing out the sky in the background? I&#8217;m sure you get the point.</p>

<p><a href="http://blog.lesterpickerphoto.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/02/A0024674.jpg"><img class="size-medium wp-image-2623" title="A0024674" src="http://blog.lesterpickerphoto.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/02/A0024674-300x225.jpg" alt="" width="300" height="225"></a></p>

<p>As a photographer, I have seen so many images hanging on walls, some of them quite pricey, that I frankly do not like. But if it gives someone pleasure, that&#8217;s the name of the game. I personally love Degas, Renoir, Monet. I don&#8217;t get Picasso. So when I&#8217;m at a museum and I&#8217;m confronted with a Picasso, it forces me to look deeper, at the lines, the colors, the shapes. Pretty soon I get a taste of what people appreciate. Not the whole meal, mind you, but a taste.</p>

<p>Will you try it? Shut down the constricted judgments. Open up to new possibilities.</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>Maui, Hawaii in February can mean only one thing- the whales are in town. Specifically, this is the time that thousands of humpbacks are in full force in Maui, frolicking in the protected area between Maui and the nearby islands of Lanai and Molokai (as well as others). And what a sight they are to behold.</p>

<p><a href="http://blog.lesterpickerphoto.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/02/DSC_5993.jpg"><img class="size-medium wp-image-2612" title="DSC_5993" src="http://blog.lesterpickerphoto.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/02/DSC_5993-300x200.jpg" alt="" width="300" height="200"></a></p>

<p>Stand on any beach from Kapalua to Wailea for more than five minutes and if you don&#8217;t see at least a dozen blows, fin slaps, and breeches you are facing away from the ocean. This federally protected area is where humpbacks come to birth calves or to breed for next year&#8217;s arrival. These whales, the size of a school bus (up to fifty feet in length) do not eat while they are here for up to five months. Instead they live on their body fat and can lose up to a third of their weight while they are here.</p>

<p><a href="http://blog.lesterpickerphoto.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/02/DSC_6046.jpg"><img class="size-medium wp-image-2613" title="DSC_6046" src="http://blog.lesterpickerphoto.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/02/DSC_6046-300x200.jpg" alt="" width="300" height="200"></a></p>

<p>Females form pods that protect any young within their care. Nearby groups of males will stage competition &#8220;battles&#8221; of pectoral fin and tail slaps, lunges and breeches to declare themselves king of the pack and desirable for nearby females. If they had a talent agent we&#8217;d be watching &#8220;Whales Gone Wild&#8221; on cable.</p>

<p>Every day, from sunrise to sunset, the whale tourism industry here in Maui caters to thousands of tourists who simply want to see these majestic animals in their breeding home. Perhaps the best known, and whose boats I use, is the Pacific Whale Foundation. They are a nonprofit whose funding goes to support whale research and educational programs. Hats off to them for the wonderful job they do educating us all on the glories and challenges of these magnificent creatures.</p>

<p>My first two trips were learning experiences for me, as I tried out a new setup. One of the trips was on an inflatable dinghy and ocean conditions made it difficult to photograph. Think of the fact that the vessel is pitching, rolling and yawing, the whales are moving, the wind is blowing and you&#8217;ve got to place an autofocus sensor dot on a creature 100 or more yards away (I am experimenting with other focus techniques, but my training keeps pulling me back to spot focus). I can&#8217;t say I&#8217;m happy with the results so far, but I have two more cruises left this year.</p>

<p><a href="http://blog.lesterpickerphoto.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/02/DSC_6493.jpg"><img class="size-medium wp-image-2614" title="DSC_6493" src="http://blog.lesterpickerphoto.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/02/DSC_6493-300x200.jpg" alt="" width="300" height="200"></a></p>

<p>In any event, here is my setup: Nikon D800 with either a 200-400mm or 70-200 lens. I mount the 200-400 on a monopod and hand-hold the 70-200. Depending on the light I am shooting at ISO 400 or 800 so I can have a <em>minimum</em> shutter speed of 1/1000 second. I shoot with an exposure adjustment of +2/3 stop so that the black body of the whales will not render totally featureless. I will sometimes use a 1.4x tele-extender, but I don&#8217;t like to do that because it restricts my vision and I miss too many shots. I&#8217;d rather wait until the captain pulls the boat closer (but boats here are restricted to 100 yards). Needless to say, this is not the situation to use filters.</p>

<p>I&#8217;m offering this not as a whale photography expert, but as a starting point for those of you just getting into it. There is one more issue I plan to talk about with whale photography, but I&#8217;ll have to wait until next week when my last two cruises are done. Stay tuned!</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>I found a really sweet stream on Maui, about an hour from my hotel. But when I visited it this morning, it started to rain just as I got set up, so I&#8217;ll return at least once more to try again. The challenge is that this stream is in a generally wet part of the island and today the stream was swollen. I had to wade into it to get the shot, but if it&#8217;s much higher on my next visit I&#8217;m not sure I&#8217;ll be able to access the same spot.</p>

<p><a href="http://blog.lesterpickerphoto.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/02/A0024557.jpg"><img class="alignnone size-medium wp-image-2605" title="A0024557" src="http://blog.lesterpickerphoto.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/02/A0024557-300x225.jpg" alt="" width="300" height="225"></a></p>

<p>The saving grace is that the water is delightfully cool, perfect for water sandals. It&#8217;s very meditative, too.</p>

<p>I promised to give more technical info to you in 2013, so here goes. I used my Gitzo 3541 tripod with a Really Right Stuff BH-55 ballhead with quick release. I mounted my Hasselblad H4D-50, with a 28mm lens. I mounted my HTS1.5 tilt-shift attachment to the lens, effectively making the lens a 42mm medium format lens. That translates to about a 33mm lens in typical 35mm format. I used the tilt-shift to get good depth-of-field from foreground to background.</p>

<p>I shot at f11 and ISO 50. Now, it was pretty dark in that stream, since it sits in a valley and it was raining. To slow the water down I left on my polarizer and added a Singh-Ray 5-stop Neutral Density filter. That brought the shutter speed all the way up to 16 seconds. Here is what my setup looked like (just ignore the legs) before I had to wade deeper.</p>

<p><a href="http://blog.lesterpickerphoto.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/02/photo.jpg"><img class="size-medium wp-image-2607" title="photo" src="http://blog.lesterpickerphoto.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/02/photo-e1360788033315-225x300.jpg" alt="" width="225" height="300"></a></p>

<p>Â </p>

<p>The fact is that I planned to do vertical and horizontal panos of the stream, but the rain put a quick end to that plan. As soon as I get the shot nailed in good weather (how&#8217;s that for positive thinking?!), I&#8217;ll post it here, so stay tuned. I also plan to comparison shoot with my Nikon D800 and I&#8217;ll do that as a separate post. In the meantime, I hope the rain gods take a well deserved rest.</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>I took this image two days ago while on the south side of Maui. The sun was fading fast and I ran out of my car, clamped my camera to the tripod and shot almost directly into the sun (the sun is a few degrees to the left). I held my hand to the side of the camera to avoid flare. The image you see here is straight out of the camera, with no post-processing, converted to a jpg for posting here on my blog.</p>

<p><a href="http://blog.lesterpickerphoto.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/02/A0024317-11.jpg"><img class="size-medium wp-image-2602" title="A0024317-1" src="http://blog.lesterpickerphoto.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/02/A0024317-11-300x225.jpg" alt="" width="300" height="225"></a></p>

<p>What appealed to me was the compositional arrangement of four horizontal slices of landscape. It was very windy, so I used a .5 second exposure to allow the grasses in the foreground to soften, although in retrospect I probably should have slowed it down even more.</p>

<p>In any event, here is what I&#8217;m asking: before I go through all the trouble of post-processing, do you think the image is worth the work? Is it salvageable? What would you suggest I do in post? Or, is it one of those all-too-typical situations of an image in the eye not quite rendering as you saw it, so culling it, grieving the loss and moving on is the best option. Watcha think?</p>

<p>Thanks in advance.</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>Most people know the route as the Road to Hana. But what about the return trip, what I call the Road From Hana? Sure, many people simply turn around at Hana and drive back as they came, and there&#8217;s nothing wrong with that. The views are magnificent as I described in <a href="http://blog.lesterpickerphoto.com/2013/02/07/the-road-to-hana-part-i/">yesterday&#8217;s blog</a>.</p>

<p>But there is another way to return from a visit to glorious Hana. Just keep driving clockwise, following the shore road. At first your journey is familiar, passing through deep foliage and waterfalls. But then the vistas open up as you pass farmland and eventually open terrain that give you unobstructed views of mighty, cloud shrouded Haleakala.</p>

<p><a href="http://blog.lesterpickerphoto.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/02/A0024292-Edit.jpg"><img class="size-medium wp-image-2594  " title="A0024292-Edit" src="http://blog.lesterpickerphoto.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/02/A0024292-Edit-300x225.jpg" alt="" width="300" height="225"></a></p>

<p>Make no mistake about it, the road is rough, with a 5-mile stretch that is mostly gravel. The road immediately after Hana narrows to 1-1/2 lanes and if a car is coming from the opposite direction, one of you will have to pull over into a turnout to allow the other to get by. The road is twisty, too, but the views are utterly jaw-dropping.</p>

<h3>Iconic Stops</h3>


<p>Perhaps the most iconic stops en route back to Kahului from Hana are at The Seven Sacred Pools and the Waimoku Falls hike. The Pools are located within Haleakala National Park, so there is a $10 admission Â fee. This place is well worth a stop and a photo hike. First, for the record, the Pools were so named in modern times by an engaging entrepreneur who felt that the real name, O&#8217;heo Gulch, was not exactly a turn-on to visitors. No matter, this place is a photographer&#8217;s paradise in the right weather. Unfortunately, on this visit the weather did not cooperate for me, so I can&#8217;t share an image. What you will see is a series of pools leading from the rugged ocean shore to a series of exceptionally picturesque cascading waterfalls. The view can bring tears, but you need to get there by mid-morning to avoid the crowds. You&#8217;ll want a medium tele and a longer tele to do this scene justice. If you want to shoot from the pools themselves, be very careful. You may want a moderate wide angle to take in both the foreground and the waterfall Â and bridge which tower above you.</p>

<p>The hike to Waimoku Falls is one of the premier hikes on Maui (my favorite is the Haleakala Crater hike). I would categorize it as a strenuous hike for photographers, mainly because we carry so much gear. You will need a good backback to store gear because if the waterfall is running full you will have to ford two roaring streams. You cannot boulder hop them. You will get your feet wet, so hike in boots and bring along water shoes.</p>

<p>Is it worth it? How does a 400-foot tall straight drop waterfall sound? A waterfall so voluminous it creates its own wind!</p>

<p><a href="http://blog.lesterpickerphoto.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/02/A0024256.jpg"><img class="size-medium wp-image-2597" title="A0024256" src="http://blog.lesterpickerphoto.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/02/A0024256-225x300.jpg" alt="" width="225" height="300"></a></p>

<p>On this 2-mile uphill hike you will also encounter a majestic banyan tree (.5 mile mark) that begs to be photographed. Then you enter a magical bamboo forest (1 mile mark) that demands reverential attention. Then you ford two streams and finally you have earned the right to capture Waimoku on film or card.</p>

<p>A couple of hints for this hike:</p>

<ol>
<li><p>Start early. We passed some jokers who started their hike when we were coming back at 4:30. Â This can actually be dangerous as the bamboo forest starts to get dark by then. Hiking down after 5:30 can be a serious mistake.</p></li>
<li><p>Wear good shoes and bring water shoes with you.</p></li>
<li><p>Plan to spend at least 4 hours if you are a photographer; perhaps 6 hours if you are a serious photographer.</p></li>
<li><p>Carry a wide angle and a medium tele or macro-tele combo. You can leave the long lens in the hotel as you are almost in the waterfall when you finally get to it.</p></li>
<li><p>Bring lunch and plenty of water with you.</p></li>
<li><p>Celebrate every moment of this hike.</p></li>
</ol>


<p>Â </p>

<p>Â </p>

<p>The final stretch along the Pi&#8217;ilani Highway offers radically different views of Maui, from fields of cattle to sweeping views of the coast on one side and Haleakala on the other. Enough eye candy to cause an extreme high!</p>

<p>So, please don&#8217;t rush. Drive slowly, stop often, and exercise that trigger finger.</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>My guess is that few travelers have not heard of The Road to Hana. It is consistently rated one of the most wondrous drives in the world, and with good reason. This 40 mile, curvy, narrow road snakes along Maui, Hawaii&#8217;s northeast shore, blessing motorists with one eye-candy scene after another. Look toward the Pacific and you see craggy coastlines being pounded by 30-foot waves. Look inland and you see spectacular waterfalls every few miles.</p>

<p><a href="http://blog.lesterpickerphoto.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/02/A0024099.jpg"><img class="size-medium wp-image-2588" title="A0024099" src="http://blog.lesterpickerphoto.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/02/A0024099-300x225.jpg" alt="" width="300" height="225"></a></p>

<p>The bamboo forests afford tons of opportunities for macro photography.</p>

<p><a href="http://blog.lesterpickerphoto.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/02/A0024246.jpg"><img class="size-medium wp-image-2589" title="A0024246" src="http://blog.lesterpickerphoto.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/02/A0024246-300x225.jpg" alt="" width="300" height="225"></a></p>

<p>This is a drive that forces you to slow down, although locals won&#8217;t even think twice of passing you going twice the speed limit around a curve. Of course the speed limit is mostly 15MPH, but most drivers learn to breath and relax on the drive. Cliff diving in a car doesn&#8217;t sound very attractive. The drive takes maybe two hours, but for a photographer, better count on at least double that.</p>

<p><a href="http://blog.lesterpickerphoto.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/02/A00242091.jpg"><img class="size-medium wp-image-2590" title="A0024209" src="http://blog.lesterpickerphoto.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/02/A00242091-225x300.jpg" alt="" width="225" height="300"></a></p>

<p>If you plan to do the Hana drive and then get back to Kihei, Kahului or Lahaina the same day, Â my advice is- don&#8217;t do it. You&#8217;ll just frustrate yourself. Instead, do what I did this past week; take a full day to drive to Hana, spend the night, and then either backtrack the next day, or else complete the loop by driving back along the spectacular Pi&#8217;ilani Highway (more on that tomorrow).</p>

<p>Â </p>

<p>Hotel Hana</p>

<p>For more years than I care to remember, I&#8217;ve wanted to stay at the Hotel Hana, the venerable resort that was recently acquired and renamed Travaasa (what the heck??). So on this visit to Maui I scheduled an overnight stay, so I could take my time and stop wherever I wanted en route to and from this neat town. If you can swing it, a visit to Travaasa is well worth it, although we could only sample a tiny slice of what they offer in a one-night stay.</p>

<p>Travaasa is located in a drop-dead gorgeous location. All cabins have Pacific Ocean views. There&#8217;s a world-class spa, wellness center, horseback riding, hikes and more. Do as much or as little as you want. On our evening we hiked the shoreline to snag this beautiful sunset, taken from their property.</p>

<p>Â </p>

<p>These images were taken on the road going to Hana and at Hana. In tomorrow&#8217;s blog I&#8217;ll discuss the drive back along the south and interior roads of the island.</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>It&#8217;s probably an impossibility for a photographer to come all the way to Kauai and not hike the Kalalau Trail along the famed Na Pali coast. And with good reason. The coast is one of the most spectacular scenics on Earth. I imagine that every adult in North America has seen at least one image of Na Pali.</p>

<p>There are three ways to see the Na Pali coast; helicopter, boat and hiking. Each has its advantages and disadvantages for photographers. Helicopters, for example, are expensive, last a short time and you have to get the right type of bird and sit in the right seat to come home with the bacon. In this case the right seat means that literally. Since the helicopters must fly clockwise around the island, the right-hand seat fares the best. If the weather cooperates, you can snag some spectacular images of Na Pali from the air.</p>

<p>Boats are typically a seasonal thing, with summer weather yielding calmer seas. In winter boats are a chancy bet. You also have to use a fast shutter speed and higher ISO to get crisp, clean shots.</p>

<p>So, for me at least, hiking offers some attractive options. First, it costs next to nothing. You can take a tripod with you and you have a stable platform. The views are restricted, however. And, like any other way to get there, this one is weather dependent. There is also another <em><strong>major</strong></em>Â drawback. The hike is not an easy one., so be forewarned.</p>

<p>I climbed to a viewpoint at the 7/10 mile mark today. It was a beautiful day, having been dry for the past couple of days. The trail was still slippery in spots. I lugged my LowePro backpack stuffed with my Hasselblad H4D-50, 50-110mm lens, 28mm with HTS 1.5 tilt-shift, Gitzo 3541 tripod with Really Right Stuff BH-55 ballhead and leveling base, and assorted (all too heavy) paraphernalia&#8230; and water. That&#8217;s not chump change, at least not for me!</p>

<p><a href="http://blog.lesterpickerphoto.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/02/A0023953.jpg"><img class="size-medium wp-image-2582" title="A0023953" src="http://blog.lesterpickerphoto.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/02/A0023953-300x225.jpg" alt="" width="300" height="225"></a></p>

<p>The shot here was taken with the 50-110 @ 80mm, ISO 50, 1/5 second, f16. I used a polarizing filter to cut as much of the haze as possible and a 2-stop neutral density filter for part of the sky and to try to accentuate the moon on the far right side. I did take several images at 110mm so the moon was larger in the scene.</p>

<p>Here are some pointers for those of you attempting the hike for the first time. Bring water. Wear hiking shoes (no flip flops, as so many idiots, usually ages 16-25, do). Use a polarizer, as it is usually hazy. Do not go if it is raining; the trail can be dangerously slippery. Wear sunscreen. If you intend to do the 8-mile round trip to the waterfall, leave early. Have fun!</p>

<p>If you have specific questions about the hike, feel free to leave a comment and I&#8217;ll respond.</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>I&#8217;m excited to announce the winners of our <a href="http://blog.lesterpickerphoto.com/2012/12/02/bird-photography-contest/">First Annual Bird Photography Contest</a>. We instituted this contest for two reasons; first to tip our hats to the dedicated birders of the Annual Christmas Bird Count who help us gauge the health of our natural environment, and second to give credit to bird photographers everywhere. I acknowledge their skills and perseverance precisely because I am so damned bad at it!</p>

<p>There were supposed to be First, Second and Third place awards, but we had a hard time choosing the Second place winner, so in the end we are giving four awards from the many submissions. What great images! This contest was tough to judge, but I&#8217;ll give you an idea of why we chose these winners. Here, then, are the recipients, along with some words from them. C<em>lick on the images to see larger versions.Â </em></p>

<p><a href="http://blog.lesterpickerphoto.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/01/loon-feeding-chick-July2010-363.jpeg"><img class="size-medium wp-image-2568" title="loon-feeding-chick-July2010-363" src="http://blog.lesterpickerphoto.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/01/loon-feeding-chick-July2010-363-300x231.jpeg" alt="" width="300" height="231"></a></p>

<p><strong>First Place</strong> goes to Keith Carver who took this wonderful image on Damariscotta Lake in Maine. What struck us about this image is the intimacy of the mother feeding a crayfish to her chick. Better yet, Keith chose to crop out the extraneous parts of the image to focus on its essence (see my blog on <a href="http://blog.lesterpickerphoto.com/2012/11/08/finding-the-essence/">essence</a>). I love how elegant it is in its simplicity, with the somewhat overblown, featureless water drawing the viewers&#8217; eyes to the focal point. That turns a mere bird identification photo into a magical story. &#8220;It was taken in early July, 2010 on Damariscotta Lake,&#8221; Keith tells us. &#8220;Cropped to about 60% of theÂ <a href="http://krcarver.zenfolio.com/p896543188/h29ce259#h29ce259">full frame image</a>. Â The chick was about three weeks old at the time, and survived the snappers and herring gulls to grow to a grayish teenager by late September when I last saw him.&#8221;</p>

<p>Photo details: Â Canon EOS 1D Mk III, 500 mm IS with 1.4X extender (700 mm), 1/1250 sec, f/5.6, ISO 400, Aperture priority, exposure bias +1 stop</p>

<p><strong>Second Prizes</strong> go to John Sternbergh for his Tanzanian Red-Billed Hornbill eating a frog and to Andy Anderson for his capture of an osprey in flight with a fish in its talons.</p>

<p>Â </p>

<p><a href="http://blog.lesterpickerphoto.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/01/Red-billed-Hornbill-John-Sternbergh.jpg"><img class="size-medium wp-image-2570" title="Red-billed Hornbill - John Sternbergh" src="http://blog.lesterpickerphoto.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/01/Red-billed-Hornbill-John-Sternbergh-300x225.jpg" alt="" width="300" height="225"></a></p>

<p>In John&#8217;s image, talk about being in the right place at the right time and with the right equipment! What we liked about this image is the action and the tack-sharp eye of the hornbill (with a slight catch-light to boot!).</p>

<p>Photo details: Nikon D700, AF-S VR Nikkor 200-400mm @ 330mm, f5.6, 1/200, -1.67EV, ISO 200</p>

<p>Â </p>

<p><a href="http://blog.lesterpickerphoto.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/01/Osprey1.jpg"><img class="size-medium wp-image-2571" title="Osprey1" src="http://blog.lesterpickerphoto.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/01/Osprey1-300x214.jpg" alt="" width="300" height="214"></a></p>

<p>Andy&#8217;s image captured the action of the osprey with an alewife in its talons. Note the sharp eye and the talons dug into the hapless fish. As Andy tells it:</p>

<p>&#8220;This is a photo of an osprey carrying off an alwive taken in Orland, Maine, on the saltwater side of the dam. My wife and I went there on my motorcycle because we heard from one of her patients (she&#8217;s a nurse) that the ospreys were hunting in the deep pool at the base of the fish ladder. Â One or two would hang out on this tall dead tree nearby and watch for an opportunity for a free lunch. Â At the time, I was using a Nikon D200, with a Nikon 70-300mm f/4.5-5.6.&#8221;</p>

<p>The <strong>Third Place</strong> image could have placed First in virtually any competition. Michael Allie&#8217;s Great-Horned Owl is striking in its pose, its in-your-face stare, its tack sharpness and its surroundings to give context. The only thing that held it back in this competition was my proclivity for images that tell stories or show action.</p>

<p><a href="http://blog.lesterpickerphoto.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/01/MDA_6014.jpg"><img class="size-medium wp-image-2572" title="MDA_6014" src="http://blog.lesterpickerphoto.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/01/MDA_6014-300x198.jpg" alt="" width="300" height="198"></a></p>

<p>Photo details: Nikon D7000, Tamron 70-300MM lens at 217mm, ISO 800, f7.1, 1/1250.</p>

<p>We also wanted to extend an Honorable Mention to Danny Pickens for his image of a Night Heron trying to tempt his mate. Keep up the good work, Danny, and submit another one for next year&#8217;s contest.</p>

<p><a href="http://blog.lesterpickerphoto.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/01/IMG_0362a1.jpg"><img class="size-medium wp-image-2574" title="Yellow-Crowned Night Heron" src="http://blog.lesterpickerphoto.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/01/IMG_0362a1-300x200.jpg" alt="" width="300" height="200"></a></p>

<p>Thanks to all who submitted images to the contest and a hearty congrats to our winners. Like I always say, judging these contests is terribly subjective and does not in any way reflect on the quality of those images not selected.</p>

<p><em><strong>Now a note to the winners</strong></em>: I am in Hawaii right now and won&#8217;t be back until Feb 26. I will contact you all individually shortly after my return with information about the prizes. Thanks for your patience. Feel free to contact me as I will have email throughout.</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>It was late in the day when I decided to check out the Waimea Canyon drive. I was actually on my way to a beach to photograph sunset, but I did a quick detour because I hadn&#8217;t been up the mountain in 5 years. Waimea Canyon is known as the Grand Canyon of the Pacific, and while the moniker is worthy, the visual comparison is not. Imagine the Grand Canyon with lush green accents and sheer cliffs leading to the Pacific Ocean. Within the Waimea Canyon State Park is Mount Wai&#8217;ale&#8217;ale, considered the wettest place on Earth, with an average of 452 inches of rain a year and a record of 683! That is why the Park has some spectacular waterfalls.</p>

<p>The first overlook was socked in with fog, so we drove a bit further and I took some quick snaps of the Pacific side of the canyon. The clouds come in from the ocean and hit the cliffs and swirl around in a mesmerizing dance. At times you are totally enveloped in clouds, which is a wonderful sensory experience, although if you are standing on the edge of a cliff you&#8217;d better stay still until it clears. Here is a sample. I&#8217;ll plan to go back later this week and spend more quality time there, weather permitting.</p>

<p><a href="http://blog.lesterpickerphoto.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/01/A0023790.jpg"><img class="alignnone size-medium wp-image-2565" title="A0023790" src="http://blog.lesterpickerphoto.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/01/A0023790-300x225.jpg" alt="" width="300" height="225"></a></p>

<p>Â </p>

<p>BTW, that &#8220;little&#8221; detour ending up costing me the sunrise, as I raced (well, you don&#8217;t actually race in Hawaii, where the top speed limit is 50 mph) the setting sun and ending up on the losing end. Like I said, there&#8217;s always next time.</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>I recall cruising on board a small ship in the Galapagos on one of my trips there. Each morning our wonderful tour guide, a local, would waken the 16 passengers with the following announcement: &#8220;Good morning everyone. Welcome to another beautiful day in paradise.&#8221; And to an ecologist like myself, the Galapagos islands are truly a paradise.</p>

<p>But, make no mistake about it. The Galapagos islands are hardly tropical paradises. For that, you have to go to the Hawaiian Islands and, more specifically, Kauai, the Garden Island. Next to the Arctic and sub-Arctic climes that I love, Kauai and Maui are two of my favorite places. We arrived three days ago and we&#8217;ve already covered several of my favorite sunrise and sunset spots.</p>

<p>It took only a day for Kauai&#8217;s magic to work its way into our soul. It&#8217;s a magical stew, here. First there is the eye candy of verdant valleys and soaring cliffs and banks of the most luscious clouds imaginable. Then there are the sounds of the ocean ebbing and flowing and pounding at the island that was ironically formed from the sea.</p>

<p>There is also the island lifestyle; speed limits mostly are 25-35mph, with occasional reckless 50 mph stretches. There is the Aloha spirit and everyone still says mahalo (thank you). We talked with an employee at Costco here who acknowledged that, yes, costs are high and sadly wages are low but, hey, that&#8217;s the price of living in paradise. You don&#8217;t eat out much, but the trade-off is worth it.</p>

<p><a href="http://blog.lesterpickerphoto.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/01/A0023737.jpg"><img class="alignnone size-medium wp-image-2561" title="A0023737" src="http://blog.lesterpickerphoto.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/01/A0023737-300x225.jpg" alt="" width="300" height="225"></a></p>

<p>On our first full day in Kauai I drove to the base of the Na Pali coast. It had rained heavily the previous two days so I decided to stay through sunset and was treated to a magnificent scene looking down the silhouetted Na Pali coastline. The waves were thunderous, cresting at 20-30 feet, another demonstration of nature&#8217;s awesome power.</p>

<p>Now it&#8217;s on to other island adventures before we take off for Maui and some of its treasures. Stay tuned!</p>
