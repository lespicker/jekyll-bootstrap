  <div class="entry-content"><p>I have to run this one by you all. I recently tried to make reservations at a pricey B&amp;B in Brookline, Massachusetts. It seems like a very nice, comfortable B&amp;B, judging by their website. I’ll be visiting my stepson, daughter-in-law and newest grandson and the B&amp;B looked pretty convenient. After giving the very pleasant woman my credit card info, I was ready to hang up, when she asked if I knew their cancellation policy. Well, no, I guess I didn’t.</p>

<p><a href="http://blog.lesterpickerphoto.com/wp-content/uploads/2011/07/Dylan1.jpg"><img class="size-medium wp-image-1312" title="Dylan1" src="http://blog.lesterpickerphoto.com/wp-content/uploads/2011/07/Dylan1-199x300.jpg" alt="" width="199" height="300"></a></p>

<p>“We have a 14-day cancellation policy, for any reason,” she tells me. Silence on both ends.</p>

<p>“What, exactly, does that mean?” I finally asked.</p>

<p>“If you don’t cancel before the 14-day period, we will charge your credit card for the full amount.”</p>

<p>“You mean for both days?” I asked, incredulous. This B&amp;B does not sport Motel 6 prices, BTW.</p>

<p>“So, even if there is a medical emergency,” I continue, “I would lose all my money?”</p>

<p>“I’m sorry, but I’m afraid so.”  At which point I cancelled the transaction.</p>

<p>Now, I’d love your opinion on this. Am I being unreasonable here?  I’ve been a travel photojournalist for twenty years and I’ve never run into this before. Is this an emerging trend? Is this a put-your-customer-first policy? Please, weigh in.</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>I get asked this question frequently at workshops and from you readers online. People wonder what software I regularly use and what websites I regularly visit. So, here goes.</p>

<h3>Please, No PhotoShop!</h3>


<p>I came into digital photography kicking and screaming in my fifties. I started by trying to climb the learning curve with Photoshop on my PC. Now for those of you who use Photoshop regularly and expertly, my hats are off to you. But after a few months of diligently studying and experimenting, I found I was taking way too much time off from being in the field photographing and did not enjoy the convoluted Photoshop layering process. But that’s just me. Perhaps if I were 10… make that 20… years younger.</p>

<h3>Mac Attack!</h3>


<p>I soon switched my entire system to Apple and now own a high-end Mac desktop, a 15” MacBook Pro laptop and a 13” MacBook Air for the field, along with the latest iPod Touch (can’t live without that little baby!). The switch to Apple simplified my life and not only wouldn’t I ever go back to a PC, but I wish I had made the switch years earlier (maybe then I’d be an expert on PhotoShop).</p>

<p>With the switch, I decided to try Apple’s Aperture and I’ve never looked back. Aperture, now in Version 3.1, is a high-end post-processing program by Apple which I always keep updated. Aperture, like its Adobe counterpart, Lightroom, does 80-90 percent of what I need in post-processing. What it cannot do to my satisfaction, I find I can accomplish using several very fine plug-ins that I use without ever exiting Aperture.</p>

<p><a href="http://blog.lesterpickerphoto.com/wp-content/uploads/2011/07/aperture3-165.png"><img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-1308" title="aperture3-165" src="http://blog.lesterpickerphoto.com/wp-content/uploads/2011/07/aperture3-165.png" alt="" width="165" height="120"></a></p>

<h3>Nik Software</h3>


<p>All my plug-ins, with one exception, are made by Nik Software. I use Color Efex Pro for maybe five of its effects, and even then sparingly. Silver Efex Pro comes into play for my black &amp; white conversions and Viveza for fine local adjustments. They are all 64-bit and I never have to leave Aperture (also 64-bit) to use them.</p>

<p><a href="http://blog.lesterpickerphoto.com/wp-content/uploads/2011/07/coco_linklist_banner_small.jpg"><img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-1307" title="coco_linklist_banner_small" src="http://blog.lesterpickerphoto.com/wp-content/uploads/2011/07/coco_linklist_banner_small.jpg" alt="" width="190" height="180"></a></p>

<p>I will also use Define, Nik’s de-noise program, although not very frequently since most of my images are shot at ISO 100 or 200, so I don’t have to deal much with noise.</p>

<p>I also use Nik NX2 for certain specific images, now that Bob Boyer (<a href="http://photo.rwboyer.com">http://photo.rwboyer.com) </a>convincingly demonstrated to me that Aperture does not do an accurate job of translating some green tones from in-camera to computer. The greens are too yellow, so if I have a very verdant green scene, I might use NX2 to input.</p>

<h3>PhotoMatix</h3>


<p>The exception to my Nik-only software add-ons is that I sometimes- and I mean very seldom- use PhotoMatix for HDR. When I first started using PM, I overused it, like many of my colleagues. It is a very cool technology and I found myself mesmerized by its capabilities. However, after I let some of those ‘5-star’ images sit for a while, I came back and wondered what I had been drinking when I processed them. Nowadays I dislike probably 90% of HDR images. When I use it lately, it is with a very, very light touch.</p>

<p>PM makes a plug-in for Aperture so, once again, I don’t have to leave the program to use it. I just highlight the 3 or 5 images I want to use for the HDR process, click on the PM bar and away she goes. In 30 seconds or less I have my completed image, ready for fine-tuning back in Aperture.</p>

<p>One note of caution, though. Bob Boyer and I have found a horrendous bug in the newest version of PhotoMatix (version 4). The program shows a preview that is crisp and sharp, but once it is finally rendered, it comes out fuzzy and soft. We have sent two rounds of detailed emails to them, but they do not seem to understand the issue. I guess we’ll keep trying, but if anyone else is having this issue, please let me know.</p>

<h3>Full Disclosure</h3>


<p>In the interests of fair and full disclosure, I have to say that there are times when I have to produce big prints for my clients (and I do mean b-i-g, as in 5 feet by 9 feet!). In those cases, Bob takes my files and uses Perfect Resize 7 by onOne Software. Bob is also an expert in PhotoShop and will sometimes work his magic with it when readying my images for printing. I have no idea what he does in those cases. I just approve the final product.</p>

<h3>PTGUI</h3>


<p>I’ve only recently begun to do panoramas and I have just started using PTGUI for that work. I love its ease-of-use and its clean output.</p>

<h3>Backup</h3>


<p>For backups I have an advanced system to accommodate my paranoia about losing my entire business. That’s why I keep secure backups both on- and off-site, as well as when I’m in the field. For details you can visit my previous blog on the topic (<a href="http://blog.lesterpickerphoto.com/2009/06/02/backing-up-your-digital-images/">http://blog.lesterpickerphoto.com/2009/06/02/backing-up-your-digital-images/). </a>Just read it with caution because it will cost you some bucks to replicate and it’s a pain in the rear to discipline yourself to do the monthly backup.</p>

<p>There you have it, that’s what’s in my computer. Now let’s be fair. I’ve shown you mine; you have to show us yours! Please share with readers of this blog what photo software you use and why.</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>As the summer travel season heats up, there has recently been a lot of discussion on safety issues when traveling abroad. Some commentary focuses on personal (bodily) safety and other on property safety. I recently pointed my readers to an article (<a href="http://www.consumertraveler.com/columns/traveling-to-europe-this-summer-keep-your-camera-equipment-and-valuables-safe/">http://www.consumertraveler.com/columns/traveling-to-europe-this-summer-keep-your-camera-equipment-and-valuables-safe/</a>) by one of my colleagues at Nikonians.org concerning keeping your equipment safe while traveling.</p>

<p><a href="http://blog.lesterpickerphoto.com/wp-content/uploads/2011/07/Unknown.jpeg"><img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-1301" title="Unknown" src="http://blog.lesterpickerphoto.com/wp-content/uploads/2011/07/Unknown.jpeg" alt="" width="106" height="96"></a></p>

<p>As it turns out, I was asked to do a companion piece on equipment travel safety from my own personal experiences as a travel photojournalist for the blog site of Darwin Wiggett. For those of you who follow my blog, you know that I am an admirer of Darwin&#8217;s work. Darwin is a Canadian landscape photographer with a singular vision of our natural world.</p>

<p>So, if you&#8217;d like my take on how to keep your photo equipment safe while traveling, visit Darwin&#8217;s blog here: <a href="http://darwinwiggett.wordpress.com/2011/07/16/keeping-your-equipment-safe-by-les-picker/">http://darwinwiggett.wordpress.com/2011/07/16/keeping-your-equipment-safe-by-les-picker/</a></p>

<p>And, while you&#8217;re at it, grab a cup of java and spend some quality time enjoying Darwin&#8217;s art. You&#8217;ll thank me for it!</p>

<p>It’s probably the oldest truism in photography. “If I only had THAT piece of equipment- that newest pro digital camera, that newest $6,000 lens, that newest gizmo- then I could take pictures like that!” Sigh. How many times have you heard that during your lifetime? Oh, what’s that? You haven’t actually said that yourself, have you?</p>

<p>Well, if I had a dollar for every time I’ve heard that said to me, I’d be able to open my own (part-time) bar in Tahiti and not have to work at making photographs. We’ve all heard the other truism, that it is not the equipment but the photographic eye that makes the difference between an award-winning image and a humdrum one. I agree. But, there’s more.</p>

<p>Go ahead and buy that overpriced new lens or camera if you can afford it, I’ll often say. Sure, it might give you better, crisper images. Might, not will. The fact is that these new toys are not only expensive, but they’re bulky and heavy.</p>

<p><a href="http://blog.lesterpickerphoto.com/wp-content/uploads/2011/07/LAP9163.jpg"><img class="size-medium wp-image-1295" title="_LAP9163" src="http://blog.lesterpickerphoto.com/wp-content/uploads/2011/07/LAP9163-300x199.jpg" alt="" width="300" height="199"></a></p>

<p>I was reminded of this on my recent photo excursion to New Mexico, where I lugged a 4x5 film view camera, heavy tripod and my Nikon D700 35mm camera with me, plus four lenses. By now, of course, I’m used to loads like that, weighing in at anywhere from 25 to 40 pounds, depending on my assignment.</p>

<p><a href="http://blog.lesterpickerphoto.com/wp-content/uploads/2011/07/les-on-treadmill_2010-10-01_331%C2%A9LesterPicker.jpg"><img class="size-medium wp-image-1294" title="les on treadmill_2010-10-01_331©LesterPicker" src="http://blog.lesterpickerphoto.com/wp-content/uploads/2011/07/les-on-treadmill_2010-10-01_331%C2%A9LesterPicker-225x300.jpg" alt="" width="225" height="300"></a></p>

<p>And that’s the point of this blog. Watch what you wish for! If you’re generally happy with that point-and-shoot or that small DSLR with a couple of lenses, P-L-E-A-S-E consider yourself very, very fortunate. My wife, with her Canon G12 point-and-shoot, sometimes captures great images before I even set up my damned gear. Do you really want to be lugging your closet around with you, up and down trails, on ledges, near ocean surf? Master the camera you have and nail down the art of composition. Join an online forum and ask for feedback. Ask questions right here. Practice… a lot. When you have reached the limits of your camera, only then consider that latest gizmo.</p>

<p>Happy shooting!</p>

<p>For the final blog in this travel series on Albuquerque, I’ll look at some restaurants that I recently sampled, along with two hotels I experienced. A third motel I stayed in, about 45 minutes outside of ABQ, I will not mention here, even though they left me a wonderful surprise in my bed… a bedbug! Needless to say I darted out of there as quickly as I could. I did post a (negative) review of the hotel on Trip Advisor.</p>

<h2>RESTAURANTS</h2>


<p>ABQ is a great city, blessed with a wide variety of ethnic foods and a nice share of quality restaurants.</p>

<p><strong>El Pinto</strong>. El Pinto is a 1,000 seat restaurant that roasts its own chile peppers and makes its own popular brand of salsa. The menu is quite broad and the food good. El Pinto serves upscale Margaritas using artisanal tequilas. These drinks are outstanding. If you think all magaritas are the same, tell me that after you sample their wares. Try to arrive at a time when you can tour their salsa factory, which is behind the restaurant. <a href="http://www.elpinto.com">www.elpinto.com</a></p>

<p><a href="http://blog.lesterpickerphoto.com/wp-content/uploads/2011/07/LAP9912.jpg"><img class="aligncenter size-medium wp-image-1277" title="El Pinto Restaurant" src="http://blog.lesterpickerphoto.com/wp-content/uploads/2011/07/LAP9912-300x200.jpg" alt="" width="300" height="200"></a></p>

<p><strong>Scalo</strong> Northern Italian Grill. Located in the downtown area in Nob Hill section of the city this comfortable eatery won the coveted Wine Spectator Award of Excellence. Moderately priced, nice ambience and delicious food. <a href="http://www.scalonobhill.com">www.scalonobhill.com</a></p>

<p><strong>Tucanos Brazilian Grill:</strong> Skip this one, unless you like a boisterous, loud and frenetic eat-fest. Their salad bar is excellent, with fresh fruits and veggies. It would be more than enough for an entire meal. Servers circulate with skewers of meats and slice it onto your plate. The shrimp and scallop dishes disappointed, but the meat dishes brought raves from my companions. <a href="http://www.tucanos.com">www.tucanos.com</a></p>

<p><strong>Torinos @ Home</strong>. Wow! is all I can say. This restaurant would be a success in New York City or Florence. The owners are an Italian woman and French chef husband. Daniela, the co-owner, is the most passionate hostess one can imagine. Torinos uses only fresh ingredients, locally grown. <a href="http://torinosfoods.com">http://torinosfoods.com</a></p>

<p><strong>St. Clair Winery &amp; Bistro</strong>: a classy, upscale dining experience that celebrates New Mexico’s emerging and fine wines. The winery runs three bistros in New Mexico. Very nice ambience. <a href="http://www.stclairwinery.com/bistros/albuquerque/">http://www.stclairwinery.com/bistros/albuquerque/</a></p>

<p><strong>St. James Tea Room</strong>: Incredible dining and creative imagination combine in an intimate series of dining spaces, each discreetly separated from its neighbor. You can delight in a 3-course Afternoon Tea experience seated outside in a private garden or inside in Victorian-decorated rooms. Dinners are by reservation only. The desserts are exquisite, but served in small portions so that you may indulge in as many or few as you wish. The selection of tea is not only broad, but deep in quality and individually pot-brewed. <a href="http://www.stjamestearoom.com">www.stjamestearoom.com</a>.</p>

<p><a href="http://blog.lesterpickerphoto.com/wp-content/uploads/2011/07/LAP9972.jpg"><img class="aligncenter size-medium wp-image-1278" title="St. James Tearoom" src="http://blog.lesterpickerphoto.com/wp-content/uploads/2011/07/LAP9972-300x199.jpg" alt="" width="300" height="199"></a></p>

<h2>LODGING</h2>


<p><strong>Hotel Albuquerque at Old Town</strong>: Located just a few blocks from the Old Town Plaza tourist district, this is a comfortable, mainstream hotel with a full complement of amenities. The lobby and rooms are nicely decorated with a Hispanic influence. Breakfasts are excellent. Staff is very helpful. <a href="http://www.hotelabq.com/">http://www.hotelabq.com/</a></p>

<p><strong>Nativo Hotel</strong>: decorated in a Native American theme, the hotel is full service, with a bar, dining area that serves all meals, large lounge, magazine rack. Rooms are tastefully decorated and spacious. I had two stays at the hotel and in each of my rooms dream catchers hung on the wall over my bed, which I’m attributing to my getting a great night’s sleep (okay, maybe my hiking and photographing all day helped a tad). One warning: if you book on a Saturday night you’d better be a stone-dead sleeper or plan to stay awake until 1:30 AM. That’s when the ultra loud, bass-thumping music from their weekly nightclub ends. It’s a great time for the young adult set, but convinces me that every young adult should be socking away money right now into investments in hearing aid companies. <a href="http://www.hhandr.com/nativo.php">http://www.hhandr.com/nativo.php</a></p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>I frequently get questions from readers concerning the safety of their photo equipment when they travel. This is no small concern. As cameras have shrunk and price tags have swollen, so has the tendency of light fingers to pick your pockets, so to speak, increased. Not a pretty picture.</p>

<p>So I was pleased to come across an article written by a photographer colleague, Ned Levi, who is one of the expert commentators and forum supervisors at the Nikonians website (<a href="http://www.nikonians.org">www.nikonians.org</a>). Ned is one of those incredibly knowledgeable resources who tirelessly imparts valuable info to newbies and pros alike.</p>

<p><a href="http://blog.lesterpickerphoto.com/wp-content/uploads/2011/07/packing_2010-07-22_1819%C2%A9LesterPicker.jpg"><img class="aligncenter size-medium wp-image-1272" title="packing_2010-07-22_1819©LesterPicker" src="http://blog.lesterpickerphoto.com/wp-content/uploads/2011/07/packing_2010-07-22_1819%C2%A9LesterPicker-225x300.jpg" alt="" width="225" height="300"></a></p>

<p>A couple of years ago Ned wrote an article for Consumer Traveler about traveling to Europe with photo equipment. When I read it I knew I wanted you all to see it because I have lots of friends who have been robbed while in Europe (and elsewhere). It&#8217;s chock full of great tips, from an experienced pro. Do yourself a favor; whether you&#8217;re traveling to Europe, Asia or the U.S. read this and be prepared.</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><h2>MUSEUMS &amp; CULTURAL ATTRACTIONS</h2>


<p>In Part 1 I discussed events and things to do outdoors while in ABQ. Today it is museums and cultural attractions. In the final installment Ill cover restaurants (God, there are some great ones in ABQ!) and hotels.</p>

<p>One statistic has it that Albuquerque has more museums per capita than any other city its size. You could spend two weeks just touring its wonderful cultural treasures. Here’s a sampling from my recent trip:</p>

<p><strong>Anderson-Abruzzo Albuquerque International Balloon Museum</strong>: What a terrific little museum! Whether or not you’re into ballooning, this quirky museum has it all. From the history of ballooning to flight demonstrations, this is a fun venue for the entire family. It’s located next to the Balloon Fiesta Park, which is the epicenter of the annual Albuquerque balloon festival, held in October. <a href="http://www.balloonmuseum.com">www.balloonmuseum.com</a></p>

<p><a href="http://blog.lesterpickerphoto.com/wp-content/uploads/2011/06/LAP9634.jpg"><img class="size-medium wp-image-1262 " title="_LAP9634" src="http://blog.lesterpickerphoto.com/wp-content/uploads/2011/06/LAP9634-199x300.jpg" alt="" width="199" height="300"></a></p>

<p><strong>Indian Pueblo Cultural Center</strong>: A nicely designed building with lots of information about NM’s 19 pueblos. Every weekend highlights a dance troupe from one of the pueblos. These dances are not performances. They represent the pueblos actually sharing their spiritual dances and blessings with visitors. They are wonderful entertainment, as well as moving testimonies to Native American culture. You might see the Eagle Dance, Buffalo Dance, Butterfly Dance or others, each one explained, with opportunities to interact with the dancers. The Cultural Center includes a complex of buildings and exhibits. <a href="http://www.indianpueblo.org">www.indianpueblo.org</a></p>

<p><a href="http://blog.lesterpickerphoto.com/wp-content/uploads/2011/06/LAP9562.jpg"><img class="size-medium wp-image-1263" title="_LAP9562" src="http://blog.lesterpickerphoto.com/wp-content/uploads/2011/06/LAP9562-200x300.jpg" alt="" width="200" height="300"></a></p>

<p><strong>Explora! Museum</strong>: another must see for the entire family. From the moment you enter the doors, you are thrust into a kaleidoscopic whirlwind of activity. Everything is designed to be touched and manipulated (with frequent disinfecting by staff, btw). No instructions are provided, just exciting opportunities to experiment and be creative. Once a month is adult night. <a href="http://www.explora.us/en/">www.explora.us/en/</a></p>

<p><a href="http://blog.lesterpickerphoto.com/wp-content/uploads/2011/06/LAP0033.jpg"><img class="aligncenter size-medium wp-image-1264" title="Explora Museum" src="http://blog.lesterpickerphoto.com/wp-content/uploads/2011/06/LAP0033-300x199.jpg" alt="" width="300" height="199"></a></p>

<p><strong>National Institute of Flamenco</strong>: Wow, an absolute must see! The professional troupe is totally amazing, captivating, and energetic. You’ll find yourself holding your breath as the dancers go through their routines, adding colorful, extemporaneous flairs. The singing and chanting is very soulful and passionate.  <a href="http://www.nationalinstituteofflamenco.org">www.nationalinstituteofflamenco.org</a></p>

<p><strong>Albuquerque Biological Park</strong>: consists of a small aquarium, botanical garden and zoo, all of which are tailor made for families. Plus, Albuquerque’s nice weather makes this an ideal spot for a picnic. <a href="http://www.cabq.gov/biopark">www.cabq.gov/biopark</a></p>

<p><strong>National Museum of Nuclear Science and History</strong>: Another small museum experience, with invaluable subject matter in today’s atomic age. Lots of reading to do, but well laid out and balanced. From the history of atomic science to the ethics involved, this museum does a fine job of laying out the issues. Not for very young kids.  <a href="http://www.nuclearmuseum.org">www.nuclearmuseum.org</a></p>

<p><strong>New Mexico Museum of Natural History and Science</strong>: This family-friendly museum is a little jewel. One of the things that makes it so understandable is the linear progression of the exhibits, from the origin of the universe, through life on earth, dinosaurs, and present day environments. Lots of hands-on activities for the kids, too. <a href="http://www.nmnaturalhistory.org">www.nmnaturalhistory.org</a></p>

<p><a href="http://blog.lesterpickerphoto.com/wp-content/uploads/2011/06/LAP9984.jpg"><img class="size-medium wp-image-1265" title="New Mexico Museum of Natural History and Science" src="http://blog.lesterpickerphoto.com/wp-content/uploads/2011/06/LAP9984-300x199.jpg" alt="" width="300" height="199"></a></p>

<p><strong>National Hispanic Cultural Center</strong>: Located on a beautiful campus along the banks of the Rio Grande, the Center offers exhibits by nationally and internationally renowned artists and performers. Be sure to take in the Torreon Fresco, painstakingly painted by New Mexico artist Frederico Vigil. The 4,000 square foot work is the largest concave fresco in North America and beautifully depicts more than 3,000 years of Hispanic history.  <a href="http://www.nhccnm.org">www.nhccnm.org</a>/</p>

<p><strong>Acoma Sky City</strong>: Set on a mesa 360 feet above the high desert, Sky City is the oldest continually inhabited community in the United States. Plan for a solid half-day at the modern visitor&#8217;s center, art gallery, gift shop and cafe, before boarding a bus that winds its way up the mesa. The 75-minute tour of Sky City, with its commanding views of the high desert, is exclusively led by Acoma guides. <a href="http://sccc.acomaskycity.org">http://sccc.acomaskycity.org</a>/</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>Mention Albuquerque, New Mexico and what immediately comes to mind is their famous International Balloon Fiesta, held every October. Drawing thousands of balloonists and tens of thousands of tourists from around the world, the festival is a New Mexico icon. It’s a fun, colorful, high-energy, week-long celebration pairing ballooning with myriad venues and activities generated by local entrepreneurs.</p>

<p>But, I’m here to tell you that there is more to Albuquerque than ballooning. Far more. I’ve been to Albuquerque before, but I recently spent 8 days there, intensely exploring its hotels and restaurants, museums and adventure opportunities for a travel article. I came away impressed. So impressed, in fact, I am going to split my review into three parts, simply because there was so much to do and such terrific eats. Here I’ll discuss Things to See and Do; in Part 2 I’ll discuss Museums and other Cultural Attractions; in Part 3 I’ll discuss my choices for Eats and Retreats. Throughout, I’ll be using the airport abbreviation for Albuquerque (ABQ).</p>

<h3><strong>Weather</strong></h3>


<p>The weather in ABQ is relatively mild. I say relatively, because winter can be cold, with temps dipping into the twenties. On the other end of the thermometer, temps can top out at 100F.  But temperatures usually fluctuate between the upper forties and lower nineties. That’s pretty mild in my book. However, please keep in mind that when I visited in May for this series of blogs and magazine articles, the temperatures were an ideal 55-80, with bright, sunny skies and little humidity… except when it rained. Mind you, I’m talking in and around the city proper. Once you get into the high desert environment, temps can be brutal in summer.</p>

<h3>Camera</h3>


<p>I find that a point-and-shoot or a DSLR with a general purpose lens works best for touring around. In the case of these images, for example, I took most with my Nikon D700 and 24-70mm lens.</p>

<h2>HIGH ADVENTURE</h2>


<p><strong>The ABQ Trolley</strong>: This is one delightful, sit-back-and-enjoy experience as the two friends (and former tourism officials) who started it continue to run it. The running narration is very funny, as well as informative. By time you disembark, you’ll have a real sense of the city. The tour includes travel along historic Route 66, Old Town, Nob Hill and Downtown. <a href="http://www.abqtrolley.com">http://www.abqtrolley.com</a></p>

<p><a href="http://blog.lesterpickerphoto.com/wp-content/uploads/2011/06/LAP9810.jpg"><img class="aligncenter size-medium wp-image-1252" title="_LAP9810" src="http://blog.lesterpickerphoto.com/wp-content/uploads/2011/06/LAP9810-300x199.jpg" alt="" width="300" height="199"></a>
<a href="http://www.abqtrolley.com"></a></p>

<p><strong>Sandia Peak Tramway</strong>: this is the world’s longest tramway and is a must-experience venue that soars over the Cibola National Forest. Terminating at 10,378 feet, the peak boasts a restaurant and commanding views. It also brings riders to the ski lodge during the winter season. The ride to the top is enjoyable, with expansive views of the landscape. At twilight, if the sun is right, the Sandia mountains blaze with their namesake watermelon color. <a href="http://www.sandiapeak.com">www.sandiapeak.com </a></p>

<p><a href="http://www.sandiapeak.com"></a></p>

<p><strong>Hot Air Ballooning</strong>: Is there any sport in Albuquerque more iconic than hot air ballooning? Balloon rides are an inexpensive (relatively) and unique way to view Albuquerque and its environs. <em>Rainbow Ryders</em> is the largest balloon company in ABQ, attesting to the skill and business acumen of Scott Apelman, its founder. With more than 4500 balloon flights, Apelman is considered the dean of ballooning in Duke City (another name for ABQ, having nothing to do with John Wayne… stay tuned). <a href="http://www.rainbowryders.com">www.rainbowryders.com </a></p>

<p><strong>Jeep Tours</strong>: Try <em>New Mexico Jeep Tours</em>. Run by former Albuquerque police detective Roch Hart, be prepared for a jeep tour like no other. This is not about high-speed buggy rides. This is a thoughtful exploration of the high desert environment, including its wildlife, geology and native culture, run by a passionate professional. <a href="http://www.nmjeeptours.com">www.nmjeeptours.com </a></p>

<p><strong> </strong></p>

<p><strong>Old Town Walking Tour</strong>: sign up for an informative tour of Old Town and learn about its history from 1706 to the present. Enjoy stops at San Felipe de Neri church (the oldest building in the city) and the more than 100 shops, art galleries and restaurants. Consult the website for days and times. <a href="http://www.cabq.gov/museum/oldtowntour.html">http://www.cabq.gov/museum/oldtowntour.html</a> or <a href="http://www.albuquerqueoldtown.com">www.albuquerqueoldtown.com</a></p>

<p><strong>Canoeing/Kayaking</strong>: Although I didn’t personally kayak or canoe on my recent visit, I do know that several tour operators run guided tours in and around Albuquerque. The Albuquerque Convention and Visitors Bureau is a great resource: <a href="http://www.itsatrip.org">www.itsatrip.org</a></p>

<p><a href="http://www.itsatrip.org"></a></p>

<p><strong>Golf</strong>: Even though I’m a duffer, I’d hardly call golf an adventure, but in and around Albuquerque you’ll find dozens of courses for every handicap and budget. <a href="http://www.itsatrip.org">www.itsatrip.org </a></p>

<h2>PARKS , HIKES &amp; TRAILS</h2>


<p><strong>Petroglyph National Monument</strong>: right in Albuquerque and easy to get to, the monument allows one to amble through paths that showcase prehistoric Native American art carved into rock. There are more than 20,000 carvings of people, insects, birds, mammals, and even symbols and geometric designs that we still do not understand (Area 51, anyone?).

<p><strong>Sandia Mountain Trails</strong>: Albuquerque is an outdoor town, with mild year-round temperatures that encourage its residents to stay active. The trail system through and surrounding ABQ is second to none and offers easy to difficult trekking levels. Hike, bike, horseback ride, run, photograph. <a href="http://www.sandiahiking.com">www.sandiahiking.com</a></p>

<p><strong>Some Outdoor Precautions</strong></p>

<p>Here are a few things to keep in mind when visiting New Mexico in general. ABQ, in particular, is at 5,000+ feet, so sunlight issues are magnified.</p>

<p>1.  Slather on sunscreen whenever you go outside, especially in summer. The sun and altitude are unforgiving. Bring it with you on hikes and reapply as needed.</p>

<p>2.  Bring twice as much water as you think you’ll need.</p>

<p>3.  If you are hiking, know the terrain. Better yet, hire a guide.</p>

<p>4.  Know your physical limitations and respect them.</p>

<p>5.  Let people know where you’ll be hiking and when you expect to return.</p>

<p>6.  Be snake aware. Wearing snake gaitors may look dorky, but they work, since most snake strikes are below the knee. However, it would be unusual to find snakes on established paths. Still, watch your step.</p>

<p>7.  Carry snack food with you.</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>As photographers we hear about and discuss ‘noise’ quite a bit. For you photography newbies, digital noise is equivalent to what we used to call ‘grain’ in film days.</p>

<p>By now my readers know that I’m not one to waste a lot of space on highly technical explanations. If you want to understand noise or grain at a technical level, there are some fine resources out there. Just start by Googling the terms “film grain” and “digital camera noise” or “digital sensor noise” and you’ll soon be an expert (or intolerably bored). You might also try my associate, Bob Boyer’s, blog where he regularly waxes highly technical on weighty issues like digital noise, color balance and other issues (<a href="http://photo.rwboyer.com">http://photo.rwboyer.com/</a>). Suffice it to say that digital noise gives an image a grainy look and shows up most noticeably in the shadow areas of an image. Most people would consider the look distracting at best.</p>

<p>Noise will begin to appear in an image when you raise the ISO, usually above 400 or 800, depending on the quality of the camera sensor and whether or not the image contains lots of shadow areas. I, myself, rarely shoot at 800, since I most often shoot landscapes and try to shoot at ISO 200 or below to minimize noise. The “native” ISO of most modern DSLR cameras is around 200, meaning that their sensors are optimized for that ISO, so it’s usually a good bet to stick with that ISO number for images where fine detail is paramount.</p>

<p>Here’s the problem; if the light is poor, to stay at ISO 200 you would need to hand-hold the camera at a shutter speed that might cause blurring due to hand shake. As I’ve gotten older, I can no longer hand-hold any slower than 1/30 of a second depending, of course, on the weight of the lens I’m using. So, what many photographers do is simply increase the ISO to compensate. For example, let’s say I’m shooting an old factory building in Baltimore, the nearest city to where I live, on an overcast day. I want good depth of field, so I’m going to shoot at f16 and I’m on ISO 200. My camera tells me that with the lens I’m using, I need to shoot at 1/15 of a second. Not good for me. So I up my ISO to 400. Now I can shoot at 1/30. If I up it to ISO 800, I can shoot at 1/60. Great.</p>

<p>But wait. At ISO 800, the shadow areas of the building are showing up on my LCD screen a bit grainy. What I usually choose to do is use a tripod, eliminating hand shake and allowing me to shoot at 1/15. But, I don’t have a tripod with me. What do I do?</p>

<p>The answer may very well be: do nothing. Go ahead and shoot at ISO 800. Shoot at 1600. Shoot at 3200. The point here is that digital noise, by itself, is not good or bad. It is a tool in your photographic toolbox. In this case you may very well want to emphasize noise, creating a dark, moody, gritty interpretation of the scene.</p>

<p><a href="http://blog.lesterpickerphoto.com/wp-content/uploads/2011/06/untitled-154-of-170.jpg"><img class="size-medium wp-image-1244" title="Capetown, South Africa" src="http://blog.lesterpickerphoto.com/wp-content/uploads/2011/06/untitled-154-of-170-200x300.jpg" alt="" width="200" height="300"></a></p>

<p>I remember when I was training as a cub reporter and purchased my very first Nikon camera. I practiced all the time, since I could use the paper’s darkroom for free on my own time. I would watch some of the veteran photojournalists pull a photo from the soup, almost always a crisp, clean shot. But then one of the men (they were almost all men in those days) was on assignment for a story on inner city crime. He pulled out a photo that had me spellbound. The image of the darkened street was underexposed. The drug dealer leaning against the corner lamppost was in shadow. The scene was full of grain. Its grittiness perfectly captured the feel of the dangerous street underworld.</p>

<p><a href="http://blog.lesterpickerphoto.com/wp-content/uploads/2011/06/1981-11-Egypt-Luxor-boatbuilder_edited-1.jpg"><img class="size-medium wp-image-1245" title="Boat rebuilder, Aswan, Egypt" src="http://blog.lesterpickerphoto.com/wp-content/uploads/2011/06/1981-11-Egypt-Luxor-boatbuilder_edited-1-236x300.jpg" alt="" width="236" height="300"></a></p>

<p>Give yourself permission to experiment with noise, even if you are a landscape photographer. Up the ISO, especially on dark, brooding days when you might be prone to pack up and wait for sunnier conditions. You just might like what you see!</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>Just got back from a wonderful fiction writer&#8217;s conference in San Diego (more on that in a later blog). Getting there and back necessitated 4 flights segments, so I had to listen to the &#8220;fasten your seatbelt&#8221; instruction 4 times.</p>

<p><a href="http://blog.lesterpickerphoto.com/wp-content/uploads/2011/06/fasten-seat-belt-fa.jpg"><img class="size-medium wp-image-1239" title="Stock Photo" src="http://blog.lesterpickerphoto.com/wp-content/uploads/2011/06/fasten-seat-belt-fa-200x300.jpg" alt="" width="200" height="300"></a></p>

<p style="text-align: center;"></p>


<p>The thought occurs to me: Is there a moron anywhere in the world who doesn&#8217;t know how to buckle a seatbelt?? Do we really still need flight attendants worldwide instructing us on how to fasten a seat belt? Does anyone have any idea of how much time is wasted every day on this inane instruction?</p>

<p>The way I figure it, anyone who doesn&#8217;t know how to buckle a seatbelt should be removed from the gene pool anyway! Then again, seatbelt or not, what are your chances of making it out alive from a plane crash?</p>

<p>I think that anyone over age 5 should have to pass a seat belt buckling proficiency test before boarding. If you flunk, you are sent down to the rental car counter where- does this makes any sense?- you can rent a car without any seatbelt instruction whatsoever, even though seat belts are well proven to save lives in the event of a car crash. Go figure!</p>
