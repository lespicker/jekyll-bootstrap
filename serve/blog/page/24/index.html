  <div class="entry-content"><p>I was shooting my most recent photo installation with my associate, Bob Boyer, when he suggested I write a blog on a common and frustrating issue for photographers. We had just viewed some outtakes of the photo session and noticed that many of the images included materials along the edges that we had not wanted to be in the frame.</p>

<p>The issue here is that many viewfinders, that is the scene you see when you look through the eyepiece or the back of your digital screen, does not actually represent what the camera will record on the sensor. In my case, my Nikon D700 that we were using for this shoot has 95% coverage. That means that the actual image the camera produces will include 5% more coverage around the edges than what I saw with my own eyes as I squinted through the eyepiece. Fortunately we noticed this as we shot, since we were tethered to my trusty Apple MacBook Air and could see the images immediately on its crisp 13” screen.</p>

<p>In this first image, we noticed the white photo ID placard to the left of my wall-mounted images, good for marketing my work to patrons, but bad for a PR brochure shot.</p>

<p><a href="http://blog.lesterpickerphoto.com/wp-content/uploads/2011/05/LAP8976.jpg"><img class="aligncenter size-medium wp-image-1079" title="_LAP8976" src="http://blog.lesterpickerphoto.com/wp-content/uploads/2011/05/LAP8976-300x199.jpg" alt="" width="300" height="199"></a></p>

<p>In this next shot I cropped in-camera to remove that distraction.</p>

<p><a href="http://blog.lesterpickerphoto.com/wp-content/uploads/2011/05/LAP8982.jpg"><img class="aligncenter size-medium wp-image-1080" title="_LAP8982" src="http://blog.lesterpickerphoto.com/wp-content/uploads/2011/05/LAP8982-300x199.jpg" alt="" width="300" height="199"></a></p>

<p>However, this viewfinder issue can be a real problem in some situations, as unwanted distractions pop up in the final image. Okay, you may say, that’s no big deal, I can just crop the image and remove the distractions if you do your own post-processing. That’s often true. But don’t forget that most digital SLRs have a 2:3 format or perhaps a 4:3 format, known as the aspect ratio, meaning that the image size is longer than wide. That means that you can’t crop equally on all sides, which may affect your composition.</p>

<p>With some digital point-and-shoot cameras you can change the aspect ratio. The Canon G12, for example, can be changed from its native 4:3 ratio to 3:2 or others. But it famously has 100% viewfinder coverage, so what you see is what you get.</p>

<p>My point here is that you should always check out your owner’s manual to see what your viewfinder coverage is. Take some test shots, too. At very close range 5% missing coverage may not mean a lot, but in a landscape scene it might include a good deal of unplanned detail that can ruin a shot.</p>

<p>Happy shooting!</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>Life is a rich stew of pain, pleasures, new discoveries and chance meetings. I’m waxing philosophical here because of my Internet friendship with James Winters, a professional musician and amateur photographer, who comments frequently here on my blog site. I’ve written about James’ heart-felt photography before (<a href="http://blog.lesterpickerphoto.com/2011/03/31/an-eye-for-photography/">http://blog.lesterpickerphoto.com/2011/03/31/an-eye-for-photography/</a>).</p>

<p>In a recent post on the Nikonians website, Jim credited me and another photographer with inspiring him to think more seriously about his gift. Sure enough, a day later this other photographer sent me a blog comment and so, curiously, I visited his website to check him out.</p>

<p>Wow! Was all I could say for the first ten minutes or so, as my eyes and brain were treated to some of the most evocative images I have ever seen. This young man (well, young to me, anyway) has that rare combination of a good eye… no, a great eye and the technical skills to match.</p>

<p>His name is Daniel Stainer and he lives in western Pennsylvania near some outstanding natural areas that he brings to life in his images. I’m not sure which of his images I like more, his black and whites or color, nature or people, because all are spectacular. He is a semi-pro shooter who is, quite frankly, in my opinion, wasting his time doing anything else but devoting himself full-time to helping the rest of us see the world through his acute and sensitive eyes. Then again, I know full well the need to provide for a family (he is married and co-raising 3 children). But I also know the pain of not being able to do what you love when the muse visits. So, I want to also acknowledge Daniel’s sacrifice for those he loves.</p>

<p><a href="http://blog.lesterpickerphoto.com/wp-content/uploads/2011/04/5280375315_6c18a6fa6a.jpg"><img class="aligncenter size-medium wp-image-1076" title="5280375315_6c18a6fa6a" src="http://blog.lesterpickerphoto.com/wp-content/uploads/2011/04/5280375315_6c18a6fa6a-300x300.jpg" alt="" width="300" height="300"></a></p>

<p>Please treat yourself to a visit to Daniel’s site (<a href="http://www.danielstainer.com/">http://www.danielstainer.com/</a>) and see if you agree with me. As always, I welcome your comments here.</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>I am incredibly honored to have been named to the faculty of the prestigious Nikonians Academy (<a href="http://www.nikoniansacademy.com/viewFacultyPage.html?page_id=7">http://www.nikoniansacademy.com/viewFacultyPage.html?page_id=7</a>). Nikonians is the world&#8217;s largest organization of Nikon devotees. It is a wealth of information on anything Nikon&#8230; and more. Their forums are chock full of useful information about photography in general and I often contribute to them as my schedule permits. It&#8217;s also my go-to resource when I have a technical question.</p>

<p><a href="http://blog.lesterpickerphoto.com/wp-content/uploads/2011/04/LesPicker_284px.jpg"><img class="aligncenter size-medium wp-image-1065" title="LesPicker_284px" src="http://blog.lesterpickerphoto.com/wp-content/uploads/2011/04/LesPicker_284px-217x300.jpg" alt="" width="217" height="300"></a></p>

<p>As a faculty-member, I will be offering workshops in the field for accomplished and aspiring photographers. The wonderful thing about Nikonians workshops is that we accommodate all skill levels and all cameras. You do not have to own a Nikon to come along. Each workshop is designed with the photographer in mind. We do all the planning and preliminary work; you show up and enjoy the best photo locations, good food, and excellent instruction. There&#8217;s simply no better way to learn new skills and improve existing ones than with the one-on-one a small group workshop provides.</p>

<p>Check out Nikonians (<a href="www.nikonians.org">www.nikonians.org</a>) and after you are wowed by all it offers, check out my first workshop, which will be held this summer in the pristine Yukon wilderness of Canada. Want to photograph bears? We got &#8216;em! Caribou, elk, fox, wolves, beaver? Done! Spectacular landscapes? Join me this summer from August 27 to September 3. Here is the workshop description: <a href="http://www.nikoniansacademy.com/nikon-Yukon%2B-%2BCanada%27s%2BUntamed%2BWilderness-workshop/96">http://www.nikoniansacademy.com/nikon-Yukon%2B-%2BCanada%27s%2BUntamed%2BWilderness-workshop/96</a>. I&#8217;d love to see you there!</p>

<p>If you&#8217;d like to see examples of Yukon landscapes and wildlife, check out my Yukon gallery: <a href="http://www.lesterpickerphoto.com/gallery.php?gallery=yukon">http://www.lesterpickerphoto.com/gallery.php?gallery=yukon</a>.</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>It’s now official. After months of planning, I will be offering a photography workshop for the Nikonians Academy in the Yukon, a place I love dearly. The course will run from August 27<sup>th</sup> to September 4<sup>th</sup>, the absolutely most spectacular time of the year to be in Canada’s famed Yukon Territory.</p>

<p><a href="http://www.nikoniansacademy.com/all/viewWorkshop.html?course_id=838">http://www.nikoniansacademy.com/all/viewWorkshop.html?course_id=838</a></p>

<p><a href="http://blog.lesterpickerphoto.com/wp-content/uploads/2011/04/Terry-photo-installation.jpg"><img class="size-medium wp-image-1056" title="Terry photo installation" src="http://blog.lesterpickerphoto.com/wp-content/uploads/2011/04/Terry-photo-installation-300x199.jpg" alt="" width="300" height="199"></a></p>

<p>Late August is the drop-dead gorgeous Fall season in Yukon. We will begin our journey in Whitehorse, where the Yukon’s only international airport is located. After an orientation session we drive by commercial vans to Dawson City, site of the famous Klondike Gold Rush. This historic town is a photographer’s dream, with gravel streets, wood sidewalks and historical structures in various states of repair. The indigenous First Nations culture is alive and well here, too.</p>

<p>While in the Dawson region, we will have numerous opportunities to photograph the Northern Lights, an amazing spectacle that everyone must see sometime in their life. While in Dawson we will travel the scenic Top of the World Highway to Alaska, photographing the landscape and an abandoned gold mine town.</p>

<p><a href="http://blog.lesterpickerphoto.com/wp-content/uploads/2011/04/northernlights1.jpg"><img class="size-medium wp-image-1057" title="northernlights1" src="http://blog.lesterpickerphoto.com/wp-content/uploads/2011/04/northernlights1-199x300.jpg" alt="" width="199" height="300"></a></p>

<p>Next we travel up the storied Dempster Highway to the Arctic Circle, where we should have many opportunities to photograph grizzly bears, moose, foxes, beavers, caribou, eagles and other wildlife. The scenery changes markedly from forest to tundra as we head north to the Arctic Circle. Most incredible is the change of color as Fall transforms the tundra into flaming reds, oranges and earth-tones. There is nothing else like it, a place few people get to visit, let alone photograph with two professional guides. Since we are so far north, daylight lasts until 11 PM. What more can a photographer ask for?</p>

<p><a href="http://blog.lesterpickerphoto.com/wp-content/uploads/2011/04/DEmpster.jpeg"><img class="size-medium wp-image-1058" title="Dempster Hwy view from YT/NWT border," src="http://blog.lesterpickerphoto.com/wp-content/uploads/2011/04/DEmpster-224x300.jpg" alt="" width="224" height="300"></a></p>

<p>I say two guides because I will be accompanied by my co-instructor Richard Hartmier (<a href="http://www.hartmier.com">www.hartmier.com</a>) a Yukon resident and photographer par excellence. Richard is a storehouse of knowledge about the Yukon environment, knows hidden photography spots that a casual visitor would never discover, and is an excellent instructor.</p>

<p><a href="http://blog.lesterpickerphoto.com/wp-content/uploads/2011/04/Maine-2009-Longpond-hdr-2.jpg"><img class="size-medium wp-image-1059" title="Maine 2009-Longpond-hdr (2)" src="http://blog.lesterpickerphoto.com/wp-content/uploads/2011/04/Maine-2009-Longpond-hdr-2-300x200.jpg" alt="" width="300" height="200"></a></p>

<p>As we retrace our steps to get back to Whitehorse, the Fall landscapes will have changed dramatically and we’ll stop and shoot our way back during sunrises, sunsets and nighttime Aurora excursions.</p>

<p>When you first arrive in Whitehorse, you will not have ot take out your wallet again (except for alcoholic beverages). All food, transportation, even sunscreen and insect repellant, are included. We want you to focus exclusively on photography.</p>

<p>Nikonians workshops are for all levels of photographic skills. Here you’ll have a chance to learn new techniques, refine existing techniques, or just plain snap some images on your point-and-shoot. The workshop is limited to 14 people, so everyone has plenty of instructional time, as needed. Nikonians workshops are fun, with lots of information sharing throughout.</p>

<p>For the full itinerary, fees, and other travel information, please go to:</p>

<p><a href="http://www.nikoniansacademy.com/all/viewWorkshop.html?course_id=838">http://www.nikoniansacademy.com/all/viewWorkshop.html?course_id=838</a></p>

<p>Oh, did I mention grizzlies?</p>

<p><a href="http://blog.lesterpickerphoto.com/wp-content/uploads/2011/04/Maine-2009-Longpond-hdr.jpg"><img class="size-medium wp-image-1060" title="Maine 2009-Longpond-hdr" src="http://blog.lesterpickerphoto.com/wp-content/uploads/2011/04/Maine-2009-Longpond-hdr-300x198.jpg" alt="" width="300" height="198"></a></p>

<p>I hope to see some of you there!</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>Every so often an amateur photographer will write to me with comments on my images or to ask for advice. I enjoy both, even if the comments are negative, because I like to understand what about my images turn people on or off.</p>

<p>In most cases, if my reader includes a website or Flickr account, I check it out. I invariably enjoy the images, which give me insights into the person, his or her likes and dislikes, and their eye for photography. It’s one of the more enjoyable aspects of what I do.</p>

<p>Once in a while I am impressed by a reader’s images and have blogged about that individual’s work. But once in a very, very great while a reader’s images will, quite simply, blow me away.</p>

<p>That was the case a few months back when James Winters commented on my work. We corresponded back and forth for a while and I came to find out that James lives in a geodesic dome in Maine that I actually visited a few times as a starving doctoral student when it was being built by one of my friends back in 1976! How’s that for synchronicity, or whatever you’d call it?</p>

<p>In any event, Jim is fairly new to DSLR photography, but he managed to pick up a Nikon with a couple of lenses. Many of Jim’s images are solidly good, but fairly ordinary, as he is learning to master his hobby. Frankly, a small percentage of his images I would have culled if they were my albums. But then there are images on his site— lots of them— that are so wonderful they grab at your heart. I’ve asked Jim for permission to write about him and to highlight a sampling of his images to show you how they affect me.</p>

<p>First, the gestalt; the cumulative effect of Jim’s work is to show how much family means to him. His shots of people, kids in particular, are fresh, candid and full of life’s magic moments. With eleven (!) children, a wife and tons of friends, Jim has ample subject matter, to be sure. But it’s the joys and disappointments that he captures in everyday moments that makes his work stand apart. If you spend time in his world, and there is abundant opportunity with thousands of images, you gain a sense of his children’s personalities, some impish, some quiet and restrained. You also get a glimpse into the frenetic, loving and creative home that Jim and his wife, Laura, have crafted.</p>

<p><a href="http://blog.lesterpickerphoto.com/wp-content/uploads/2011/03/393073290_z8FX2-L.jpg"><img class="aligncenter size-medium wp-image-1041" title="393073290_z8FX2-L" src="http://blog.lesterpickerphoto.com/wp-content/uploads/2011/03/393073290_z8FX2-L-300x225.jpg" alt="" width="300" height="225"></a></p>

<p>I thought I would comment on each image, relating what I like about each. But as I thought on it, I believe the  best way to go is to just post a bunch of Jim&#8217;s images and let YOU, my readers, comment first. Then I&#8217;ll chime in with my responses. As always, click on an image to enlarge it.</p>

<p><a href="http://blog.lesterpickerphoto.com/wp-content/uploads/2011/03/364448900_Hvvbe-L.jpg"><img class="aligncenter size-medium wp-image-1042" title="364448900_Hvvbe-L" src="http://blog.lesterpickerphoto.com/wp-content/uploads/2011/03/364448900_Hvvbe-L-300x225.jpg" alt="" width="300" height="225"></a></p>

<p><a href="http://blog.lesterpickerphoto.com/wp-content/uploads/2011/03/352659260_JAiic-Ti.jpg"><img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-1043" title="352659260_JAiic-Ti" src="http://blog.lesterpickerphoto.com/wp-content/uploads/2011/03/352659260_JAiic-Ti.jpg" alt="" width="100" height="100"></a></p>

<p><a href="http://blog.lesterpickerphoto.com/wp-content/uploads/2011/03/392146858_FnzYQ-L.jpg"><img class="aligncenter size-medium wp-image-1044" title="392146858_FnzYQ-L" src="http://blog.lesterpickerphoto.com/wp-content/uploads/2011/03/392146858_FnzYQ-L-300x225.jpg" alt="" width="300" height="225"></a></p>

<p>This next one, though, I can&#8217;t refrain from commenting on. To me, this is simply an amazing image. Is it the blur of the boy active on the swing? The girl standing and watching, wearing a &#8220;traditional&#8221; dress. The expression on the face of the girl? But above all, I see a story here, a yearning on my part to know what is going on. Who are they? What is the girl thinking? What is the setting? And that&#8217;s the beauty of photography; it is at its best when it tells a story.</p>

<p><a href="http://blog.lesterpickerphoto.com/wp-content/uploads/2011/03/390717702_z6PFV-L.jpg"><img class="aligncenter size-medium wp-image-1045" title="390717702_z6PFV-L" src="http://blog.lesterpickerphoto.com/wp-content/uploads/2011/03/390717702_z6PFV-L-300x225.jpg" alt="" width="300" height="225"></a></p>

<p>When you have the chance, go to: <a href="http://vielle.smugmug.com/Family/the-main-folder/5475774_MtSEg#1205479117_Nyg5L">http://vielle.smugmug.com/Family/the-main-folder/5475774_MtSEg#1205479117_Nyg5L</a> and randomly go through his work. If nothing else, Jim’s body of work shows me that one doesn’t have to be a pro to get meaningful, dramatic results, even from life&#8217;s everyday moments. Jim does what he does in photography simply for the joy of capturing those special family moments and sharing them with his extended network of friends and family. For that, we are all grateful.</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>A few months ago, I was asked to be the exclusive artist for a wonderful new upscale restaurant opening in the county in which I live. I was honored to have been asked and after I agreed to do it the reality of the situation hit me. Here it was, literally weeks from opening, and I had to design the installation, choose the images, get them printed and install them before the grand opening, and that was on top of my other assignments. Stress city, here I come!</p>

<p>Now we’re just a week away from the Grand Opening and I thought you might want to see what has gone into the production from the photographer’s viewpoint.</p>

<h3>Hats off to Bob</h3>


<p>First, I’ve got to say that none of this would have been possible— well possible, but not as expertly done— without the able assistance of Bob Boyer. Bob and I have been working together for a couple of years now and we have entire sets of non-overlapping skills. Bob is a computer expert (<a href="http://photo.rwboyer.com">http://photo.rwboyer.com</a>), while I know nothing about what goes on inside the black box. Bob is a studio photographer and indoor lighting expert, while I would much rather be outdoors, shooting landscapes in minus-30F or plus-110F. Thankfully, Bob is also a printing maven, a true master of the craft, a digital Ansel Adams, if you will (or Edward Westin, who he prefers).</p>

<h3>Carsins&#8217;: The Restaurant</h3>


<p>Carsins’—that’s the name of the restaurant… and yes, the apostrophe is in the right place— is the brainchild of Terry Cheung, an experienced and successful restaurateur. It will open as a steak and seafood establishment, although Terry plans to add sushi to the fare a few months after opening. It occupies a large footprint and so our selection of images was governed both by size and the unique wall surfaces throughout. In the end we settled on 22 images, some individual and others in geographic or thematic groupings, such as Canadian scenics or wildlife images.</p>

<p>We also wanted to highlight for customers, many of whom will be corporate executives, what our capabilities are for potential displays in their offices or building lobbies. So, we chose several display media, most notably ColorPlak, aluminum, face-mounted plexiglass (FMP) and traditional matted and framed prints.</p>

<p>Once the images were selected from my Aperture files, we assembled them using the lightbox feature within Aperture and began to arrange them in individual spaces or in pleasing wall groupings. Once I was done with that I handed the images over to Bob to work his magic.</p>

<h3>Printing Challenges</h3>


<p>Anyone who knows anything about printing images knows that every paper type prints slightly differently. To get the best print possible, you’d better know how each paper handles contrast and tonality, for example. Now, multiply that knowledge several times to understand how different <strong><em>media</em></strong> affect print quality. ColorPlak, for example, handles contrast wholly differently than FMP, so Bob had to incorporate those differences for every image, paper and medium.</p>

<p>Finally, the images began to be delivered to us, in the case of ColorPlak, freighted across the country to us from California. For the black and white images, we did our own printing and only had to pick them up from the framing shop.</p>

<h3>The Installation Starts</h3>


<p>Here I am installing one array of images on a dining room wall (just click on each image to enlarge). We do all the installations ourselves so as to get the exact look we want. Sure it takes me away from photographing, but it’s all part of artistic expression, so I enjoy that hands-on part of my artwork.</p>

<p><a href="http://blog.lesterpickerphoto.com/wp-content/uploads/2011/03/P1010178.jpg"><img class="size-medium wp-image-1031" title="P1010178" src="http://blog.lesterpickerphoto.com/wp-content/uploads/2011/03/P1010178-300x168.jpg" alt="" width="300" height="168"></a></p>

<p>The biggest challenge we faced was choosing and mounting one iconic image that would serve as the visual focal point for those entering the main dining room. After many visits to the unfinished space and some rousing debates, we finally took a big gamble and settled on an image I took while in the Yukon Territory and Northwest Territory of Canada two years ago. One day a storm approached us as I was photographing. My wife wanted to leave as the wind began to blow fiercely and the temperatures dropped precipitously. I persuaded her to stay for a few minutes more. I weighted down my tripod and took this image, one of my favorites.</p>

<p><a href="http://blog.lesterpickerphoto.com/wp-content/uploads/2011/03/Yukon2009-Dempster-Highway-1782009-09-05.jpg"><img class="size-medium wp-image-1034" title="Yukon2009-Dempster Highway 1782009-09-05" src="http://blog.lesterpickerphoto.com/wp-content/uploads/2011/03/Yukon2009-Dempster-Highway-1782009-09-05-300x199.jpg" alt="" width="300" height="199"></a></p>

<p>The challenge for Bob was to blow that 12-megapixel image up to 5 feet by 9 feet!!! That he was able to do so is a testament to his expertise. We decided to do it as a triptych, which we felt would add some dynamism to the look. We sent the file to ColorPlak (<a href="http://www.colorplak.com">www.colorplak.com</a>) and, as usual, they did a phenomenal job on it.</p>

<p>Here is the image as it appears on the dining room wall.</p>

<p><a href="http://blog.lesterpickerphoto.com/wp-content/uploads/2011/03/P1010185.jpg"><img class="size-medium wp-image-1032" title="P1010185" src="http://blog.lesterpickerphoto.com/wp-content/uploads/2011/03/P1010185-300x168.jpg" alt="" width="300" height="168"></a></p>

<p>Stay tuned as we complete the installation. At that point I’ll photograph the installation and post a tour of the restaurant decorated with my images and Bob’s painstaking print work. As always, please give us your opinions and suggestions for improvements.</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>It’s the age-old debate among photographers: gloves vs. mittens. Which are best for the serious photographer, amateur or pro?</p>

<p>For most photographers, the choice is a matter of preference, since the overwhelming majority of enthusiasts shoot in warm or mildly cold temperatures. In those cases you can get away with a light glove, like the excellent wool gloves made by Lowepro that sport rubberized palms and fingers that give the photographer a good grip. I own a pair that I use through the Fall shooting season.</p>

<p><a href="http://blog.lesterpickerphoto.com/wp-content/uploads/2011/03/31948.jpg"><img class="aligncenter size-medium wp-image-1023" title="31948" src="http://blog.lesterpickerphoto.com/wp-content/uploads/2011/03/31948-300x300.jpg" alt="" width="300" height="300"></a></p>

<p>Many photographers I know prefer mittens, simply slipping them off when it comes time to shoot. But, what about seriously cold weather? What does a photographer do in sustained conditions of -25F? I had an opportunity to test this out on my recent photo expedition to Canada’s striking Yukon Territory, where cold is… well, very, very cold.</p>

<p>Having had frostbitten fingers on more than one occasion in my youth living in Maine, I’m susceptible to repeat experiences, so I’m unusually careful with my hand wear in winter. I also have a doctorate in winter ecology, meaning that I love being outdoors when the temps drop, so go figure. I have tried every conceivable glove on the market; Gore-tex, insulated, down-filled, fat, skinny, natural, synthetic, 5-finger and 3-finger hybrids. I’ve also tried every mitten imaginable.</p>

<p>What works for me when I’m photographing in severe cold is this: a thin glove under an insulated mitten. That way I can slip off the mitten once I’m ready to shoot and replace it once the deed is done. The problem has always been what to do with the mitten. I’ve tried clipping it to my sleeve (cumbersome), tying it to the other mitten under my jacket (okay, but not great in Arctic conditions) or just taking 4 pairs with me so that as I lose them I just replace them (very costly and definitely not recommended). Finally, I think I have the perfect solution for my needs.</p>

<p>This was my setup on my latest trip: a layer of very thin Seirus Hyperlite All-Weather gloves- purchased from REI- underneath a pair of mittens made by Swany America (<a href="http://www.swamyamerica.com">www.swanyamerica.com</a>). Be forewarned that the Seirus Hyperlites will not last more than a season under regular photographic use. All the wheels and buttons we use tend to eventually shred the forefinger material.</p>

<p>The Swany mittens are another matter entirely in terms of durability. They offer a line of mittens known as the Toaster collection, available in both men and women models. What makes the Toaster mittens unique is they have a water-sealed zipper along the side of the mitten, allowing you to unzip, poke your hand through, take care of your camera controls and make the shot, then withdraw into the comfort and warmth of the mitten.</p>

<p><a href="http://blog.lesterpickerphoto.com/wp-content/uploads/2011/03/9b2cf93bfff2569b7ac52c48448a73611.jpg"><img class="size-full wp-image-1025" title="9b2cf93bfff2569b7ac52c48448a7361" src="http://blog.lesterpickerphoto.com/wp-content/uploads/2011/03/9b2cf93bfff2569b7ac52c48448a73611.jpg" alt="" width="136" height="250"></a></p>

<p>The Swany mittens are ruggedly constructed, with attention to detail that reflects the ethic of this upstate New York company (the gloves are manufactured in China).</p>

<p>I used the Seirus-Swany pairing throughout my Yukon assignment, including dog mushing. On two nights I was out for up to five hours at a time photographing the Northern Lights (<a href="http://blog.lesterpickerphoto.com/2011/02/15/how-to-photograph-the-northern-lights/">http://blog.lesterpickerphoto.com/2011/02/15/how-to-photograph-the-northern-lights/</a>), with  minus 25F temperatures and a slight wind blowing, making it around -30F. The combo worked well for me, although there are some drawbacks that I need to advise you of if you will be facing that kind of cold.</p>

<p><a href="http://blog.lesterpickerphoto.com/wp-content/uploads/2011/03/swany-mitten-1-of-1.jpg"><img class="size-medium wp-image-1026" title="swany mitten 1 of 1" src="http://blog.lesterpickerphoto.com/wp-content/uploads/2011/03/swany-mitten-1-of-1-300x225.jpg" alt="" width="300" height="225"></a></p>

<p>First, the good news. The zippers on the Swany mittens allowed me to remove my hand as needed, then slip my fingers back into the mitten to rewarm between shots. The mitten fabrics- there are two varieties available, synthetic and leather- are highly flexible, so they give you a good grip on the camera. Even the synthetic model has a leather palm pad to give you a better grip. Each mitten also sports a terrific fleece snow cuff, which can be drawn tight with their uni-pull mechanism. There is also a customizable quick-release strap on the  back of the hand.</p>

<p>As I mentioned, I’m particularly susceptible to frostbite in my dominant right hand, the one I use for all my camera controls. I found I needed to add a hand-warmer (<a href="http://www.littlehottieswarmers.com">www.littlehottieswarmers.com</a>) to each mitten after I’d been out for an hour, just standing around, waiting for the skies to light up. I buy these hand-warmers by the box at Costco. They are environmentally safe, inexpensive and work like a charm.</p>

<p>If you haven’t experienced the biting cold of -25F or below, suffice it to say it is brutal and unforgiving. You’ve got to be fully prepared. These mittens are not the most insulated in Swany’s line, but they are a great compromise for photography <strong><em>IF</em></strong> used with the hand warmers.</p>

<p>The second caution I would offer is that the zippers on the Swany mittens can be difficult to grip and close while wearing the other mitten in extreme cold. Swany needs to attend to that by perhaps enlarging the zipper or making it more grippable. By the end of my trip, however, I managed to develop a routine that worked for me. Also, remember that a mitten works best if it is not too tight. The air space helps insulate, and you’ll need a little room to allow for the hand warmer, which are pretty slim.</p>

<p>If you want to try the Seirus-Swany solution I developed, you’ll need to choose the Swany Toaster Arctic (TS-16) model. It is strictly a shell-type mitten. The all-leather Toaster Legend II (TS-20) has a built in thin polyester liner glove sewn into the glove, making it impossible to use with the Seirus liner. That would be all well and good if the Swany built-in liner worked for photography. But the liner that comes sewn into the Swany Legend II does not have finger grips, making it difficult to use for controlling the camera wheels and buttons in extreme cold.</p>

<p>All in all, the Swany-Seirus combo worked well for me and I plan to use it in the future. I do think I now have a workable solution for my cold weather jaunts.</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>Don’t say I didn’t warn you!  If you’re shooting landscapes, one of the most effective means of adding interest and impact is to include a foreground element. I know we hear this a lot nowadays, but what I find is that this is usually mentioned as a given, an aside, without providing enough detail for the photographer looking to improve his or her skills. I’m hoping to add flesh to the bones here, so please bear with me.</p>

<p>I believe it was George Lepp who said that there is no such thing as a bad day for a nature (landscape) photographer. After all, even if conditions are miserable, we are out there enjoying beautiful, natural environments. Many is the time I’ve hiked down from a mountain with nary a shot, humbled, and glowing with the feeling of divine grace. So, it’s easy to lose sight of what makes a good image great when faced with that scenic beauty on a lovely day. It’s tempting to just slap on a wide angle lens, screw on a polarizer and snap away. Yes, chances are it will be a lovely shot, but is it the very best image we can create for ourselves or for those who will view our work?</p>

<p>As you study my images that I use as examples in this blog, try to analyze how the foreground elements help (or not) the overall presentation. Most of the time I’m guilty of not shooting comparison images for instructional purposes and I’m guilty of that here. I’ll try to do better on that score this year, but I hope you’ll still understand the basic principles shown by the images in this blog. <strong><em>Remember to click on each image to enlarge it.</em></strong></p>

<p><a href="http://blog.lesterpickerphoto.com/wp-content/uploads/2011/03/Great-Ocean-Road-Victoria-Australia-1102010-11-09.jpg"><img class="size-medium wp-image-998" title="Great Ocean Road, Victoria, Australia 1102010-11-09" src="http://blog.lesterpickerphoto.com/wp-content/uploads/2011/03/Great-Ocean-Road-Victoria-Australia-1102010-11-09-199x300.jpg" alt="" width="199" height="300"></a></p>

<h3>How Foreground Helps</h3>


<p>Foreground helps bring scale and perspective to a scene. It can functionally help by drawing the viewer’s eye into a scene. It can create visual interest by adding texture, an interesting form, or a looming presence. It can even add cognitive dissonance by forcing the viewer to confront paradoxes in perception; viewers may not like the image, but they sure as heck will remember it! In the above scene, I lowered my reference point in an attempt to use the foreground to draw the viewer&#8217;s eyes to the ocean and sky. Similarly with the image below. I stood in the stream and lowered my vantage point to make the rock loom large and point the viewer&#8217;s eyes to the waterfall.</p>

<p><a href="http://blog.lesterpickerphoto.com/wp-content/uploads/2011/03/w-maui-hikers1-Version-2-Version-2.jpg"><img class="size-medium wp-image-999" title="Falling Branch" src="http://blog.lesterpickerphoto.com/wp-content/uploads/2011/03/w-maui-hikers1-Version-2-Version-2-200x300.jpg" alt="" width="200" height="300"></a></p>

<h3>Composing With Foreground Elements</h3>


<p>The first thing with using strong foreground elements is to decide on its placement compositionally. In most cases I find that setting the foreground object(s) off center helps. You want the viewer’s eye to move from foreground to background and if the foreground element is smack-dab in the middle of the frame it can act as a barrier, hindering the eye’s movement through the frame. Placing it ⅓ of the way (remember the Rule of Thirds) into the frame will lead the viewer’s eyes naturally into the background. Here I used the highlights in the seaweed to allow the eye to roam from there to the sky and toward the silhouetted rock on the right.</p>

<p><a href="http://blog.lesterpickerphoto.com/wp-content/uploads/2011/03/Great-Ocean-Road-Victoria-Australia-3372010-11-11-Version-2.jpg"><img class="size-medium wp-image-1000" title="Martyr Bay, Victoria" src="http://blog.lesterpickerphoto.com/wp-content/uploads/2011/03/Great-Ocean-Road-Victoria-Australia-3372010-11-11-Version-2-300x199.jpg" alt="" width="300" height="199"></a></p>

<p>In the next scene, I used a stronger foreground to both anchor the image at the bottom, but also to frame it on the left so that the viewer is lead to the ocean and sunrise sky on the right, as well as the small tide pool that so nicely reflects the sky.</p>

<p><a href="http://blog.lesterpickerphoto.com/wp-content/uploads/2011/03/Great-Ocean-Road-Victoria-Australia-1152010-11-09.jpg"><img class="size-medium wp-image-1001" title="Great Ocean Road, Victoria, Australia 1152010-11-09" src="http://blog.lesterpickerphoto.com/wp-content/uploads/2011/03/Great-Ocean-Road-Victoria-Australia-1152010-11-09-199x300.jpg" alt="" width="199" height="300"></a></p>

<p>This Hawaiian scene was just &#8216;okay,&#8217; but the tree alone against the ocean just didn&#8217;t do it for me. When I backed up, I saw this small rock thrown into deep shadow and I knew I wanted it as a foreground element.</p>

<p><a href="http://blog.lesterpickerphoto.com/wp-content/uploads/2011/03/West-Maui-Mountains-554.jpg"><img class="size-medium wp-image-1004" title="West Maui 554" src="http://blog.lesterpickerphoto.com/wp-content/uploads/2011/03/West-Maui-Mountains-554-199x300.jpg" alt="" width="199" height="300"></a></p>

<h3>Depth of Field Considerations</h3>


<p>Next you need to make a decision on how ‘focal’ the foreground will be in the overall scene. By that I mean, you need to decide on depth of field (DOF). Do you want to throw the background into soft focus, or do you want to have foreground and background all in sharp focus? This question raises the most difficult series of technical challenges to the photographer and here’s why.</p>

<p>For most of my landscapes, I like to have sharp focus throughout the scene, front to back, side to side. That’s just my general preference, although I will alter that for special scenes. To get that front-to-back focus, using a wide-angle lens, I would need to use an aperture opening of f16 or f22, and even then some of the scenes I shoot would not have tack sharp focus in the far background. A lens can only give you so much DOF.</p>

<p>Another challenge I sometimes face with foreground-background focus is that when using f16 or f22 the image displays a decrease of sharpness, or what pros call “softness” in the image. Each lens has an aperture that is optimum, for my lenses usually f11. Anything more than that, while I may gain DOF, I also lose sharpness. Most people would hardly notice, but a sharp-eyed editor will.</p>

<h3>The Foreground Big Gun</h3>


<p>I solve both these problems by using a specialized lens known as a tilt-shift lens or a perspective correcting lens. I’ll discuss those lenses in more depth in a later blog. Suffice it to say that tilt-shift lenses have the ability to shift the plane of focus and make both near and far objects sharp.</p>

<div>

<a href="http://blog.lesterpickerphoto.com/wp-content/uploads/2011/03/353_2168_PCE_NIKKOR24mm_f3.5DED_sidetilt.png"><img class="size-medium wp-image-1013 " title="353_2168_PCE_NIKKOR24mm_f3.5DED_sidetilt" src="http://blog.lesterpickerphoto.com/wp-content/uploads/2011/03/353_2168_PCE_NIKKOR24mm_f3.5DED_sidetilt-300x254.png" alt="" width="300" height="254"></a>

</div>


<p>The end result is that I’m able to get a landscape image that is to my liking.I used a tilt-shift in this black &amp; white image to capture everything in focus from foreground to background.</p>

<p><a href="http://blog.lesterpickerphoto.com/wp-content/uploads/2011/03/CaRockies2009-Route-742-Spray-Lake-Kananaskis-country-7-of-11.jpg"><img class="size-medium wp-image-1005" title="CaRockies2009-Route 742-Spray Lake, Kananaskis country 7 of 11" src="http://blog.lesterpickerphoto.com/wp-content/uploads/2011/03/CaRockies2009-Route-742-Spray-Lake-Kananaskis-country-7-of-11-300x199.jpg" alt="" width="300" height="199"></a></p>

<h3>Foreground Works With People, Too</h3>


<p>Don&#8217;t forget that foreground elements work when photographing people, too, as this next image shows. I wanted this image to portray this Ecuadorean woman in the context of her livelihood and culture. The bananas in the foreground make the visual statement I was looking for, but it is the woman&#8217;s facial expression that does it for me.</p>

<p><a href="http://blog.lesterpickerphoto.com/wp-content/uploads/2011/03/ecuadorbananalady.jpg"><img class="size-medium wp-image-1010" title="ecuadorbananalady" src="http://blog.lesterpickerphoto.com/wp-content/uploads/2011/03/ecuadorbananalady-201x300.jpg" alt="" width="201" height="300"></a></p>

<h3>Use a Tripod</h3>


<p>Whatever equipment you use, a regular lens or a tilt-shift, to properly use foreground elements, you really need to use a tripod. I explain this in detail in another blog (<a href="http://blog.lesterpickerphoto.com/2010/12/15/tripod-or-lens/">http://blog.lesterpickerphoto.com/2010/12/15/tripod-or-lens/</a>). When you think of it seriously, you can understand my rationale. To include strong foreground elements you have to compose the scene properly, critically focus on the foreground object(s) and then stop down (reduce the aperture opening of) your lens. Reducing the aperture means you have to increase the exposure time. Now, try doing all that while hand-holding a camera! The blurry results will make all your efforts wasted.</p>

<p>Then again, there are times when it all comes together for the photographer, as happened to me on this sunset in Kahana, Maui, Hawaii. I had come back to this same spot four sunsets in a row until I finally got this scene. The sunset alone would have been lovely, as attested to by perhaps a dozen or more tourists who were on the sandy beach to the right of where I took this image. They probably thought I was nuts, climbing down from a parking area to these rocks to set up my tripod. I set my camera for a long, 20-second exposure, allowing the ebb and flow of the tide to soften the water. But I truly feel it is the rocks in the foreground that make the shot. For me, anyway, it was a perfect night.</p>

<p><a href="http://blog.lesterpickerphoto.com/wp-content/uploads/2011/03/West-Maui-Mountains-575.jpg"><img class="size-medium wp-image-1006" title="Maui 575" src="http://blog.lesterpickerphoto.com/wp-content/uploads/2011/03/West-Maui-Mountains-575-199x300.jpg" alt="" width="199" height="300"></a></p>

<p>One of my favorite photographers using strong foreground elements is the noted Canadian landscape photographer Darwin Wiggett. Take a gander at how he uses foreground elements to anchor his landscapes and you’ll understand how a master photographer works. Try this one: <a href="http://www.darwinwiggett.com/photo.php?id=663&amp;gallery=winter">http://www.darwinwiggett.com/photo.php?id=663&amp;gallery=winter</a> or this one: <a href="http://www.darwinwiggett.com/photo.php?id=662&amp;gallery=winter">http://www.darwinwiggett.com/photo.php?id=662&amp;gallery=winter</a> for starters.</p>

<p>By all means include strong foreground elements in your images, but be forewarned. Arrive prepared and it will make the job far easier and much more rewarding.</p>
