  <div class="entry-content"><p>Well, we finally made it Down Under, but let’s just say it wasn’t exactly uneventful. We were up at 6:00 AM, needing to do umpteen things prior to our afternoon flight. Flying  from BWI to Toronto on Air Canada on a Havilland Dash propeller plane was uneventful, as was our brief layover.</p>

<p>Our cross-country flight to Vancouver was quite pleasant, mostly due to a terrific flight crew who were collectively attentive and engaging. Then we descended into Vancouver International, precisely at the same moment that a large bird decided to greet us, a bit too enthusiastically. Pop! and there went one of our engines. We landed safely, but after waiting until 3:00 AM (east coast time), we were informed that the engine was too badly damaged to continue on.</p>

<p>Air Canada was wonderful in terms of keeping us constantly informed. Once the decision was made to cancel, they pulled in resources to get us processed. Unfortunately, we had to go up and down escalators and walk across the airport to reclaim our luggage, go back to ticketing, get re-ticketed for a morning flight, receive our hotel, taxi and meal vouchers and try to grab a few hours sleep.</p>

<p><a href="http://blog.lesterpickerphoto.com/wp-content/uploads/2010/10/vancouver-aiport-142010-10-22.jpg"><img class="size-medium wp-image-655" title="vancouver aiport 142010-10-22" src="http://blog.lesterpickerphoto.com/wp-content/uploads/2010/10/vancouver-aiport-142010-10-22-300x199.jpg" alt="" width="300" height="199"></a></p>

<p>We were back in the airport at 8:30 AM. Fortunately for me, my wife is absolutely the best travel companion, so we tend to look at these travel hiccups as part of the adventure. And, sure enough, our gate agent that morning was Francis, a supervisor who has helped me before in transit through Vancouver. We greeted each other with smiles and a handshake, he gave us another meal voucher and we traded email contact info. I’ll probably see him again when I head up to the Yukon this February (brrrr!!) to shoot the Quest dogsled race. And that’s the thing I’d like to focus on in this blog; how having a mindset that looks at every travel challenge as an opportunity is really the only way to go.</p>

<p>All around us during this delay we saw several truly unhappy people. Not that I fault them. Delays, when you’re already tired and stressed from air travel, is no fun. But, what is, is. You can’t change these things, so just go with the flow. Look around; make a friend; reach out; trade business cards, talk about your respective kids, whatever. Being miserable is a choice.</p>

<p>Now here’s the next opportunity for us. Vancouver happens to be one of my favorite airports. It’s light and airy. It has free Wifi. There are so many eateries I always have a hard time choosing and they’re spread out so that you don’t feel as if you are at a mall. You can choose to eat around crowds, or find a nice private spot, you can do fast food or sit down at a restaurant.</p>

<p><a href="http://blog.lesterpickerphoto.com/wp-content/uploads/2010/10/vancouver-aiport-122010-10-22.jpg"><img class="size-medium wp-image-656" title="vancouver aiport 122010-10-22" src="http://blog.lesterpickerphoto.com/wp-content/uploads/2010/10/vancouver-aiport-122010-10-22-199x300.jpg" alt="" width="199" height="300"></a></p>

<p>Best of all, Vancouver airport has lots of wonderful educational opportunities. Sprinkled throughout are exhibits of the region’s natural history. There are sculptures and exhibits about indigenous peoples. So there we were, tired and hungry, walking to our gate, when we came upon a huge, two-story vertical aquarium that I hadn’t seen before. Surprise! We stopped and watched the exhibit of local fish, anemones, starfish, kelp and sea urchins. What a rejuvenating experience, one we would not have had if our plane had not been delayed. We had a snack, watching people watching the aquarium display.</p>

<p>In my next blog I’ll share some first impressions about Australia.</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>We’re ready to leave and I’ve already given instructions to our house sitter… multiple times (I’m beginning to envy his carefree life over the course of our trip).</p>

<p>It’s T-minus-2 days. The Australia and Fiji segments are wrapped up, leaving just a few loose ends on our New Zealand adventure. I’m determined to allow that part of the trip to stay loose, in order to take advantage of the photo ops that present themselves.</p>

<p>Right now I’m doing my photo organizing and cleaning. I like to start a trip with clean equipment, so I can amass a rich and diverse collection of dust spots on my sensor as I travel. I mean, what else would I do with my time at night in my hotel room when I’m dead tired other than clean my equipment in dim lighting?</p>

<p>Since this trip is so long and will involve hiking to some remote locations, I have to limit my equipment. You can see from the photo some of what I’ve decided to take along. Most of that equipment will have to fit tightly into my ThinkTank photo backpack (see my previous blog on the backpack I’ll be taking: <a href="http://blog.lesterpickerphoto.com/2009/05/25/transporting-your-gear/">http://blog.lesterpickerphoto.com/2009/05/25/transporting-your-gear/</a>).</p>

<p>My equipment includes:</p>

<p>Manfrotto all-purpose clamp-on flash thigamajig</p>

<p>Dry bags, cleaning supplies, flash accessories, electronic “stuff,” a pound of assorted batteries, etc.</p>

<p>Of course, the photo here does not include my laptop, extra battery, mouse, case and accessories, nor specialized clothing like photo vests or ScotteVest jackets  (<a href="http://blog.lesterpickerphoto.com/2010/09/19/invest-in-evest-scottevest-that-is/">http://blog.lesterpickerphoto.com/2010/09/19/invest-in-evest-scottevest-that-is/</a>).</p>

<p>I’ll probably blog next from Vancouver airport (free Wifi!!), showing my tidy backpack, assuming TSA or the airline hasn’t confiscated it by then.</p>

<p>Have a wonderful few weeks, everyone, and don’t forget to follow my blogs from Down Under, ask questions, give advice, state opinions… whatever. I&#8217;ll also be providing mini-reviews of sites, events, hotels and restaurants, so be prepared to save the blogs if a trip Down Under is on your bucket list.</p>

<p>Best Wishes,</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>To my blog readers:</p>

<p>I&#8217;m excited to announce that I was just chosen to be the new photography columnist for ScotteVest.</p>

<p><a href="http://blog.lesterpickerphoto.com/wp-content/uploads/2010/10/pro_photographers_01_page1.jpg"><img class="aligncenter size-medium wp-image-642" title="pro_photographers_01_page" src="http://blog.lesterpickerphoto.com/wp-content/uploads/2010/10/pro_photographers_01_page1-300x111.jpg" alt="" width="300" height="111"></a></p>

<p>If you haven&#8217;t seen their Internet presence yet, you probably are not an outdoorsy-type, since they advertise heavily online. ScotteVest manufactures some of the finest travel and outdoor clothing I have ever had the joy of owning. Their claim to fame is the number of pockets built into their clothing and their durable construction. In fact, it was my use of their product that drew us together (<a href="http://blog.lesterpickerphoto.com/2010/09/19/invest-in-evest-scottevest-that-is/">http://blog.lesterpickerphoto.com/2010/09/19/invest-in-evest-scottevest-that-is/</a>).</p>

<p>I have used ScotteVest products for quite a while now and have been impressed with their design and construction. For the photographer, their clothing has just about everything we could want, especially POCKETS&#8230; tons and tons of pockets in which to place all the accessories we carry around.</p>

<p>In any event, I&#8217;m proud to be associated with this fine product and its founder, Scott Jordan. Visit my column on their site and then be sure to browse their product line (<a href="http://www.scottevest.com/company/photography.shtml">http://www.scottevest.com/company/photography.shtml</a>).</p>

<p>I would also love to hear from you about your candid experiences with ScotteVest products as a traveler and as a photographer.</p>

<p>Happy travels! Happy shooting!</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>Okay, so the Australia-Fiji-New Zealand trip and assignment is exactly 15 days off and I’m feeling rattled. A few items in the itinerary have been nailed down since my last blog post, but there’s a heckuva lot more to go.</p>

<p>So far I have the flights to and from Australia and New Zealand finalized, as well as one flight within Australia. Getting to Fiji has been set for months. I’ve got two car rentals arranged and a couple of nice lodging properties lined up and almost finalized, a good thing since I’m doing several travel articles/photojournalism pieces. But I figure I still have at least 60% of the arrangements left to make, particularly for properties around New Zealand’s southwest coast (Fiordland National Park region). I have numerous leads out there, but they haven’t been finalized.</p>

<p>For those of you who think you’d relish the life of a travel photojournalist, this is the part I dread. Sure, the travel itself is nice; the eye candy of amazing new landscapes, meeting fascinating people, sampling new foods. But getting there entails myriad details that take entirely too much time and energy to set up. At times like this I wish I had an assistant to nail these details, but I often end up deciding on last-minute, must-photograph locations, adding or subtracting hotels… you get the picture. The end result is a frustrated assistant. Better to do it myself (although I’m always on the lookout for that ‘perfect’ assistant who can take charge and run with it).</p>

<p>I’m also thinking about photo equipment I need to take; cameras, lenses, accessories. This is not an idle exercise, since Australian airlines charge $10 for every kilo (2.2 pounds) above 20 kilos of checked baggage within country and a whopping $20 per kilo for flights to New Zealand! That would easily add hundreds of dollars to my fares.</p>

<p>I’ve also got to consider how I’ll transport my gear, both while traveling and hiking to remote locations. I prefer to use my <em>ThinkTank</em> wheeling camera bag for air/train/ship travel, but I probably won’t be able to take that <strong><em>and</em></strong> my <em>ThinkTank</em> Rotation 360 backpack. I’ll keep you posted on my final decisions in an upcoming blog.</p>

<p>A couple of weeks ago I started training at my gym for my excursion. Most people don’t think of this when they think ‘photojournalist,’ but the work can be physically demanding. I carry 30-40 pounds of equipment with me to remote locations, so I have to stay in shape. Typically, beginning a month prior to a major trip I’ll go to my gym three or four times a week dressed in my hiking clothes, and walk the treadmill for an hour or two, varying the up and down hill inclines throughout. I carry my full photo backpack. I’m sure I look like a total dork but, hey, someone’s got to play the role. (In the accompanying photo I&#8217;m using the ThinkTank Rotation 360)</p>

<p><a href="http://blog.lesterpickerphoto.com/wp-content/uploads/2010/10/lesontreadmill-1-of-1.jpg"><img class="size-medium wp-image-616" title="lesontreadmill 1 of 1" src="http://blog.lesterpickerphoto.com/wp-content/uploads/2010/10/lesontreadmill-1-of-1-225x300.jpg" alt="" width="225" height="300"></a></p>

<p>P.S.: As of yesterday an arrangement in New Zealand I was counting on fell through, so I’ve got to start that segment again from scratch!</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>Ever watch a pro or advanced amateur photographer at work? Chances are you’ve noticed that almost all of them share a twitch of sorts. It goes something like this: camera hangs on a strap on their left shoulder… up goes their right hand… grab strap at shoulder… pull up as left shoulder simultaneously rises and left arm juts out a bit to help out… put right hand back down… repeat every 60 seconds.</p>

<p>What I’m referring to here is camera strap slippage (not related to George Castanza’s shrinkage problem, mind you). Camera strap slippage is an especially frustrating affliction for someone like me with sloping shoulders. For decades I have struggled with constantly having to hoist my camera strap back up on my shoulder. In fact, take a look at this collection of straps and this is after I have sold or given away at least a dozen others over the years.</p>

<p><a href="http://blog.lesterpickerphoto.com/wp-content/uploads/2010/09/straps-1-of-1.jpg"><img class="aligncenter size-medium wp-image-609" title="straps 1 of 1" src="http://blog.lesterpickerphoto.com/wp-content/uploads/2010/09/straps-1-of-1-199x300.jpg" alt="" width="199" height="300"></a></p>

<p>Well, folks, not anymore. About five years ago I discovered UPStrap, manufactured by an interested guy in Florida, Al Stegmeyer (<a href="http://www.upstrap-pro.com">www.upstrap-pro.com</a>). I know it sounds completely stupid, but this strap has changed my photography. A couple of months after buying it my wife noticed that I wasn’t twitching constantly while hiking with my cameras. This is the honest truth; the neck pain that I used to have from keeping my shoulder propped up all day while photographing is gone!</p>

<p><a href="http://blog.lesterpickerphoto.com/wp-content/uploads/2010/09/slr_kevlar_black_sm.jpg"><img class="aligncenter size-medium wp-image-610" title="slr_kevlar_black_sm" src="http://blog.lesterpickerphoto.com/wp-content/uploads/2010/09/slr_kevlar_black_sm-254x300.jpg" alt="" width="254" height="300"></a></p>

<p>I own three UPStraps now. They’re made of an incredible new-fangled rubber compound with little nubs on it that stick to your shoulder like glue and feel like nothing&#8217;s there. I put a camera on my shoulder and forget it. That thing won’t come off even if you accidentally knock into someone. They are a bit pricey, but I haven’t had to replace one yet, and I’m in some pretty difficult locations for equipment, from the Sahara to the Arctic.</p>

<p>What made me think of the UPStrap is a recent email I got from Al, advising me that there was a potential problem with the stitching where the strap attaches to the camera. I was asked to go to their site if I wanted replacements, which I immediately did. In a few days I received a package with replacements and a request from Al to please return the old ones for analysis and credit from his factory.</p>

<p>There are so few people who are committed to excellence in product construction and customer service nowadays. Obviously Al comes to mind, as does Bob Singh of Singh-Ray filters (more on him in a future blog). Once I called Al to discuss a technical issue I faced while photographing on a tripod in moderate wind. I wondered, with all the straps and buckles and snaps he used in his product line, if there might be something he could do to fix the problem. He’d think about it. In three days I received a package in the mail from Al with a solution.</p>

<p>So, do yourself a favor. If you suffer from camera strap slippage, visit the UPStrap website and treat yourself to a great product.</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>One of the hassles of travel for me is toting around an entire file folder of flight, hotel and rental car confirmations. Why do the confirmations have to be 5 pages long? Even if I print only the first page, on a 3-4 week assignment that frequently entails 30-40 pages of confirmations.</p>

<p>Enter the niftiest iPod Touch (also iPhone and iPad) app I have ever seen. It’s called TripIt and I’ve fallen in love with it. Here’s what it does and how it works.</p>

<p><a href="http://blog.lesterpickerphoto.com/wp-content/uploads/2010/09/images1.jpeg"><img class="aligncenter size-medium wp-image-602" title="images" src="http://blog.lesterpickerphoto.com/wp-content/uploads/2010/09/images1-300x160.jpg" alt="" width="300" height="160"></a></p>

<p>Basically, TripIt creates a complete itinerary of your trip and makes it available on your iPod, iPhone or iPad (it may also do Windows-based systems, but I’m not sure). I do mean complete, from flight info to hotels, rental cars, events, whatever. Since I use Apple’s Mobile Me, it automatically and wirelessly syncs my iPod Touch, laptop and desktop as soon as I make a change on any device. Mobile Me also stores the information in the “cloud” so I can retrieve it in the unlikely event of a systems crash or a stolen or broken device.</p>

<p>What is most amazing of all is that once you register, all you need to do is forward your confirmation emails to TripIt and it automagically adds them to your itinerary! You just forward it to <a href="mailto:plan@tripit.com">plan@tripit.com</a>. That’s it. No subject heading to add, not even one word of explanation. It detects from your email address that the confirmation is for your itinerary and that’s it. In seconds it pops up on your TripIt itinerary. This thing is so complete, it even includes your departure gate, synced to your mobile device as soon as the airline releases it.</p>

<p>The itinerary includes your confirmation number, reservation number, addresses of hotels. Amazingly, TripIt simultaneously downloads a Google map of the area, with a pin showing the location of your hotel or car rental agency! Plus, it adds a constantly updated weather report for each stop in your itinerary.</p>

<p><a href="http://blog.lesterpickerphoto.com/wp-content/uploads/2010/09/images-1.jpeg"><img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-603" title="images-1" src="http://blog.lesterpickerphoto.com/wp-content/uploads/2010/09/images-1.jpeg" alt="" width="183" height="275"></a></p>

<p>If you are staying in a tiny lodge in the bush somewhere, and TripIt can’t decipher their confirmation email (or if the lodge doesn’t send one), you can add to your itinerary manually. I’m loving this thing. No more carrying around reams of paper. Everything in one place, available in a tap and swipe.</p>

<p>You can have multiple trips going at once. TripIt even keeps track of every one of your airline miles accounts.</p>

<p>Okay now, I saved the best for last. The cost of this app is a big, fat 0. Zilch, nadda, zip (there is a premium version called TripIt Pro that goes for $49 a year and includes lots of power features, but I don’t use it… yet). Go to TripIt.com for more info and an entertaining video.</p>

<p><strong><em>Addendum (June, 2011)</em></strong>: I decided to purchase the Pro version and I love it. The more traveling you do, the more value you&#8217;ll get from the Pro version of this app.</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>Every so often a product appears in the marketplace that makes you think: Why didn’t someone think of that sooner?</p>

<p>That’s how I felt the first time I used a ScotteVest product, the brainchild of founder Scott Jordan. Scottevest (www.scottevest.com) is a line of clothing designed for people who embrace an active lifestyle. The pants, shirts, vests and jackets are ruggedly constructed of lightweight materials, but any similarity to standard outdoors wear ends there. In my quest to share great products with my readers— products that I actually use— I’d like to give you this heads-up.</p>

<p>The secret to the ScotteVest line is in the astounding number of pockets hidden throughout the garments. My jacket (the Quantum; now discontinued), has something like 25 pockets, no exaggeration! My TEC shirt has 8 pockets. But think again if you believe their clothing looks like a dorky photo vest. ScotteVest designers have put together well-styled and durable garments with thoughtfully placed pockets.</p>

<p><a href="http://blog.lesterpickerphoto.com/wp-content/uploads/2010/09/pocketmap_packw_reg.jpg"><img class="size-medium wp-image-593" title="pocketmap_packw_reg" src="http://blog.lesterpickerphoto.com/wp-content/uploads/2010/09/pocketmap_packw_reg-300x161.jpg" alt="" width="300" height="161"></a></p>

<p>Take my jacket, for example. In the late fall, winter and early spring I use it almost exclusively for my photo forays. It is water resistant, has a removable hood, adjustable sleeves, draw cords, armpit vents and a breathable mesh lining. But here’s the winning formula for photographers; it is lined with pockets for every gadget you could possibly carry. I have separate pockets for my right angle viewers (2), my Lee filter holder, filters, shutter release cords, memory cards, 2-3 lenses, a point-and-shoot, etc. The jacket, like many of their jackets in their current product line, has 2 chest pockets specifically designed to fit an iPod, iPhone or smartphone. The high-tech materials lining those pockets are completely see-through, so I’m able to make calls, run my photo apps, or follow a map without taking them out of the pockets.</p>

<p>There are other perks for photographers. My jacket has a shock cord and clip in one of the pockets with a microfiber cloth attached! There is a pocket for business cards, pens, pencils and Lenspens. One pocket has an extendable key holder. When I leave the house I clip my keys to it and don&#8217;t have to worry about losing them in a bog. Another feature is an internal wiring system through which you string your earphones, connect it to your phone or iPod and make calls or listen to music.</p>

<p>Interestingly, the entire jacket is so well balanced (they call it their Weight Management System) I’m hardly aware of all the photo junk I’m packing. I just load up, sling my Gitzo with attached camera over my shoulder and I’m off.</p>

<p>I’d be remiss if I didn’t mention a shortcoming, although it’s kind of a moot point, given that my jacket is now discontinued. To be a perfect photo jacket I would have preferred one large flap-type pocket on each side of the jacket to hold a camera body or medium lens. I’m hoping that ScotteVest’s designers will make a dedicated photo vest in the future; I’m sure it would be a winner.</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>For me, one of the joys of writing a blog, or teaching a workshop, is the opportunity to pass on knowledge that I’ve gained from 40 years in the field, as well as learn from others and make new friends.</p>

<p>There are some aspects of photography that I do not consider my area of expertise. I think of people like Bob Boyer (http://photo.rwboyer.com/), who is a true expert in photographic lighting, post-processing and the technical aspects of photography (aside from being an Aperture guru). His expertise on Aperture (and Photoshop) draws thousands of fans every month to his blog site. So, I rely on Bob, for example, and will sometimes refer a blog reader’s question to him for a response.</p>

<p><a href="http://blog.lesterpickerphoto.com/wp-content/uploads/2010/09/Les-Costa-Rica-1-of-1.jpg"><img class="size-medium wp-image-589" title="Les-Costa Rica 1 of 1" src="http://blog.lesterpickerphoto.com/wp-content/uploads/2010/09/Les-Costa-Rica-1-of-1-300x199.jpg" alt="" width="300" height="199"></a></p>

<p>But, I think I have enough knowledge about nature, wildlife and landscape photography, as well as diverse experiences in the field, to answer your questions. So, fire away! If I’m not sure of the answer, I’ll ask a colleague to guest answer and/or also throw open the question to readers for their solutions. Go ahead; ask a question. Get the discussions going. I dare you!</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>Right now I’m in the throes of prepping for a month-long assignment that will take me to Australia, Fiji, and New Zealand, three places on my bucket list that I’ve never visited before. As with my recent Canadian Rockies adventure, I plan to blog my way through this.</p>

<p><a href="http://blog.lesterpickerphoto.com/wp-content/uploads/2010/09/newzealandmap_medium_en.jpg"><img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-578" title="newzealandmap_medium_en" src="http://blog.lesterpickerphoto.com/wp-content/uploads/2010/09/newzealandmap_medium_en.jpg" alt="" width="240" height="267"></a></p>

<p>First, if any of you have favorite photo spots in any of these places, please let me know. Our plan is to fly to Sydney and spend several days driving along the coast to Brisbane and back, writing and photographing along the way. Then we’ll cruise from Sydney to Fiji and back, while I teach aboard ship. Next we’ll fly to Melbourne, where I’ll focus (get the bad pun?) on photography along the coast. Finally, we’ll fly to New Zealand’s South Island and spend two weeks photographing, mostly along the southwestern coast in Fjordland National Park and other locations.</p>

<p><a href="http://blog.lesterpickerphoto.com/wp-content/uploads/2010/09/Australia_map_full.jpg"><img class="aligncenter size-medium wp-image-582" title="Australia_map_full" src="http://blog.lesterpickerphoto.com/wp-content/uploads/2010/09/Australia_map_full-300x293.jpg" alt="" width="300" height="293"></a></p>

<p>As a travel and nature photojournalist, the biggest ordeal for me is the preparation. I dread having to make all the flight arrangements, constructing each leg so that it dovetails with the next and often finding that “I can’t get there from here.” Then it’s write down the times and connections, rework it to synch with a flight that only happens twice a week, then rework again because you can’t get back in time for the return flight. There have been times I’ve had to cancel an entire destination because I knew that spending only a day or two would have been too harried and frustrating.</p>

<p><a href="http://blog.lesterpickerphoto.com/wp-content/uploads/2010/09/fiji-map.gif"><img class="aligncenter size-medium wp-image-583" title="fiji-map" src="http://blog.lesterpickerphoto.com/wp-content/uploads/2010/09/fiji-map-300x211.gif" alt="" width="300" height="211"></a></p>

<p>As of now I’ve got our flights on Air Canada arranged. That’s one area of prep I don’t have to agonize over. Air Canada is my little secret. If they fly to where I’m going, I’m usually on one of their planes. Since I’ve been photographing a lot in Canada, I’ve gotten to know them. The flight attendants are friendly and efficient, the planes are clean and I love the fact that every seat on their big jets has a 120-volt receptacle. I can get tons of work done, especially on cross country or international flights.</p>

<p>I’m just six weeks out from the start of the journey and I still haven’t: booked my domestic Australian flights, my flight from Australia to New Zealand, any guides I might hire to get to great photo spots, lodging, or car rentals. I haven’t even finalized the list of places I want to visit for travel writing and/or photography. Damn! Stay tuned.</p>
