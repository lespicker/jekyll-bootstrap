  <div class="entry-content"><p>Just a quick travel vignette. While touring Sri Lanka, I visited a temple complex. Often these temples are located in rural or suburban areas and have an endemic monkey population. Since the country is primarily Buddhist, people and our near relatives coexist very peacefully.</p>

<p><a href="http://blog.lesterpickerphoto.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/04/A0018443.jpg"><img class="size-medium wp-image-2050" title="A0018443" src="http://blog.lesterpickerphoto.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/04/A0018443-300x209.jpg" alt="" width="300" height="209"></a></p>

<p>That peace and harmony was broken by a women who went to retrieve her wandering toddler, mistakenly leaving her pocketbook behind. In the blink of an eye, a silver langur swung down and snatched the purse. When the woman ran after it, the offending primate jumped into a tree and sat on a branch. As we watched, he rummaged through her purse, dropping all manner of items to the ground, some of them, shall I say, of a personal nature. The poor woman was embarrassed, but also laughing. When the critter was left with an empty bag, he sniffed it to see if any vestige of food escaped his TSA-like hand check. When he found none, he simply dropped the pocketbook on the ground and scanned the tide of humans for his next victim.</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>I&#8217;ve been asked what a typical Sri Lankan town is like, so I&#8217;m including <a href="http://youtu.be/8TED1BbGqZU">this short video</a> taken as we drove through a modest one in the central region.</p>

<p>A typical village would be much smaller, with perhaps one or two tiny retail stores offering basic essentials. However, every town and village appears to be bursting at the seems with fresh vegetables and fruits, rice and other staples.</p>

<p><a href="http://blog.lesterpickerphoto.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/04/A0018626.jpg"><img class="size-medium wp-image-2062 " title="A0018626" src="http://blog.lesterpickerphoto.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/04/A0018626-300x225.jpg" alt="" width="300" height="225"></a></p>

<p>Note that many women walk with umbrellas in the scorching heat. Also note the multi-colored tuk-tuks in the video. Tuk-tuks are a primary form of transportation in poor towns and villages and in large cities with lots of traffic congestion. These highly maneuverable 3-wheeled vehicles can carry up to 5 or 6 passengers, although the usual is 1 or 2. The fares are generally very modest, but even so most Sri Lankans walk great distances to purchase basic items.</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>I&#8217;m traveling through Sri Lanka (literal translation: Jewel of the Indian Ocean), where Internet access is spotty at best, so this will be the first of several short blogs.</p>

<p>Driving through the countryside in the central area of Sri Lanka, there is much agriculture, especially rice paddies. Often you will see these structures in the fields.</p>

<p><a href="http://blog.lesterpickerphoto.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/04/watchtower.jpg"><img class="size-medium wp-image-2042" title="watchtower" src="http://blog.lesterpickerphoto.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/04/watchtower-300x225.jpg" alt="" width="300" height="225"></a></p>

<p>Any idea what it is you are looking at? <strong>Hint</strong>: There are usually four of them, one in each corner of a field.</p>

<p>ANSWER: This is a watchtower. At night hired workers will mouth these towers, protecting the fields from wild elephants and wild boars, both of which can devastate a crop in a couple of hours. The men will sing all night long, chant Buddhist prayers and otherwise keep themselves awake.  With approximately 6,000 wild elephants, Sri Lankans appear to live in peaceful co-existence with their wild animal brethren.</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>And what a journey it&#8217;s been! From the time I left BWI airport until I checked into my hotel in Sri Lanka, 31 hours had elapsed; 34 hours bed to bed. That is one l-o-n-g trip. The only saving grace was that Emirate Airlines was wonderful, with attentive service even in economy. My longest flight segment, 12-1/2 hours, was only 1/2 full, so I was able to sleep on and off, something I’m rarely able to accomplish in the air unless I get lucky and land a business class upgrade.</p>

<p><a href="http://blog.lesterpickerphoto.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/03/CameraAwesome-bwi.jpg"><img class="size-medium wp-image-2039" title="CameraAwesome-bwi" src="http://blog.lesterpickerphoto.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/03/CameraAwesome-bwi-300x224.jpg" alt="" width="300" height="224"></a></p>

<p>I left Baltimore just four days after returning from Israel with a very bad cough and congestion. In retrospect, I probably should have cancelled the Sri Lanka trip because I was absolutely miserable on the trip. Understandably, two people in nearby seats asked to have their seats changed due to my incessant coughing.</p>

<p>My flight included a layover in Dubai, but the desert sands gave us only a brown-fog view of its immense structures. The airport in Dubai is state-of-the-art modern, with the stores crowded so close together it gives one the feeling of a souk.</p>

<p>I arrived in Columbo, Sri Lanka exhausted. The temperature today was 88F and very humid, with the sun so strong I could hardly stay under it for more than a few minutes at a time. Hopefully, it will do wonders for my cough. In any event, the adventure begins.</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>On my recent Israel trip I have been in Tel Aviv, Jaffa and several locations in the Golan Heights in northern Israel, as well as Jerusalem and its surrounds. I visited so many archaeological sites, I’m suffering from overload (and also from a wicked cough and cold, so please accept my apologies for not blogging in a week!).</p>

<p>Since Israel is such an iconic destination and since so much has already been written about it, I’ll only add my two cents in the form of observations and impressions. I’ll leave political discussions for the experts who, by the way, have not managed to solve one big issue regarding Israel and the Palestinians in 50 years!</p>

<h3>You’ve Been Where?</h3>


<p>It’s true that you can drive from the most northerly point in Israel to its southern border in just six hours. Across its widest point it is no more than a 90 minute drive.</p>

<p>What that means is that you can cover a lot of territory in a fairly short amount of time. If your friends express skepticism that you could visit so many places in week or two, take out a map (or your iPhone) and show them just how tiny Israel really is. In fact, Israel is only the size of New Jersey, except in Israel’s case somehow it got squeezed in the center (not so good for its security).</p>

<p>My point is that Israel is much smaller than I ever imagined, a view shared by many other tourists with whom I chatted.</p>

<h3>Be Prepared to be Amazed</h3>


<p>Israel is at the crossroads of cultures. and civilizations. The Jewish people, who have been here for thousands of years, have seen Greeks and Romans, Babylonians and Turks, Macedonians and British conquer and then lose their hold on this land. As each new master came and went, they left their mark in the form of buildings, ideas, culture and people. You’re constantly sampling from a historical smorgasbord as you visit sites here.</p>

<p><a href="http://blog.lesterpickerphoto.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/03/A0018222.jpg"><img class="size-medium wp-image-2035" title="A0018222" src="http://blog.lesterpickerphoto.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/03/A0018222-223x300.jpg" alt="" width="223" height="300"></a></p>

<h3>Contrast Central</h3>


<p>If there is any nation on earth that has more contrasts than Israel, I dare you to show it to me. Nowhere else that I have been has such massive amounts of antiquity been situated next door to such modernity. Doubt it? Just visit Caesarea where the ancient Roman fortress sits next door to a power plant, or Safed, where modern shops are seamlessly woven through ancient Roman aqueducts and restored architecture. Or Jerusalem, where it’s hard to take a decent picture in the Old City without including a satellite dish, electrical wires or a sign.</p>

<p>There is more. Where else can the Ultra-religious survive comfortably within such a modern and secular society? Where else in the Middle East can you find Arabs living peacefully with Jews and Christians in a democracy (and with equal citizenship rights)? Yet squalor sometimes sits next to modern, high rise hotels. Go figure.</p>

<p>Finally, Israel is mostly desert, yet its per capita agricultural production and efficiency are among the highest of any nation on earth. They have perfected the drip irrigation system and export that technology worldwide. Everywhere I traveled, whether city or rural, drip lines extend through commercial plantings, private gardens and huge fields.</p>

<h3>Graffiti</h3>


<p>I simply was not prepared for the profusion of graffiti scrawled on clean walls and streets throughout Tel Aviv and Jerusalem. Not artistic graffiti, which I detest anyway because of the way it affronts one’s sensibilities and ruins the architecture. No, the graffiti I saw in Israel was nothing short of vandalism, plain and simple.</p>

<h3>Leave Your Biblical Impressions At Home</h3>


<p>I’m amazed at how my biblical references were turned upside down during my visit. The mighty Sea of Galilee that we read about in the Bible is nothing more than a fairly small lake. In fact, the Romans called it Lake Tiberias. Ancient synagogues of note would easily fit into the living rooms of many respectably-sized American houses. Judging from the living areas and low archways, the heroes of the Bible were rather short. And, most disappointing of all was the mighty and wide Jordan River. In reality it is a narrow, muddy creek.</p>

<h3>A Vibrant Economy</h3>


<p>During my visit you’d hardly know that the world is in recession. Building is going on everywhere, with huge cranes dominating the city skylines. High tech is huge in Israel, with many of the patents for the gadgets we love originating in this tiny country. As a result, Microsoft, Intel, Apple and other high-tech giants maintain research campuses in Israel. Their highly educated workforce propels their economy.</p>

<p><a href="http://blog.lesterpickerphoto.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/03/A0018139-Edit.jpg"><img class="size-medium wp-image-2034" title="A0018139-Edit" src="http://blog.lesterpickerphoto.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/03/A0018139-Edit-300x225.jpg" alt="" width="300" height="225"></a></p>

<h3>Diversity Rules</h3>


<p>Israel appears to my eyes to be as diverse a democracy as I could imagine. First, of course, is the diversity within the Jewish community. The Ultra-Orthodox live side by side with secular Jews who embrace their culture but do not put a lot of emphasis on their faith. On  the Jewish Sabbath I saw every sect racing past each other on the way to their respective houses of worship.</p>

<p>Then, on Sunday, Old Jerusalem was packed with Christian worshippers of every persuasion rushing to services. Greek Orthodox, Roman Catholic, Armenian Orthodox, and every Protestant denomination you can think of, all with free and unfettered access to their holy places.</p>

<p>Every day, five times a day, the city’s minarets blare out their call to prayer over ramped-up loudspeakers. Here, Israeli Arabs enjoy freedoms unimagined in the rest of the Arab world. Of course there are still issues of equity, as there are in every democracy on earth, but in Israel there are forums in which to address them.</p>

<h3>A Half-Dozen Tips for visiting Israel</h3>


<p>1.Hire a good guide. Get recommendations. Search the web. Do your due diligence. Whether on a tour or one-on-one, a good guide will make a world of difference. Plus, there is so much history, only a good guide will be able to tie it all together.</p>

<p>2. Try the falafel. Even if you have tried falafel and hated it in the U.S., try it again here. Falafel reigns supreme in Israel and it is very, very good; fresh ingredients, deeply fried, and nestled in a pita covered with sauce and salad.</p>

<p>3. Avoid driving. The traffic jams and narrow streets in Jerusalem are a challenge, as they are in Tel Aviv. If possible, use Jerusalem’s light rail or extensive bus system. Trains run between major cities. Road signage is in Hebrew, with only a percentage including English translations.</p>

<ol>
<li><p>Know the exchange rate. When I was there the rate is was roughly 4 shekels to 1 USD (actually 3.75:1). Since most merchants will accept either currency, be wary of glib exchange quotes. I wanted to hire a taxi and my Arabic driver quoted me 60 shekels. I had been quoted 40 earlier in the day and I told him so. “Okay, for you my American friend” he said, “I’ll make it half, just 30 US dollars.” Huh??</p></li>
<li><p>Bring adapters with you. I recommend 2-3 if you’re packing lots of electronic gear. As a photographer I carry battery chargers, iPhone, laptop, and more.</p></li>
<li><p>Be open-minded. The mid-East, and Israel in particular, is in the news constantly. I saw with my own eyes that much of what we hear is distorted. Ask questions. Talk to ordinary citizens. Israel is a nation surrounded by enemies, which has served to frame its collective psyche. Try to understand their point of view. Substitute your own country for Israel, put it in Israel’s circumstances, and try to imagine what your country might do.</p></li>
</ol>

<p>In any event, here is the link to the ScotteVest winners:</p>

<p><a href="http://www.scottevest.com/company/photography.shtml">http://www.scottevest.com/company/photography.shtml</a></p>

<p>When you get to the link, you&#8217;ll see our reasons for selecting the winners. Please understand that these types of contests are entirely subjective. I wish ScotteVest had set up several different categories so that we could have named more winners and perhaps next year they will. There were many terrific images submitted.</p>

<p>On behalf of ScotteVest, thanks to all of you who participated in the contest.</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>It’s one of those experiences few travelers get to have nowadays. I was aboard an El Al flight to Israel, when suddenly a group of bearded men, all Ultra-Orthodox Jews, stood and walked to the rear of the plane. Strange, I thought, and immediately thought of the rapture. Ooops, that could never happen on El Al!.</p>

<p>We had been on the flight for nearly eight hours, and the sun was just peeking over the horizon, reluctantly lighting up the plane for we sleepy travelers. The men were congregating to perform their morning prayers. Jewish ritual requires at least ten men to be present for the service to carry even more significance in their communion with God.</p>

<p>Here is an iPhone image I took of one of the men, who apparently had overslept and was praying alone. It was extraordinary to see how easily the flight attendants accommodated the gathering, staying out of their way for the 15 minutes they required. They then quietly returned to their seats as if nothing unusual had happened.</p>

<p><a href="http://blog.lesterpickerphoto.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/03/photo1.jpg"><img class="alignnone size-medium wp-image-2023" title="photo" src="http://blog.lesterpickerphoto.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/03/photo1-e1332009191540-225x300.jpg" alt="" width="225" height="300"></a></p>

<p>Earlier in the flight, some of those same Ultra-Orthodox men walked around the plane asking male passengers if they were Jewish and, if they were, would they like to join them in putting on the Tfillin. Tfillin are a pair of ritualistic leather straps, known in English as phylacteries, that have a box attached to each set. The boxes contain hand inscribed prayers. One set is placed on the head and one on the left arm, next to the heart. These phylacteries are described in the Old Testament and are a way that pious Jews “bind” themselves to God, by wrapping the leather straps around their arm and placing the second box on their forehead, held in place by the straps. With the heart and brain now connected, the person is supposed to feel a personal connection with their Supreme Being.</p>

<p>Be that as it may, the non-Jewish passengers were alternately amused or curious regarding the ritual and lively discussions broke out throughout the plane, or at least in the cattle section, which is where I was stanchioned. Groups of men and women watched as the Rabbis helped the Jewish volunteers with the ritual. Imagine that happening on a Southwest Airlines flight between Dallas and Little Rock!</p>

<p>Only one thing could possibly have interrupted such an essential spiritual act. DINNER! Jews, like Italians, ascribe to eating certain spiritual dimensions that trump virtually any God-given commandment including, apparently, Thou Shalt Not Kill. I know this because many were the times I heard my Aunts and Uncles say to me: “Oy, I’d kill for a piece of your mother’s gefilte fish!” Which is also probably why I never ate gefilte fish in front of my relatives.</p>

<p>Anyway, with the announcement that dinner was about to be served, Tfillin were hurriedly packed into their embroidered pouches and the Rabbis led the charge back to our respective six inches of real estate.</p>

<p>Which brings me to my final point in all this, that being that if cattle were actually packed into spaces that were proportionally as tight as El-Al’s economy seats, how long do you think it would be before the ASPCA, ACLU, PETA, ADA, and every other dyed-in-the-wool (make that non-toxic dye, of course… kosher, too) animal loving organization sued for inhumane treatment?</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>I could really use some help here. Bob (my assistant) and I recently decided to buy a new printer to support our ever growing fine art print business. We need to be able to produce very large prints, so we&#8217;re opting for a printer that can produce 44&#8221; prints.</p>

<p>We&#8217;ve narrowed the field to the Canon ipf 8300 and the Epson 9900, both seemingly very capable machines.</p>

<p><a href="http://blog.lesterpickerphoto.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/03/images1.jpeg"><img class="size-full wp-image-2016" title="images" src="http://blog.lesterpickerphoto.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/03/images1.jpeg" alt="" width="282" height="178"></a></p>

<p>However, this is a scary move for me. First, these machines are monsters, weighing around 400 lbs and occupying lots of real estate. They are costly to buy and I don&#8217;t even want to think about paper and ink costs!</p>

<p>I&#8217;d love to know if any of you have either of these printers and, if so, what you think of them. Please give me nuts and bolts. What do you love and hate about them? How expensive are they to upkeep? Did you buy the extended warranty? What do you think of the print quality? Any tips, tricks or suggestions? Any comments would be greatly appreciated.</p>

<p>Thanks. I look forward to hearing from you. I&#8217;ll certainly keep you posted as I go through this process.</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p><a href="http://blog.lesterpickerphoto.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/03/images.jpeg"><img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-2009" title="images" src="http://blog.lesterpickerphoto.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/03/images.jpeg" alt="" width="254" height="199"></a></p>

<p>In a few days I&#8217;m bound for Israel, spending ten days on a tour, which is kind of a first for me. Frankly, I&#8217;m not the tour group type. Not that there is anything wrong with tours. It&#8217;s just that people tend to take a distinct dislike to me when I&#8217;m just setting up my tripod and camera for a shot while they&#8217;re already piling back on the bus to move to the next spot. The frustration on both sides after only a couple of days is almost electric.</p>

<p>That&#8217;s the big problem with tours for me. Being a photographer I like to spend as much time as I like in interesting places and no time in places I consider photographically less than interesting (to me). However, I promised my wife that I would be good, and I plan to stick by that.</p>

<p>Except&#8230;  I do plan to bring some camera gear with me (&#8220;Define &#8216;some,&#8217; honey!), mostly for market images, shots of people, as well as iconic architectural images. Since I have to be efficient and grab shots on the run, so to speak, I was wondering if you folks could help me out?</p>

<p>What images would you suggest? Any &#8220;secret&#8221; vantage points at monuments or other locales? What would you say are the &#8220;not to be missed&#8221; images?</p>

<p>Thanks in advance. I&#8217;m looking forward to your responses.</p>

<p>Les</p>

<p><strong>UPDATE</strong>:  I decided to take two camera systems with me. Don&#8217;t ask. I know I&#8217;m nuts, but what if I&#8217;m at some iconic location and the sun is setting over a perfect pastoral scene and&#8230; yadda yadda. I&#8217;m hoping to get at least a few good keepers, so I figure it&#8217;s worth shlepping my Hassy and Nikon systems, just in case. Just wish me luck getting through El Al airline security!</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>I am just so excited to announce that I was awarded First Place for Photography in Canada&#8217;s Northern Lights Award for travel journalism.</p>

<p><a href="http://blog.lesterpickerphoto.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/03/timthumb.php_.jpeg"><img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-2003" title="timthumb.php" src="http://blog.lesterpickerphoto.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/03/timthumb.php_.jpeg" alt="" width="120" height="120"></a></p>

<p>I&#8217;ll have more to say about the award in a blog next week, after I speak with the organizers. I was just informed today via phone tag and email. The award will be presented at a ceremony in April in San Francisco. For now, I can only thank the tourism folks in Canada, who have been so helpful to me whenever I cross the border to photograph and write about their spectacular country and wonderful people.</p>

<p>The winning photograph(s) were taken in Yukon Territory and for that I especially thank the Yukon Tourism folks and Jim Kemshead, in particular. Great bunch of folks fortunate enough to live in one of the last unspoiled wildernesses in North America.</p>

<p>More later&#8230;</p>
