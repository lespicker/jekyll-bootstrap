  <div class="entry-content"><p>There is a village in this small corner of Vanuatu, where several years ago a group of indigenous people came together to discuss a plague that threatened to destroy them. Their children were being abducted by corporate marketers hawking products irrelevant to their preferred way of life. Their people were abandoning centuries old values, ones that uniquely defined them. In short, they were in danger of losing their culture, yet another victim of the relentless spread of western consumerism.</p>

<p>They talked, they debated and they listened as a community, and in the end they made a daring decision. They would abandon the trappings of modern society and embrace the ways of old. They formed Ekasup Village, just outside of Port Vila.</p>

<p><a href="http://blog.lesterpickerphoto.com/wp-content/uploads/2010/11/Ekasup-Village-Port-Vila-Fiji-1002010-11-04.jpg"><img class="size-medium wp-image-749" title="Ekasup Village, Port Vila, Fiji 1002010-11-04" src="http://blog.lesterpickerphoto.com/wp-content/uploads/2010/11/Ekasup-Village-Port-Vila-Fiji-1002010-11-04-200x300.jpg" alt="" width="200" height="300"></a></p>

<h3><strong><em>Ekasup Village As a Tourist Venue</em></strong></h3>


<p>It’s hard to describe Ekasup Village. On its face, it is an educational facility designed to give tourists a real taste of traditional island life, prior to Western influences. To that end they do a marvelous job.</p>

<p>Each small group of tourists are greeted by a professional guide who is a village resident. They are then led through parts of the village, where residents dressed in traditional garb demonstrate various crafts and natural medicines and staple foods. There is also a singing and dancing demonstration at the outdoor community meeting spot, a semi-circular lava stone, open air facility painstakingly built by the residents.</p>

<p>The nominal cost of the tour, $20 USD, is worth every penny as everyone who I spoke to attested. Children enjoyed the dancing, singing, demonstrations and samples of traditional foods.</p>

<h3><strong><em>The &#8216;Real&#8217; Ekasup Village</em></strong></h3>


<p>But Ekasup Village is far more than its face. Behind the very effective attempt to educate, there exists the reality of village life. Ekasup is actually home to approximately 60 families comprising 500 individuals. Started in 1996, the village was completed in 2001, although improvements continue. Residents agree to live as did their ancestors. There are no watches, telephones, radios, televisions or other electronics in the village.</p>

<p>The village has its own school and the villagers own the land which traverses Erakor rain forest and winds down a hillside to the shore.</p>

<p><a href="http://blog.lesterpickerphoto.com/wp-content/uploads/2010/11/Ekasup-Village-Port-Vila-Fiji-712010-11-04.jpg"><img class="size-medium wp-image-750" title="Ekasup Village, Port Vila, Fiji 712010-11-04" src="http://blog.lesterpickerphoto.com/wp-content/uploads/2010/11/Ekasup-Village-Port-Vila-Fiji-712010-11-04-199x300.jpg" alt="" width="199" height="300"></a></p>

<p>Sifo, the adult son of the tribal chief, served as my guide and admirably tolerated my incessant questions. At one point he introduced us to his youngest son, who is learning the traditional ways from his father and the village elders.</p>

<p><a href="http://blog.lesterpickerphoto.com/wp-content/uploads/2010/11/Ekasup-Village-Port-Vila-Fiji-972010-11-04.jpg"><img class="size-medium wp-image-751" title="Ekasup Village, Port Vila, Fiji 972010-11-04" src="http://blog.lesterpickerphoto.com/wp-content/uploads/2010/11/Ekasup-Village-Port-Vila-Fiji-972010-11-04-200x300.jpg" alt="" width="200" height="300"></a></p>

<p>The village includes a magnificent ficus tree, used by the ancient villagers as a shelter from monsoons.</p>

<p><a href="http://blog.lesterpickerphoto.com/wp-content/uploads/2010/11/Ekasup-Village-Port-Vila-Fiji-332010-11-04.jpg"><img class="size-medium wp-image-752" title="Ekasup Village, Port Vila, Fiji 332010-11-04" src="http://blog.lesterpickerphoto.com/wp-content/uploads/2010/11/Ekasup-Village-Port-Vila-Fiji-332010-11-04-200x300.jpg" alt="" width="200" height="300"></a></p>

<p>When they are not educating tourists about their culture, the residents are free to do as they like. Some fish, others tend gardens, and just about everyone naps during rainy weather in the off-season. The spiritual practices of residents runs the gamut from plain vanilla Christianity to traditional animist practices.</p>

<p><a href="http://blog.lesterpickerphoto.com/wp-content/uploads/2010/11/Ekasup-Village-Port-Vila-Fiji-232010-11-04.jpg"><img class="size-medium wp-image-753 " title="Ekasup Village, Port Vila, Fiji 232010-11-04" src="http://blog.lesterpickerphoto.com/wp-content/uploads/2010/11/Ekasup-Village-Port-Vila-Fiji-232010-11-04-200x300.jpg" alt="" width="200" height="300"></a></p>

<h3><strong><em>A Special Gift</em></strong></h3>


<p>An interesting side note is that my wife and I were abandoned by our taxi driver, who dropped us off at the village and then disappeared. As a result we had to spend extra time at the village, one of those true gifts that happens when you are flexible enough to go with the flow. The extra time we had allowed us to learn more about this tribal culture and to enjoy the company of our the village residents. One of the more interesting cultural practices involves the use of chicken feathers in the headdress of the men. The feathers represent the colors of their pigs and the more ornate the feathering, the more impressive their pig holdings. This serves to advertise the status of the single males during tribal gatherings, when eligible women will be present.</p>

<p>If your travel plans include Vanuatu, be sure to carve out time for this excellent educational experience.</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>Since I&#8217;ve been a child, I imagined being in New Zealand. When I watched Peter Jackson&#8217;s Lord of the Rings, spellbound, the child within was awakened. And so, here I am. No book, no documentary, indeed not even The Lord of the Rings, could have prepared me for the reality of New Zealand. It is stunning, the penultimate eye candy, an unending visual spectacle that boggles the mind.</p>

<h3><strong>From Christchurch to Fiordland</strong></h3>


<p>We left Christchurch (see <a href="http://blog.lesterpickerphoto.com/2010/11/20/alive-and-well-in-christchurch/">http://blog.lesterpickerphoto.com/2010/11/20/alive-and-well-in-christchurch/</a>) heading toward Fiordland National Park, on a mission to scout out the South Island for our long-term return visit in 2012-13. Heading southwest,  we travelled through a rich, green tapestry of agricultural fields. The landscape changes gradually from totally flat to hilly, with tens of thousands of sheep grazing contentedly, forming a picturesque pastoral scene. (Factoid: NZ has 40 million sheep, or ten sheep for every resident.)</p>

<p><a href="http://blog.lesterpickerphoto.com/wp-content/uploads/2010/11/South-Island-New-Zealand-112010-11-19.jpg"><img class="size-medium wp-image-740" title="South Island, New Zealand 112010-11-19" src="http://blog.lesterpickerphoto.com/wp-content/uploads/2010/11/South-Island-New-Zealand-112010-11-19-300x199.jpg" alt="" width="300" height="199"></a></p>

<p>New Zealanders, surprisingly to me,  also raise enormous numbers of deer for the world venison market.</p>

<p><a href="http://blog.lesterpickerphoto.com/wp-content/uploads/2010/11/New-Zealand-road-to-Te-Anau-342010-11-14.jpg"><img class="size-medium wp-image-741" title="New Zealand, road to Te Anau 342010-11-14" src="http://blog.lesterpickerphoto.com/wp-content/uploads/2010/11/New-Zealand-road-to-Te-Anau-342010-11-14-300x200.jpg" alt="" width="300" height="200"></a></p>

<h3><strong>Lake Tekapo</strong></h3>


<p>We were headed seven hours away, for Lake Tekapo (pronounced tee&#8217;-kah-poe) where I intended to become the umpteen millionth photographer to capture the Church of the Good Shepard, which is perched on a small rise along the shore of the Lake, encircled by a chain of snow-capped mountains in the distance.</p>

<p>As Robert Burns said; &#8220;The best laid schemes o&#8217; mice and men, gang aft agley.&#8221; I set up my tripod and camera well before sunset and promptly faced gale-force winds and light drizzle. Photographers can take, and may even welcome, a gentle rain, but wind is our enemy in most cases (unless you&#8217;re Darwin Wiggett, a photographer I greatly admire&#8230; see my links for his website).</p>

<p>I had a mental image of the shots I had wanted to take, but after a couple of hours on site, I came away disappointed, but knowing for sure how I want to shoot the scene in a couple of years, weather permitting. I&#8217;ll plan to spend a few days in the area to increase my chances of better weather.</p>

<p><a href="http://blog.lesterpickerphoto.com/wp-content/uploads/2010/11/Tekapo-New-Zealand-442010-11-13.jpg"><img class="size-medium wp-image-742" title="Tekapo, New Zealand 442010-11-13" src="http://blog.lesterpickerphoto.com/wp-content/uploads/2010/11/Tekapo-New-Zealand-442010-11-13-300x199.jpg" alt="" width="300" height="199"></a></p>

<p>After a rainy night in Lake Tekapo, we left for Te Anau, the staging town for entry into the wild, undeveloped Fiordland National park. Here lie the iconic NZ landscapes: Milford Sound, Doubtful Sound and the dozens of other coastal sounds that have kept maritime explorers and present-day hikers busy investigating their mysterious beauty for hundreds of years.</p>

<h3><strong>A Lovely Inn in a Wonderful Town</strong></h3>


<p>Te Anau is a lovely small town, situated as it is along the southeast shore of picturesque Lake Te Anau.   On a whim I had booked us into Dock Bay Lodge, a relatively new property purpose-built as an inn by its owners, Dawn and Mark Dowling. This was only the second instance on our month-long adventure in Australia, New Zealand, Fiji and New Caledonia where the reality of our lodging far surpassed our expectations, a rarity as any travel writer will tell you.</p>

<p><a href="http://blog.lesterpickerphoto.com/wp-content/uploads/2010/11/Te-Anau-New-Zealand-Dock-Bay-Lodge-22010-11-14.jpg"><img class="size-medium wp-image-743" title="Te Anau, New Zealand- Dock Bay Lodge 22010-11-14" src="http://blog.lesterpickerphoto.com/wp-content/uploads/2010/11/Te-Anau-New-Zealand-Dock-Bay-Lodge-22010-11-14-300x199.jpg" alt="" width="300" height="199"></a></p>

<p>Dock Bay Lodge (<a href="http://">www.dockbaylodge.co.nz</a>) overlooks Lake Te Anau on an immaculately landscaped property. The bedrooms are huge, and the ceramic tiled bathrooms modern and roomy. The communal living room sported a digital wide-screen television, a large fireplace and large, comfortable leather couches.</p>

<p>The dining room has a large table, able to accommodate the maximum of 10 guests, with floor to ceiling sliding window-doors that give a 210 degree view of the Te Anau environs.</p>

<p>But, it is what is served in this dining area that is a good indication of just how special Dock Bay is. Breakfasts include a selection of juices, yogurt, cereals- including Dawn&#8217;s special recipe muesli- and fresh fruits. There is also a selection of croissants and breads, served with your choice of specialty jams. Dawn and her assistant, Diane, will prepare a hot breakfast of eggs with all †he trimmings and porridge (what Americans call cooked oatmeal).</p>

<p>Dawn and Mark are highly involved in the workings of the town and in the tourism industry. Several times during our 3-night stay I relied on her unfailing advice on what to see and do.</p>

<p>Once you check in to Dock Bay, everything is included. Your in-room refrigerator is stocked with NZ wines and beers, as well as other refreshments. Cookies are provided daily by Diane. Dawn will send you on your way with a cup of coffee or tea. Throughout the lodge Dawn&#8217;s taste is evident. The lodge is decorated so tastefully, my wife and I found ourselves just walking about admiring the artwork and furnishings.</p>

<p>Dawn and Mark are warm, welcoming and gracious hosts, so if you find yourself planning a Kiwi visit, you might want to try Dock Bay Lodge. If you do, be sure to let us know via this blog how your experience went.</p>

<p>In my next blog I’ll cover what there is to do and see in Te Anau, and Milford Doubtful Sounds.</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>Once in a while I’m blessed with a wonderful surprise as a travel photojournalist. I get to visit a place for which I had no expectations, but which brings forth hidden jewels. That was the case when I visited Lifou, one of the Loyalty Islands in the archipelago of New Caledonia.</p>

<h3>New Caledonia: A New Future</h3>


<p>New Caledonia is currently a French protectorate, but is slated for a vote on independence in 2014. Recognizing that its future economy will, in large part, depend on tourism, the island group is busily preparing. Even tiny Lifou Island appears to be raising its profile. It recently hosted a first-ever visit from Royal Caribbean’s Rhapsody of the Seas, a 2,000-passenger vessel out of Sydney, Australia. I was lecturing aboard on digital photography.</p>

<p>Disgorging two thousand people onto an island that does not even have a docking facility (passengers had to be tendered in) is no small task. And, to be sure the islanders were overwhelmed. Yet one would be hard pressed to find more friendly people, willing to accommodate tourists in whatever way they can. The indigenous people greeted us with a colorful and melodic singing and dancing troupe, using hand-pads made of coconut hemp to produce percussion sounds.</p>

<p><a href="http://blog.lesterpickerphoto.com/wp-content/uploads/2010/11/Lifou-New-Caledonia-122010-11-05.jpg"><img class="size-medium wp-image-723" title="Lifou, New Caledonia 122010-11-05" src="http://blog.lesterpickerphoto.com/wp-content/uploads/2010/11/Lifou-New-Caledonia-122010-11-05-200x300.jpg" alt="" width="200" height="300"></a></p>

<p>First a bit of geography. Lifou is a classic tropical island, with miles and miles of pure white sand beaches. Its reefs are idyllic. Fish are abundant. The tropical huts that its indigenous people live in are picturesque and inviting.</p>

<p><a href="http://blog.lesterpickerphoto.com/wp-content/uploads/2010/11/Lifou-New-Caledonia-602010-11-05.jpg"><img class="size-medium wp-image-725" title="Lifou, New Caledonia 602010-11-05" src="http://blog.lesterpickerphoto.com/wp-content/uploads/2010/11/Lifou-New-Caledonia-602010-11-05-199x300.jpg" alt="" width="199" height="300"></a></p>

<p>Lifou also sports caves, picturesque cliffs and gorgeous coves. I spent a lovely few hours prowling the coastline and photographing, although the day was overcast.</p>

<p><a href="http://blog.lesterpickerphoto.com/wp-content/uploads/2010/11/Lifou-New-Caledonia-1152010-11-05.jpg"><img class="size-medium wp-image-724" title="Lifou, New Caledonia 1152010-11-05" src="http://blog.lesterpickerphoto.com/wp-content/uploads/2010/11/Lifou-New-Caledonia-1152010-11-05-199x300.jpg" alt="" width="199" height="300"></a></p>

<h3>The Vanilla Farm Experience</h3>


<p>My wife and I were about to hike the mile back to the ship, when a battered red pickup truck turned into the gravel road we were walking. A man was driving, his wife next to him and two adorable children in the back. We waved hello and they stopped and tried talking to us. Our French is nonexistent, as was their English, yet we were able to communicate. That’s probably one of my favorite activities when I travel; trying to form a human-to-human bond despite the chasm of culture and language. In this case we succeeded and Jacob managed to convey to us an invitation to visit his vanilla bean farm, mostly through his ten-year old son who knew a few English words and expressions. The farm was only a hundred yards down the road.</p>

<p>And what a time we had! For the next hour, Jacob, his wife/partner Leila and their two children, Lorenzo and Maria gave us a tour of their farm, known as The Vanilleraie. Jacob and his family were filled with pride as they showed us how vanilla beans are grown.</p>

<p><a href="http://blog.lesterpickerphoto.com/wp-content/uploads/2010/11/Lifou-New-Caledonia-1382010-11-05.jpg"><img class="size-medium wp-image-726 " title="Lifou, New Caledonia 1382010-11-05" src="http://blog.lesterpickerphoto.com/wp-content/uploads/2010/11/Lifou-New-Caledonia-1382010-11-05-300x199.jpg" alt="" width="300" height="199"></a></p>

<p>The care they take with their plants is evident. Every plant is carefully manicured and cultivated. Each plant is mulched with coconut shells, since the coconut palm grows wild throughout the island and on Jacob’s and Leila’s property. So nothing is wasted, Jacob and his son feed the coconut meat to their pigs.</p>

<p>It was hot and steamy out, but that was the last thing on our minds as we admired the farm they had carved out of the tropical jungle. At the end of the visit Jacob opened a weather-beaten suitcase and showed us the crown jewel of his operation; probably several hundred now dried and brown vanilla beans. My, god, what an intoxicating smell wafted to us when he opened that suitcase! He offered us some as a gift, but we tried to explain to him that we were not allowed to take any plants or foods back to the ship. He looked disappointed- and probably thought we were nuts- but I hope he understood. As soon as I get back to the States, I’ll send photos of the family back to them.</p>

<p><a href="http://blog.lesterpickerphoto.com/wp-content/uploads/2010/11/Lifou-New-Caledonia-1912010-11-05.jpg"><img class="size-medium wp-image-727   " title="Lifou, New Caledonia 1912010-11-05" src="http://blog.lesterpickerphoto.com/wp-content/uploads/2010/11/Lifou-New-Caledonia-1912010-11-05-200x300.jpg" alt="" width="130" height="194"></a></p>

<p>If you ever do get to Lifou, make The Vanilleraie a must-see stop, especially if you speak French.</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><h3>What Earthquake?</h3>


<p>New Zealand is subject to earthquakes&#8230; lots of them. But after the recent earthquake tragedy in Christchurch, New Zealand, I’m convinced that the media whipped it into a distorted frenzy. Yes, one person died several days later of a heart attack. But the devastation I witnessed while here is nowhere near as bad as I had imagined.</p>

<p><a href="http://blog.lesterpickerphoto.com/wp-content/uploads/2010/11/Christchurch-South-Island-New-Zealand-852010-11-20.jpg"><img class="size-medium wp-image-711" title="Christchurch, South Island, New Zealand 852010-11-20" src="http://blog.lesterpickerphoto.com/wp-content/uploads/2010/11/Christchurch-South-Island-New-Zealand-852010-11-20-300x199.jpg" alt="" width="300" height="199"></a></p>

<p>To be sure, there are buildings down and repair work going on in the downtown business areas. There are regular aftershocks, and we felt a slight tremor at 10:30 at night on our second night in the city (only a 3.5 on the Richter scale, thankfully). But on the whole Christchurch is alive and vibrant, with a marvelous restaurant scene and arts venues citywide.</p>

<p>First a couple of our favorites to place in your file for future reference. I won’t get into lots of detail here (I’ll save that for my magazine writing&#8230; which reminds me&#8230; that’s another reason to register on this site&#8230; I’ll let you know whenever my writing appears in print). As is true virtually everywhere in NZ, prices are generally high. But we did find some exceptional values and fun activities. I also wanted to share a photo insight with you.</p>

<h3>Some Exciting Eateries</h3>


<p>If you are staying anywhere near the city center, do consider a walk to the Addington section on Lincoln Road and spend an pleasurable breakfast hour at the Addington Coffee Co-op, where you’ll enjoy organic, fair-traded coffee, loose-leaf teas, and scrumptious breakfast offerings. I had an amazing smoked salmon and cream cheese rolled in an egg omelette, with a side fresh fruit salad. My wife feasted on a dark raisin bread with other dried fruits in it, along with ricotta cheese and jam spread. She was in heaven. The ambience is of an old coffee house, like Starbucks before it became the corporate STARBUCKS. The tab was $25.30 NZ dollars, but discount that by around 25% for the favorable exchange rate.</p>

<p>For lunches and dinners, there is a wide variety of options in Christchurch, encompassing every ethnic food imaginable. We tried a very plain looking Chinese restaurant called Sampan, on the corner of Columbo and Tuam Roads. This family-run restaurant surprised us with generous plates of seafood and fresh vegetables, rice and mini spring rolls. Total tab was $20 NZ dollars, although we actually split the dish because the portions were so large.</p>

<h3>The Christchurch Arts Scene</h3>


<p>The arts scene appears quite vibrant all over NZ, but especially in Oamaru ( a small town south of Christchurch) and in Christchurch itself. We had a lovely time in Christchurch at The Arts Centre, a repurposed church building that houses dozens of arts and crafts shops, including several that offer original Maori art. There is a fine cafe located on the second floor with nice views of the tree-lined area.</p>

<p><a href="http://blog.lesterpickerphoto.com/wp-content/uploads/2010/11/Christchurch-South-Island-New-Zealand-992010-11-20.jpg"><img class="aligncenter size-medium wp-image-713" title="Christchurch, South Island, New Zealand 992010-11-20" src="http://blog.lesterpickerphoto.com/wp-content/uploads/2010/11/Christchurch-South-Island-New-Zealand-992010-11-20-300x199.jpg" alt="" width="300" height="199"></a></p>

<p>Diagonally across the street from The Arts Centre is the Christchurch Art Gallery, a light-filled art museum offering an eclectic mix of artists and styles. We felt very fortunate to have Ron Mueck’s art on display as a major exhibit. His work has drawn major attention and kudos in the art world. Perhaps you’ve seen his larger than life size sculptures that look so real you’d swear the sculpture will get up to shift positions in just a moment. While admission to the museum is free, the Mueck exhibit was $15.00 per adult extra, and worth every penny.</p>

<p><a href="http://blog.lesterpickerphoto.com/wp-content/uploads/2010/11/Christchurch-South-Island-New-Zealand-1182010-11-20.jpg"><img class="size-medium wp-image-714" title="Christchurch, South Island, New Zealand 1182010-11-20" src="http://blog.lesterpickerphoto.com/wp-content/uploads/2010/11/Christchurch-South-Island-New-Zealand-1182010-11-20-199x300.jpg" alt="" width="199" height="300"></a></p>

<p>The center city is also packed with excellent shopping that includes a nice outdoor walking mall, as well as boutique clothing stores. At the west end of the walking mall is the Botanic Garden with the Avon River, and many young lovers, gently flowing through it.</p>

<p><a href="http://blog.lesterpickerphoto.com/wp-content/uploads/2010/11/Christchurch-South-Island-New-Zealand-252010-11-20.jpg"><img class="size-medium wp-image-715" title="Christchurch, South Island, New Zealand 252010-11-20" src="http://blog.lesterpickerphoto.com/wp-content/uploads/2010/11/Christchurch-South-Island-New-Zealand-252010-11-20-300x200.jpg" alt="" width="300" height="200"></a></p>

<h3>An Important Photography Lesson</h3>


<p>Now for the photo lesson. The weather in Christchurch when we were there was drizzly, with gray, featureless skies, in short a photographer’s nightmare. Rain is okay. Dark, angry clouds are even better. But gray skies are yucky and can turn a good image into pablum faster than you can squeeze the shutter. So what’s a photographer to do?</p>

<p><a href="http://blog.lesterpickerphoto.com/wp-content/uploads/2010/11/Christchurch-South-Island-New-Zealand-502010-11-20.jpg"><img class="size-medium wp-image-716" title="Christchurch, South Island, New Zealand 502010-11-20" src="http://blog.lesterpickerphoto.com/wp-content/uploads/2010/11/Christchurch-South-Island-New-Zealand-502010-11-20-200x300.jpg" alt="" width="200" height="300"></a></p>

<p>I am already working on a blog that will explain this in depth, but for now suffice it to say that you need to instead focus on tight scenes which do not include the sky. We call these extraction shots, because you are extracting one element to emphasize from a more detailed scene. It limits your photography in some ways, but opens infinite creative possibilities in other ways. Look for my upcoming blog on the topic and then try it out yourself.</p>

<p><a href="http://blog.lesterpickerphoto.com/wp-content/uploads/2010/11/Christchurch-South-Island-New-Zealand-652010-11-20.jpg"><img class="size-medium wp-image-717" title="Christchurch, South Island, New Zealand 652010-11-20" src="http://blog.lesterpickerphoto.com/wp-content/uploads/2010/11/Christchurch-South-Island-New-Zealand-652010-11-20-199x300.jpg" alt="" width="199" height="300"></a></p>

<p><a href="http://blog.lesterpickerphoto.com/wp-content/uploads/2010/11/Christchurch-South-Island-New-Zealand-782010-11-20.jpg"><img class="size-medium wp-image-718" title="Christchurch, South Island, New Zealand 782010-11-20" src="http://blog.lesterpickerphoto.com/wp-content/uploads/2010/11/Christchurch-South-Island-New-Zealand-782010-11-20-199x300.jpg" alt="" width="199" height="300"></a></p>

<p>NZ is far, far more than just the city of Christchurch, as we found out on my photo tour. Look for my next NZ adventures in future blogs. Until then, happy shooting!</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><h3>The Great Ocean Walk</h3>


<p><strong>S</strong>ure, you may have heard of Australia’s Great Ocean Drive (if you haven’t, please see my previous blog: <a href="http://">http://blog.lesterpickerphoto.com/2010/11/12/the-great-ocean-drive-photo-valhalla/</a>), but have you heard of its Great Ocean Walk? Every so often I come up with a travel venue that I just love and want to share with my readers. This is one of them.</p>

<p><a href="http://blog.lesterpickerphoto.com/wp-content/uploads/2010/11/Great-Ocean-Road-Victoria-Australia-902010-11-09.jpg"><img class="size-medium wp-image-704" title="Great Ocean Road, Victoria, Australia 902010-11-09" src="http://blog.lesterpickerphoto.com/wp-content/uploads/2010/11/Great-Ocean-Road-Victoria-Australia-902010-11-09-300x199.jpg" alt="" width="300" height="199"></a></p>

<p>Various Aussie government agencies, nonprofit organizations and private landowners have created a fascinating, seven-day walk along the Pacific Ocean that meanders through scenery that defies description; along seaside cliffs, through cow pastures and verdant forests. The walk can be done in one weeklong trek, or in one-day or multi-day segments, conveniently divided so that you can pick up those sections you missed at a future time. Along the way are campgrounds and inns that cater to the walking crowd. The walks range from easy to moderately strenuous, depending on your age, physical condition and pace.</p>

<p><a href="http://blog.lesterpickerphoto.com/wp-content/uploads/2010/11/Bothfeet-Lodge-Victoria-Australia-92010-11-10.jpg"><img class="aligncenter size-medium wp-image-700" title="Bothfeet Lodge, Victoria, Australia 92010-11-10" src="http://blog.lesterpickerphoto.com/wp-content/uploads/2010/11/Bothfeet-Lodge-Victoria-Australia-92010-11-10-300x199.jpg" alt="" width="300" height="199"></a></p>

<h3>Using BothFeet</h3>


<p>My wife and I joined one of these walks conducted by a creative small business called Bothfeet, a dream of owners Gavin and Dana Ronan, themselves avid walkers. Bothfeet’s concept is unique in that they run an elegant lodge that caters to every whim of walkers. They offer several types of walking experiences. You can go on a guided walk for any length of days or hire one their very able guides for your private party. Or, you can just stay at the Bothfeet Lodge and take walks on your own. They will pick you up at the end of each day’s segment.</p>

<p><a href="http://blog.lesterpickerphoto.com/wp-content/uploads/2010/11/Great-Ocean-Road-Victoria-Australia-602010-11-09.jpg"><img class="size-medium wp-image-701" title="Great Ocean Road, Victoria, Australia 602010-11-09" src="http://blog.lesterpickerphoto.com/wp-content/uploads/2010/11/Great-Ocean-Road-Victoria-Australia-602010-11-09-199x300.jpg" alt="" width="199" height="300"></a></p>

<p>Waiting for you when you get back to the lodge are heated footbaths with organic salts, an indulgent and delightful experience after a good day’s walk. Best of all, while at Bothfeet you get to feast on the healthy snacks and gourmet meals of Ha Nguyen, their creative, very personable and energetic chef (and site manager).   Bothfeet (www.bothfeet.com.au/) provides all sorts of accessories for walkers to use while at the lodge, all included in the price. Need raingear? No problem. Mosquito nets, sunscreen, backpacks? All included. They also provide gators for your feet and ankles to prevent potential snakebites, which are quite rare. But, then again, Australia has more venomous than non-venomous snakes, so an ounce of prevention…</p>

<h3>From the Ground Up</h3>


<p>The entire Bothfeet facility was conceived by 38-year old Gavin and designed by an architect using eco-friendly materials and concepts. Bothfeet is presently set up for ten guests, creating a wonderfully intimate atmosphere. Future plans include expanding to accommodate a maximum of 20 visitors. The buildings are all modular and nicely appointed, with wood walkways linking all facilities.</p>

<p><a href="http://blog.lesterpickerphoto.com/wp-content/uploads/2010/11/Great-Ocean-Road-Victoria-Australia-722010-11-09.jpg"><img class="size-medium wp-image-703" title="Great Ocean Road, Victoria, Australia 722010-11-09" src="http://blog.lesterpickerphoto.com/wp-content/uploads/2010/11/Great-Ocean-Road-Victoria-Australia-722010-11-09-199x300.jpg" alt="" width="199" height="300"></a></p>

<p>On our first afternoon at Bothfeet, we walked along highlands that paralleled a picturesque stretch of the ocean, from Aire River Valley to Johanna Beach, a distance of perhaps 7 kilometers. Our knowledgeable guide, Marie Killeen, pointed out items of interest, from Aboriginal medicinal plants to the story of shipwrecks that occurred just offshore from where our feet were planted. Walkers encounter some of Australia’s iconic wildlife, like kangaroos, wallabies and koalas, with Marie providing a naturalist’s commentary. Luscious and nutritious lunches are prepared and packed by Ha and happily consumed by hungry walkers.</p>

<p><a href="http://blog.lesterpickerphoto.com/wp-content/uploads/2010/11/Great-Ocean-Road-Victoria-Australia-382010-11-09.jpg"><img class="size-medium wp-image-702" title="Great Ocean Road, Victoria, Australia 382010-11-09" src="http://blog.lesterpickerphoto.com/wp-content/uploads/2010/11/Great-Ocean-Road-Victoria-Australia-382010-11-09-199x300.jpg" alt="" width="199" height="300"></a></p>

<p>If you are interested in an active vacation and want an incredible walking-lodging experience I heartily recommend a stay at Bothfeet. If you do, please come back here to share your experiences with our blog readers.</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><h3>The Great Ocean Drive</h3>


<p>There are just a handful of iconic scenic drives in this world. One, of course, is Highway 1 along California’s northern coast. Others include Ocean Drive in Acadia National Park, and the spectacular Road to Hana on the island of Maui.  Add to that Australia’s Great Ocean Road, a jaw-dropping drive starting southwest of Melbourne and continuing west to Port Campbell and beyond.</p>

<p>As part of my current photo adventure (future photo travel workshop anyone?), I got to spend several days along Australia’s Great Ocean Road. It’s a marvel of engineering, with backdrop courtesy of Mother Nature.</p>

<p><a href="http://blog.lesterpickerphoto.com/wp-content/uploads/2010/11/Great-Ocean-Road-Victoria-Australia-2402010-11-11.jpg"><img class="size-medium wp-image-692" title="Great Ocean Road, Victoria, Australia 2402010-11-11" src="http://blog.lesterpickerphoto.com/wp-content/uploads/2010/11/Great-Ocean-Road-Victoria-Australia-2402010-11-11-200x300.jpg" alt="" width="200" height="300"></a></p>

<p>The Great Ocean Road is easy to access from Melbourne. It’s a smooth highway jaunt (except for rush hours) along the west side of Melbourne with possibilities of joining the road at its far eastern section or at the more popular slightly more western start. Remember that everything is marked in kilometers, one of which is 6/10 of a mile, so the distance is not as far as it first appears. BTW, the Aussies drive on the left, so if you drive please do so leisurely until you’re acclimated.   Actually, you’d have to drive leisurely.</p>

<h3>Unparalleled Views</h3>


<p>The scenery as you traverse this coast is jaw dropping. Fortunately, the Aussies have carved turnouts frequently along the route, so you can allow others to pass or just get out to admire the view.</p>

<p>Oh, God, what a view! The every twist and turn reveals towering cliffs beaten by ocean surf, white sand beaches that stretch for kilometers, sandstone rock formations standing by themselves in the ocean, having been carved from the mainland by the sea’s relentless wave action for eons.   If you are a photographer, you’ll need to plan your agenda carefully, or else you’ll never make it past the first 20 kilometers.</p>

<p>Along the road are photographic side trips, images of fields, sheep grazing, even rain forests with huge, tree-like primitive ferns that give you the eerie feeling of walking the earth of 300,000,000 years ago. There are also several waterfalls that offer great photo opps.</p>

<p><a href="http://blog.lesterpickerphoto.com/wp-content/uploads/2010/11/Great-Ocean-Road-Victoria-Australia-1562010-11-10.jpg"><img class="size-medium wp-image-693" title="Great Ocean Road, Victoria, Australia 1562010-11-10" src="http://blog.lesterpickerphoto.com/wp-content/uploads/2010/11/Great-Ocean-Road-Victoria-Australia-1562010-11-10-199x300.jpg" alt="" width="199" height="300"></a></p>

<h3>Critiques &amp; Comments Welcome</h3>


<p>On my agenda were certain iconic shots- the 12 Apostles, various arches and the like- but also some less frequented sites where I could play with light and water motion. I’ve included a few of those shots here, but I haven’t been able to do any post-processing since I’m on the road. But, I think you’ll get the idea. In any event, I welcome your comments and critique.</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><h3>Viti Levu</h3>


<p>Fiji is actually a tropical island archipelago consisting of more than 300 islands and 500 tiny islets. Only 110 islands are populated (by humans), but 87% of the population lives on the islands of Viti Levu and Vanua Levu, the largest in the chain.</p>

<p>And so, bound by our ship’s schedule, we stopped at the capital of Suva on the eastern side of Viti Levu for a day, followed by a one-day stop in Lautoka, on the west side of the island.</p>

<p>In one of my past blogs I talked about the limitations of cruise ship travel for serious photographers. But, since I teach photography onboard cruise ships, I have no choice of venues or layover times.</p>

<h3>Colo-I-Suva Forest</h3>


<p>To be perfectly blunt, I could do without seeing Suva again. It is an economically depressed city. However, there are some interesting natural areas on the outskirts of the city. One we visited was the Colo-I-Suva Forest Park, about 25 minutes out of town. Although not well maintained, it does offer some good hiking and photo ops. Just be sure you have a guide with you, as the area has had some robberies at the hands of locals in recent years. It is patrolled erratically by police, but I wouldn’t count on their sporadic presence. Our taxi driver, Edward, escorted us wherever we went. The trails can be very slippery and the trail railings are flimsy, so come prepared. Be sure to bring rain gear with you, too. Downpours can be sudden and severe.</p>

<h3>Photographing in Local Markets</h3>


<p>The saving graces- at least as far as photography goes- in Suva and Lautoka, are their  local produce markets. Wandering through these vibrant markets one is immediately caught up in the fragrant aromas of exotic spices and plants. Most of the vendors are hard-working Indians who have extensively migrated to Fiji and control most of the commercial scene. Unfortunately, that has produced some resentment on the part of native Fijians, which can erupt into ugly shouting matches among taxi drivers vying for business, for example.</p>

<p><a href="http://blog.lesterpickerphoto.com/wp-content/uploads/2010/11/New-Caledonia-Fiji-62010-11-02.jpg"><img class="size-medium wp-image-685" title="New Caledonia-Fiji 62010-11-02" src="http://blog.lesterpickerphoto.com/wp-content/uploads/2010/11/New-Caledonia-Fiji-62010-11-02-300x199.jpg" alt="" width="300" height="199"></a></p>

<p>That aside, the markets are a cacophony of sights and sounds. The vendors are as colorful as their wares and most are welcoming of the respectful photographer (see my blog on photographing people: <a href="http://blog.lesterpickerphoto.com/2010/02/13/photographing-people/">http://blog.lesterpickerphoto.com/2010/02/13/photographing-people/</a> ). We had a marvelous time wandering through the market, asking people about the strange produce and spices, a great way to strike up conversations and learn more about the people and local culture.</p>

<p><a href="http://blog.lesterpickerphoto.com/wp-content/uploads/2010/11/New-Caledonia-Fiji-72010-11-02.jpg"><img class="size-medium wp-image-686" title="New Caledonia-Fiji 72010-11-02" src="http://blog.lesterpickerphoto.com/wp-content/uploads/2010/11/New-Caledonia-Fiji-72010-11-02-200x300.jpg" alt="" width="200" height="300"></a></p>

<p>The weather was mercifully better in Lautoka, not unexpected since the western side of the island is less prone to wet weather. But, again, we were not able to take advantage of the natural landscape, due to the time constraints of the ship’s visit. Still, Viti Levu provided me with great opportunities to meet and photograph interesting people.</p>

<p><a href="http://blog.lesterpickerphoto.com/wp-content/uploads/2010/11/New-Caledonia-Fiji-92010-11-02.jpg"><img class="size-medium wp-image-687 " title="New Caledonia-Fiji 92010-11-02" src="http://blog.lesterpickerphoto.com/wp-content/uploads/2010/11/New-Caledonia-Fiji-92010-11-02-200x300.jpg" alt="" width="200" height="300"></a></p>

<p>Outside the port cities, Fiji is blessed with such an abundance of beaches and dive sites, you’d need a guidebook devoted just to that (there are such books, BTW). So, if you are a beach person, this is paradise. All of the high-end resorts boast a private beach with every water activity you could imagine, and some which you may not have known existed.</p>

<p>I’m looking forward to returning on our own, so we can become familiar with the surrounding photo ops and take advantage of them on <em>our</em> schedule.</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>Sydney is a walker’s city, so I’m hard pressed make a recommendation for where to stay. Anyplace you choose, within your budget, of course, would be fine as far as location goes. I highly recommend the Four Points Sheraton, located smack-dab on the shore of Darling Harbour, and linked to it by walkway. The Ibis Hotel is another great facility, located a few blocks further within the city, next to the theater district.</p>

<p><a href="http://blog.lesterpickerphoto.com/wp-content/uploads/2010/11/Sydney-3092010-10-26.jpg"><img class="size-medium wp-image-674" title="Sydney 3092010-10-26" src="http://blog.lesterpickerphoto.com/wp-content/uploads/2010/11/Sydney-3092010-10-26-300x199.jpg" alt="" width="300" height="199"></a></p>

<p>The centerpiece on this end of the city⎯ and there are centerpieces throughout Sydney⎯ is Darling Harbour. It’s hard to describe this venue, except to say that it is the epitome of mixed-use waterfront development. Darling Harbour is a beehive of activity. Here you’ll see people walking, biking, eating, smooching, and just plain touring. A monorail system seamlessly winds its way through the waterfront. In short, it is a photographer’s paradise.</p>

<p><a href="http://blog.lesterpickerphoto.com/wp-content/uploads/2010/11/Sydney-3172010-10-26.jpg"><img class="size-medium wp-image-676" title="Sydney 3172010-10-26" src="http://blog.lesterpickerphoto.com/wp-content/uploads/2010/11/Sydney-3172010-10-26-199x300.jpg" alt="" width="199" height="300"></a></p>

<p>One can choose to walk around Darling Harbour or cross an always-busy pedestrian bridge that links both sides in the middle of the harbor. There is an Imax theater, convention center, every ethnic food imaginable, even a bagel shop that… well, it’s not a New York bagel, but it’s good.</p>

<p>The harbor itself is humming with boat traffic, mostly tourist venues taking people out for a cruise around the famed Sydney Opera House. But there are also jet boat tours, kayakers galore, even fishermen fishing at harbor’s edge. Replicas of the original lighthouse and of Captain Cook’s ship, The Endeavor, draw in tourist crowds.</p>

<p><a href="http://blog.lesterpickerphoto.com/wp-content/uploads/2010/11/Sydney-3192010-10-26.jpg"><img class="size-medium wp-image-675" title="Sydney 3192010-10-26" src="http://blog.lesterpickerphoto.com/wp-content/uploads/2010/11/Sydney-3192010-10-26-300x199.jpg" alt="" width="300" height="199"></a></p>

<p>One interesting eatery is Grill’d Burger, where one can grab burgers of every description, including three different kinds of veggie burgers, plus a selection of Aussie beers. It is relatively inexpensive as far as Sydney prices go.</p>

<p>Sydney also boasts an active Asian community, and Chinatown here is well known for its shops and high quality restaurants. Just a few blocks from Darling Harbor, on Sussex Street, you’ll find one of the best restaurants on the outskirts of Chinatown, a fusion Thai property known as Home Thai. Let’s just say that I challenge you to find better tasting Asian food anywhere! A telling sign was that, with the exception of two other men, my wife and I were the only Caucasians present. Pad Thai may sound boring to you by now, but try it here and you won’t regret it. I saved half of my generous portion to eat for breakfast the next day.</p>

<p><a href="http://blog.lesterpickerphoto.com/wp-content/uploads/2010/11/Sydney-4002010-10-27.jpg"><img class="size-medium wp-image-677" title="Sydney 4002010-10-27" src="http://blog.lesterpickerphoto.com/wp-content/uploads/2010/11/Sydney-4002010-10-27-199x300.jpg" alt="" width="199" height="300"></a></p>

<p>And, speaking of breakfast, if you’re near Darling Harbour at that hour, you simply must try Waldemere’s, a small boutique establishment run by Menno Tabbernal, a Dutch immigrant with a degree in hospitality management. It shows in his exceptional attention to customer service and the meticulous way Waldemere’s food is served. From basic yogurt with granola and fruit to eggs and brown bread, every dish is superb. The restaurant also offers free Wifi, not universally available in Sydney, so the pricey nature of Waldemere’s is more than made up for by its relaxed atmosphere and warm hospitality.   Next up… New Caledonia!</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>Sydney is an amazing city, as much for its vitality and friendly residents as it is for the scads of things to see, do and taste. In my last blog I described the character of the city. Today I’ll suggest some places to visit.</p>

<p>Sydney is a city of iconic locations, the most famous of which is undoubtedly the Sydney Opera House, an immense complex of theaters and exhibition halls nestled under what is arguably the most famous roof- actually series of roofs- in the world. No matter from what part of the harbor you view them, the gleaming white shells are impressive, indeed.</p>

<p>The Opera House is fun to walk through and around, each walkway offering a different and intimate view of the famed architecture. But the secret to a fun day in Sydney is in <em>getting</em> to the Opera House. Most tourists take a taxi or bus there. Let me suggest a better way.</p>

<p><a href="http://blog.lesterpickerphoto.com/wp-content/uploads/2010/10/Sydney-2302010-10-26.jpg"><img class="size-medium wp-image-666" title="Sydney 2302010-10-26" src="http://blog.lesterpickerphoto.com/wp-content/uploads/2010/10/Sydney-2302010-10-26-199x300.jpg" alt="" width="199" height="300"></a></p>

<p>Start out in the morning at the north end of Hyde Park, where you’ll take in the view of the immense St. Mary’s Cathedral. Sit at the impressive Archibald Memorial Fountain in the midst of the park and you will hear high-caliber street musicians serenading passersby. On our visit a young flamenco guitarist mesmerized tourists and residents with his fingering dexterity and wide range of musical selections. Enjoy the well-groomed gardens and take in the pleasing architecture of the cathedral itself. When you’re ready, start your walk down Art Gallery Road, which takes off from the northeast end of the park. In a few hundred yards you enter The Domain, a huge public park enjoyed by Sydneyites year round.</p>

<p><a href="http://blog.lesterpickerphoto.com/wp-content/uploads/2010/10/Sydney-2352010-10-26.jpg"><img class="aligncenter size-medium wp-image-667" title="Sydney 2352010-10-26" src="http://blog.lesterpickerphoto.com/wp-content/uploads/2010/10/Sydney-2352010-10-26-199x300.jpg" alt="Art Museum" width="199" height="300"></a></p>

<p>Within another few hundred yards you come to the Art Gallery of New South Wales, a fresh, airy and delightful museum. Aboriginal art and culture dominates (no photography allowed), but there are also galleries devoted to European artists where you can also photograph to your heart’s content. Sprinkled throughout the museum are places to sit and contemplate. The café is simply wonderful. Our meals were freshly prepared, nicely seasoned and, uncommon for Sydney, reasonably priced.</p>

<p>Once out of the museum, continue walking along the same road, which now turns into Mrs. Macquaries Road. At the point there is a stone bench dedicated to a former governor’s wife. From the point you’ll enjoy commanding views of part of Sydney harbor, especially across the cove to the Opera House.</p>

<p><a href="http://blog.lesterpickerphoto.com/wp-content/uploads/2010/10/Sydney-1542010-10-26.jpg"><img class="size-medium wp-image-668" title="Sydney 1542010-10-26" src="http://blog.lesterpickerphoto.com/wp-content/uploads/2010/10/Sydney-1542010-10-26-200x300.jpg" alt="" width="200" height="300"></a></p>

<p>As you continue around the cove, stroll into the Royal Botanical Gardens and admire the vast collection of plants and trees, including a huge diversity of palms. As you go deeper into the gardens, keep glancing up. Eventually you will spot some fruit bats, then more, and more and more. The Gardens are home to thousands of these immense, harmless creatures, who graze on the abundant figs and other fruits in and around the park. It’s fascinating to watch them grooming as they hang upside-down. They are a loud bunch, too, yelping and calling to each other and creating a cacophony of sound that surrounds you. If you time the visit right, at dusk, you’ll see them flying off on their appointed rounds.</p>

<p>Now simply continue your walk along the cove and you’ll be in the vicinity of the Opera House. But hold off for a little while, if you can.</p>

<p><a href="http://blog.lesterpickerphoto.com/wp-content/uploads/2010/10/Sydney-932010-10-25.jpg"><img class="size-medium wp-image-669" title="Sydney 932010-10-25" src="http://blog.lesterpickerphoto.com/wp-content/uploads/2010/10/Sydney-932010-10-25-199x300.jpg" alt="" width="199" height="300"></a></p>

<p>Right near the Opera House is a captivating area of historic streets and structures. The tiny, but interesting Discovery Museum sits tucked away on a narrow alleyway called Kendall Lane. Across from this must-see museum, is a shopping mall. Once out of the mall, deservedly well-known restaurants, patisseries and pubs surround you. Pick any one and you can’t go wrong. Better yet, take something to go.</p>

<p>Now you’re ready for the Opera House. Walk the few remaining blocks and…</p>

<p>No, wait a minute! First take a detour. It’s still only late afternoon, the perfect time to take a side trip up Argyle Street to The Sydney Observatory. The Opera House will wait (the best time to see it is toward dusk anyway).</p>

<p><a href="http://blog.lesterpickerphoto.com/wp-content/uploads/2010/10/Sydney-1532010-10-25.jpg"><img class="size-medium wp-image-670" title="Sydney 1532010-10-25" src="http://blog.lesterpickerphoto.com/wp-content/uploads/2010/10/Sydney-1532010-10-25-300x199.jpg" alt="" width="300" height="199"></a></p>

<p>The Observatory sits atop a hill, with a panoramic view of Sydney. It is a historic structure housing an astronomical observatory, now defunct, but turned into a terrific little museum. Here you can see photo exhibits of the planets, stars and galaxies, as well as historically interesting exhibits on Australian astronomy.</p>

<p>The grounds offer up a lovely garden, places to sit peacefully and take in the Sydney skyline. Enjoy your take-out while sitting on a bench under mammoth ficus trees. Okay, when you’re done, you’re <em>now</em> ready for the Opera House. Trek back down Argyle Street, stroll around Circular Quay and you’ll see streets leading to the Opera House on your left.  Enjoy!</p>

<p>In my next blog we’ll explore another popular Sydney area.</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>The past three days have been wonderful, as we toured Sydney about as hard as any travel photojournalist could. My tendency is to try out-of-the-way venues to add value to my readers’ experience, and this visit was no exception.   First, some impressions. Sydney is as high energy as Manhattan, and I don’t say that idly, since I am a native New Yawkah. Sydney is every bit as frenetic and cosmopolitan, but in a wholly different way. We’re here in late October (spring) and it is sunny and bright, with the expected periodic rain showers.</p>

<p>The city revolves around the water. Sydney is blessed with numerous harbors and the Aussies have developed them to a fine art. Take Baltimore’s Inner Harbor, New York’s South Street Seaport, San Francisco’s Fisherman’s Wharf and crank  them up a notch or two and you have an idea of what a happening place an attraction like Darling Harbour, for example, is. People are busily shopping, leisurely strolling, savoring the diverse eateries, or else kayaking and biking along this massive urban playground.</p>

<p><a href="http://blog.lesterpickerphoto.com/wp-content/uploads/2010/10/Sydney-42010-10-26.jpg"><img class="size-medium wp-image-659" title="Sydney 42010-10-26" src="http://blog.lesterpickerphoto.com/wp-content/uploads/2010/10/Sydney-42010-10-26-300x199.jpg" alt="" width="300" height="199"></a></p>

<p>Oh, did I mention biking? Sydney is a biker’s dream. Bicyclists are everywhere, probably due, at least in part, to the ridiculously high parking fees in the city. We parked overnight, from 10:00 PM to 10:00 AM and it cost $72.00. While we walked around town, construction was going on in several places to increase the number of bike paths and also make the city more walker friendly, something that 97% of Sydneyites requested in a recent survey.</p>

<p>And that is needed, because right now the city suffers from too many cars and excessive car noise. At some point every day my eyes burned from the car exhaust. But Sydneyites have learned to coexist with cars. They are an extraordinarily patient lot, as they wait for the walk signals to turn green, sometimes a very long wait due to the heavy traffic. The one time I impatiently crossed before the green pedestrian go-ahead light, I was pegged as a foreigner and stared down by a crowd of residents.</p>

<p>One thing you will find out as soon as you have your first meal in Sydney is that it is one expensive city. A small bottled water is $3.00, a cup of hot tea is $3.50, and meals… forget trying to get a decent meal for less than $30, not including spirits.</p>

<p><a href="http://blog.lesterpickerphoto.com/wp-content/uploads/2010/10/Sydney-32010-10-26.jpg"><img class="size-medium wp-image-660" title="Sydney 32010-10-26" src="http://blog.lesterpickerphoto.com/wp-content/uploads/2010/10/Sydney-32010-10-26-300x199.jpg" alt="" width="300" height="199"></a></p>

<p>To encourage walking, there are skywalks galore, pedestrian tunnels and bridges. A monorail takes residents and tourists alike all along the downtown. Modern buses provide easy public transportation options. Sydneyites do walk a lot, but they also exercise in other ways. During lunch hours we noticed individuals and organized groups meeting to run together, do aerobics and yoga.</p>

<p><a href="http://blog.lesterpickerphoto.com/wp-content/uploads/2010/10/Sydney-52010-10-26.jpg"><img class="size-medium wp-image-661" title="Sydney 52010-10-26" src="http://blog.lesterpickerphoto.com/wp-content/uploads/2010/10/Sydney-52010-10-26-300x199.jpg" alt="" width="300" height="199"></a></p>

<p>The architecture parallels that of the major North American cities; tall skyscrapers, and showcase buildings by well-known architects. Buildings are full of light and texture, very inviting and pleasing to the eye. For those of us in the U.S., Sydney does present us with a mystery. Where are the homeless people? In three days, I could not find one homeless person on the streets or in the city’s many parks.</p>

<p><a href="http://blog.lesterpickerphoto.com/wp-content/uploads/2010/10/Sydney-22010-10-26.jpg"><img class="size-medium wp-image-662" title="Sydney 22010-10-26" src="http://blog.lesterpickerphoto.com/wp-content/uploads/2010/10/Sydney-22010-10-26-199x300.jpg" alt="" width="199" height="300"></a></p>

<p>Today we spent four hours in the Royal Botanic Gardens. Four hours? Well, for starters the gardens and the public park adjoining it are the size of the entire Sydney city center. The park and gardens wrap around a cove and offer a peaceful oasis from the hustle and bustle of the city. The park is immaculately clean, as is the entire city, by the way. The gardens are interesting not only for those fascinated with flowers and trees, but for one of their most amazing residents. But I’m not revealing what that resident is until my next blog, where I’ll share specifics on restaurants, lodging and tourist attractions that you might want to consider if⎯ no, make that when⎯ you get to Sydney.</p>
