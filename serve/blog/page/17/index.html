  <div class="entry-content"><p>I leave tomorrow for a week photographing in Zion National Park, a location I have long been wanting to visit. No, I’ve never been before. So many choices, so little time.</p>

<p>I’ll be traveling with my friend and colleague Daniel Stainer, a very advanced amateur (I consider him a pro and have featured him before in my blog: <a href="http://blog.lesterpickerphoto.com/2011/04/25/through-the-eyes-of-daniel-stainer/">http://blog.lesterpickerphoto.com/2011/04/25/through-the-eyes-of-daniel-stainer/</a>).</p>

<p>What makes this trip different for me, aside from the location, is that I will be carrying only my new Hasselblad equipment with me. For the first time since 1969 I am using a second camera system. By no means am I giving up my trusty Nikons. That camera system is still a dream with all its advanced technologies and capabilities and it still rules for wildlife imagery and most landscapes.</p>

<p>It’s just that nowadays my clients are requesting larger images for display purposes, which necessitates a much larger sensor and higher pixel count. I tried experimenting with large format film cameras earlier in the year, but my 4x5 Arca Swiss camera, lenses, film and extras were just too heavy and bulky to shlep around comfortably. I stepped up to Hassy just a month ago and so far am most pleased with the results, which I hope to share with you over the next few weeks. Here is one of my first images with the Hassy, taken at a local stream. I used my H4D-50 with a 120mm lens, ISO 50, f32, 2.5 seconds, -0.3 exposure compensation. This is the RAW file, processed as a jpeg for posting here, so it will lose lots of tonality in translation.</p>

<p>As always I’ll blog from on site and you can follow my trails in real time through my SPOT GPS transmitter. Just go to this URL:</p>

<p>I’ll start going live on Sunday, November 6 when we begin hiking to our photo locations.</p>

<p>Hope you are all enjoying the last bits of Fall. It was a pretty disappointing color show here in the mid-Atlantic, at least compared to other years. Now it’s time to ready equipment and clothing for the winter shooting season.</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>Tomorrow Bob (my assistant) and I are off to NYC for PhotoPlus, a 2-day photography convention. The Jacob Javits Conference Center will feature camera and equipment exhibitors from around the world.</p>

<p><a href="http://blog.lesterpickerphoto.com/wp-content/uploads/2011/10/logo.jpg"><img class="alignnone size-medium wp-image-1741" title="logo" src="http://blog.lesterpickerphoto.com/wp-content/uploads/2011/10/logo-300x75.jpg" alt="" width="300" height="75"></a></p>

<p>Our main purpose for going is to spend time interacting with the Hasselblad people, since I&#8217;m still on the learning curve with my new H4D-50 camera and lenses. I have so far found the technicians and the sales people to be incredibly helpful and highly knowledgeable. I&#8217;m looking forward to some workshops and discussions with staff and hope to learn a few tips and techniques myself. I&#8217;ll also soon be highlighting some images I have taken with my new Hassy. All I can say is that I&#8217;m loving its capabilities and results.</p>

<p>I&#8217;ll also be visiting my old workhorse, Nikon. I&#8217;ve used Nikon equipment exclusively since 1969, when I bought my first Nikon F while I was a cub newspaper reporter/photographer/coffee boy. I&#8217;m now a proud member of Nikon Photographic Services, which qualifies me for a free sensor cleaning at tomorrow&#8217;s show (whoopee!). I&#8217;m also eager to see what Nikon has in store for us professionals in the coming year, but I suspect that, as always, they will be mum on that issue. A high end Nikon to replace the industry-leading D3x is long overdue and the subject of daily rumors regarding its replacement. I&#8217;m eager to get that new little toy before my trip to Africa in January.</p>

<p>We&#8217;ll also visit some of the accessory suppliers that we use that will be exhibiting at the show, as well as sitting in on workshops where we&#8217;ll hopefully get some ideas to enhance our business.</p>

<p>I&#8217;ll report anything interesting I find at the PhotoPlus convention, so stay tuned.</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>It’s been a week since I’ve posted a blog, but what an event-filled week it’s been!  So, here’s my excuse. I spent part of the week in the hospital, admitted through the Emergency Room. I’ll explain, embarrassing though it may be.</p>

<p>Those of you who read my blog know that recently, in a moment of pure madness, I splurged on a new camera system, the incredible Hasselblad H4D-50 with a series of lenses. My clients are demanding larger and larger prints and at times my Nikon 12 mega-pixel D700 just doesn’t cut it. I love my Nikon equipment, especially for wildlife action, but my landscape work seems to be trending toward the larger 50 mega-pixel Hasselblad size.</p>

<p>Over the past two weeks since I got the camera system I have been trying to learn its intricacies prior to my traveling to Zion National Park in November, where I intend to get it to earn back some of its absurd cost. Therein lies the rub… or catch, as you’ll see.</p>

<p>As I was fiddling with the Hassy grip, which doubles as the battery, at one point I got my thumb wedged in the space between the grip and the body. For a moment I couldn’t release it. It hurt for a few seconds, but I thought nothing of it.</p>

<p><a href="http://blog.lesterpickerphoto.com/wp-content/uploads/2011/10/LAP4066.jpg"><img class="size-medium wp-image-1737" title="_LAP4066" src="http://blog.lesterpickerphoto.com/wp-content/uploads/2011/10/LAP4066-199x300.jpg" alt="" width="199" height="300"></a></p>

<p>The next day, my assistant, Bob, and I drove to the Hasselblad repair facility in northern New Jersey to get a quirky lens checked out. All of a sudden, my thumb swelled up and turned a very ugly shade of black-and-blue. Since I once had a blood clot in my leg following surgery, I called my vascular surgeon, who suggested I get my butt to a hospital right away.</p>

<p>Of course given my history of a prior clot, the admitting Resident figured it had to be a clot. In any event, he wasn’t buying my story about the camera wedgie. So, I was admitted to the absolutely wonderful Robert Wood Johnson University Hospital where, for the next 24 hours I was pricked, prodded, stuck, taped, tested, retested and asked the same questions over and over by a truly terrific, friendly staff.</p>

<p>Finally, late in the afternoon the head vascular surgeon came into my room, took one look at my thumb and told me to get the hell out of there! Whew! What a relief.</p>

<p>So, who ever said that photography wasn’t a contact sport?</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>Let&#8217;s face it, we all get a lot of junk in our email box every day. Ninety percent I delete without ever opening them. I especially hate it when someone sends me time-wasting videos. Eight minutes into some stupid video I still don&#8217;t know what the point of the damned thing is.</p>

<p>That&#8217;s why I was dubious when I received a video from one of my colleagues with a note urging me to watch it. But I trust this guy, so I clicked on the link. I was immediately enthralled. That&#8217;s why I urge you to do the same. Spend 3 minutes and 30 seconds for a real treat.</p>

<p><a href="http://blog.lesterpickerphoto.com/wp-content/uploads/2011/10/200885447_1001.jpg"><img class="size-full wp-image-1733" title="200885447_100" src="http://blog.lesterpickerphoto.com/wp-content/uploads/2011/10/200885447_1001.jpg" alt="" width="100" height="75"></a></p>

<p>Without giving this away, what you will be watching is a video of a string of time lapse images of various iconic landscapes, some spanning the night, others the daylight. What first caught my eye were the images themselves, all of them expertly captured. Halfway into the video, though, I  began to appreciate the absolutely Herculean task the photographer, Dustin Farrell, had accomplished. There have got to be at least 10,000 images that comprise this video!</p>

<p>After you watch it, take a moment to read his brief description of how he managed to capture them. Incredible!</p>

<p>Enjoy!</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>After a year of researching, testing, talking to colleagues and trying out various cameras, I finally made the plunge. Just last week I purchased a digital medium format system, after researching both the brand new Pentax 645D and the relatively new Hasselblad H4D system. The hammer came down on the Hasselblad (oh, God, please not literally!!).</p>

<p><a href="http://blog.lesterpickerphoto.com/wp-content/uploads/2011/10/LAP39131.jpg"><img class="size-medium wp-image-1707 " title="_LAP3913" src="http://blog.lesterpickerphoto.com/wp-content/uploads/2011/10/LAP39131-300x199.jpg" alt="" width="300" height="199"></a></p>

<p>If you’re a regular reader of my blog you know that I tried a large format (LF) system for nearly a year. I finally decided it was too cumbersome for my needs, of which mobility is paramount. I am fortunate to get to travel to iconic locations, but that often involves strenuous hiking or situations where I have to limit my luggage. My wonderful Arca Swiss LF system with many lenses is now up for sale (interested?).</p>

<p>So, after going back to the drawing board, I realized that a medium format (MF) system was my next option. My present Nikon cameras shoot at 12 megapixels to as high as 25. My Hasselblad H4D-50 creates digital files that are 50MP! My clients are increasingly requesting very large images to hang on the walls of hospitals, offices and private homes and these large MF files will allow us to create very large prints, indeed.</p>

<p><a href="http://blog.lesterpickerphoto.com/wp-content/uploads/2011/10/LAP39181.jpg"><img class="size-medium wp-image-1708" title="_LAP3918" src="http://blog.lesterpickerphoto.com/wp-content/uploads/2011/10/LAP39181-199x300.jpg" alt="" width="199" height="300"></a></p>

<p>So far I’ve had the camera and lenses for only a few days, but from what I see so far, I’m thrilled. You may also know that I’m still recovering from hand surgery, so my assistant, Bob, has had to hoist the hefty Hasselblad onto the tripod for me so I can start getting used to it. I’m looking forward to exploring its capabilities.</p>

<p>Over the next few weeks I’ll be reporting on my experience with the Hasselblad. So, if you’re interested in this aspect of photography, stay tuned. In the meantime, happy shooting!</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>I was in the midst of writing a blog when I learned of the death of Steve Jobs just a few minutes ago. I am truly saddened by the loss of this icon of our generation.</p>

<p><a href="http://blog.lesterpickerphoto.com/wp-content/uploads/2011/10/images.jpeg"><img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-1711" title="images" src="http://blog.lesterpickerphoto.com/wp-content/uploads/2011/10/images.jpeg" alt="" width="194" height="259"></a></p>

<p>As a disclaimer, our business is a wholly Apple technology enterprise. We have Apple desktop computers, laptops, iPods, iPads and soon to be the newest iPhone 4S. My incredibly talented associate, Bob, is nothing short of an Apple expert and I know he will particularly mourn the passing of this man.</p>

<p>Steve Jobs was a visionary responsible for creating a business from scratch that employed tens of thousands of people. His techno products fueled an entire industry of businesses that sold his wares so that, by extension, he indirectly created tens of thousands of additional jobs and new wealth. Above all, his inventions were fun to use and made us more productive.</p>

<p>But, what I think distinguished Jobs was his vision of what technology could be. His products were elegant. They worked. His meticulous attention to detail gave us time savers like the iPod Touch, a device I simply could not be without. Now with the advent of the new iPhone 4S, we are standing on the doorstep of StarTrek’s communicator and HAL 9000 rolled into one.</p>

<p>I hope that others will take up Jobs’ mantle and continue his legacy. I, for one, am depending on it. In any case, we’ll miss you, Steve.</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>I’ve been photographing for several decades now, and to this day I am mystified by the lengths some people will go to get a photo. Oh, I’m not talking about the well-trained pro who carefully weighs the risks and operates on the edge to bring home the goods (more on that later). No, I’m talking about regular people who take insane risks in the name of a photograph.</p>

<p>For one thing, I’m thinking about that moron at the Grand Canyon who leaped across a chasm- <strong>in flip-flops!-</strong> onto a tiny ledge- <strong>carrying his equipment!!-</strong> to take a stupid picture. If you haven’t seen it yet, here it is: <a href="http://www.snopes.com/photos/natural/canyonleap.asp">http://www.snopes.com/photos/natural/canyonleap.asp</a></p>

<p>I know full well the arguments about whether or not there is a ledge just out of view of the camera, but even if there is, it’s about 15 feet lower. I have been to the Grand Canyon many times and know that ledge well. Assuming it is ‘only’ 15 feet below, it is very, very narrow and to slip from that ledge would mean a 2,500-foot fall. My point here is that attempting that crazy maneuver is a very, very dumb thing to do. A man died in 2007 from attempting a similar stupid photography maneuver at the Canyon. Photo injuries happen there every year.</p>

<p><a href="http://blog.lesterpickerphoto.com/wp-content/uploads/2011/10/image309.jpg"><img class="size-full wp-image-1691" title="image309" src="http://blog.lesterpickerphoto.com/wp-content/uploads/2011/10/image309.jpg" alt="" width="683" height="1024"></a></p>

<p>I’m prompted to write this by my visit to Haines, Alaska last month. Hundreds of tourists were there to photograph bears feasting on the annual salmon run. You would not believe the chances some people took, allowing bears to virtually come right up to them. These were ordinary people with no bear spray or other protection. Obviously they also had no education about bears (or higher mental functions for that matter). Ninety-nine people will get away with bad behavior regarding animals and then the 100<sup>th</sup> will get mauled and then people are shocked. Shocked? The animal is doing what comes naturally. If you are in its path, or waving a camera in its face, or running from it at the last moment, then what on earth do you expect?</p>

<p><a href="http://blog.lesterpickerphoto.com/wp-content/uploads/2011/10/LAP1975.jpg"><img class="size-medium wp-image-1692" title="_LAP1975" src="http://blog.lesterpickerphoto.com/wp-content/uploads/2011/10/LAP1975-200x300.jpg" alt="" width="200" height="300"></a></p>

<p>People also need to realize that taking chances with animals endangers the rest of us photographers, as well as the bears themselves. Shortly after my visit, a woman was, in fact, mauled there, according to local reports. BTW, do you know what happened to that sow after she mauled that tourist? Her cubs were deemed old enough and she was euthanized. Getting too close to wildlife, feeding them, helping them lose their healthy fear of humans is bad for all involved.</p>

<p>What I’d like to emphasize here is responsible photography. Responsible photography respects the animals we photograph. It forces us to read about them, search the Internet about their behaviors, ask experts, hire a guide, as we steadily gain experience.</p>

<p><a href="http://blog.lesterpickerphoto.com/wp-content/uploads/2011/10/LAP_4997.jpg"><img class="aligncenter size-medium wp-image-1693" title="LAP_4997" src="http://blog.lesterpickerphoto.com/wp-content/uploads/2011/10/LAP_4997-300x199.jpg" alt="" width="300" height="199"></a></p>

<p>Responsible photography also means safe photography. It requires that we take every safety precaution possible, including avoiding direct contact with animals. It means wearing clothing that protects against falls, stings, poisonous plants and the sun. It means wearing appropriate footwear at all times. It means understanding the terrain, the weather and the environmental conditions and then outfitting yourself to manage those conditions.</p>

<p>Due to the Internet, people are more exposed to places that before were left (and I believe best left) to professionals. That has brought tourists far beyond their experience level. In most cases there’s nothing wrong with that, but then it’s incumbent on the person to know his or her limits and act responsibly. Nowhere is that truer than photography, where we tend to be very focused (no pun intended) on the image and may not pay attention to safety issues around us. Last year, for example, a man died from a fall in the Grand Canyon while backing up to take a shot.</p>

<p>I’m not saying everyone should do this, but here is what I did before my Yukon trip. Although I’ve been to the Yukon six times, I still did my research. I also scoured the Internet for Yukon information. I downloaded sunrise and sunset times and topographical information at every site I planned to visit. I called friends to ask about bear sightings. I took along a local expert photographer with years of bear photographing experience. I brought along appropriate clothes, bear spray, and a good first aid kit… the list goes on. I wanted to be confident enough to be able to concentrate on my photography.</p>

<p>So, please, be careful when you are out there. Have fun, but first and foremost, be safe.</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>As you can see, I had a bit of surgery two days ago.</p>

<p><a href="http://blog.lesterpickerphoto.com/wp-content/uploads/2011/09/photo.jpg"><img class="aligncenter size-medium wp-image-1614" title="photo" src="http://blog.lesterpickerphoto.com/wp-content/uploads/2011/09/photo-300x225.jpg" alt="" width="300" height="225"></a></p>

<p>This is the second time I had to undergo this repair of the arthritic base of my left thumb. The first time, about 5 years ago, the repair did not work and it&#8217;s been getting steadily more painful as I balance my camera in my left hand. So I felt I had little choice. So I&#8217;m typing this with one finger, just to let you know that my communications this week will be a bit sparse.</p>

<p>I&#8217;ll have this cast and wrap on for 10 days, then move to a light-weight cast for another month. The first week in November I&#8217;m heading to Zion National Park with my photo buddy <a href="http://www.danielstainer.com">Daniel Stainer</a>, so it&#8217;s either got to be ready by then or else Daniel will have to put up with some good whine the whole trip. Sorry, Daniel!</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>Perhaps you’ve noticed in the past several days that we have changed the look of my blog a bit. For one thing the color scheme is slightly different. But the larger change is in our logo, which is now Les Picker Fine Art Photography (a big thanks to my able assistant, Bob Boyer, who designed the new logo).</p>

<p><a href="http://blog.lesterpickerphoto.com/wp-content/uploads/2011/09/logo.png"><img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-1608" title="logo" src="http://blog.lesterpickerphoto.com/wp-content/uploads/2011/09/logo.png" alt="" width="177" height="39"></a></p>

<p>The reason for the change is far more than marketing, and its implications run deep for me (and, as you will see, will be costly, too). My clients, from individuals to hospitals and offices, are using my images as wall art. At the same time, our very discriminating clients are looking for large images that make a statement. They choose my work for many reasons, some of which I’ll probably never know. But many tell me it is for the serenity they get from my naturescapes, the dynamic visual statement they make, or perhaps just the splashes of color or the emotional depth of a classic black and white print.</p>

<p>The decision to change our logo to be in sync with our evolving business was not made casually. We debated this for months. In the end, we decided to also pony up to the bar and upgrade our equipment to meet these marketplace demands.</p>

<p>Earlier this year I attempted to get into large format view camera photography since the huge film sheets allow for big enlargements. After eight months of effort, I decided to abandon large format because it did not suit my work style, which involves lots of fieldwork, flying and hiking to remote places; a shame really, because I love large format film images.</p>

<p>Now I’m actively researching and trying out various medium format (MF) camera system alternatives. This should give me a large enough digital image and pixel count to create very large prints that will meet my exacting demands. I’m currently focusing (excuse the pun) on the new Hasselblad H4D line (between 30 and 200 megapixels!) and the brand-spanking new Pentax 645D (weighing in at a respectable 40 MP). Compare that with 12 MP or 24MP for the best Nikon cameras currently on the market. Unfortunately, these medium format cameras also cost a bundle.</p>

<p><a href="http://blog.lesterpickerphoto.com/wp-content/uploads/2011/09/images.jpeg"><img class="size-full wp-image-1609" title="images" src="http://blog.lesterpickerphoto.com/wp-content/uploads/2011/09/images.jpeg" alt="" width="267" height="189"></a></p>

<p><a href="http://blog.lesterpickerphoto.com/wp-content/uploads/2011/09/images-1.jpeg"><img class="size-full wp-image-1610" title="images-1" src="http://blog.lesterpickerphoto.com/wp-content/uploads/2011/09/images-1.jpeg" alt="" width="271" height="186"></a></p>

<p>Don’t get me wrong. I love my Nikon equipment and will continue to rely on it for wildlife imagery and some landscapes. But the MF sensors are considerably larger and will offer me several advantages which I’ll get into in depth in future blogs.</p>

<p>I’m having some hand surgery this week for a bad thumb joint. But as soon as that heals I’ll be taking out these cameras for a field test. I’ll keep you informed as I go through the selection process. Hasselblad has been kind enough to offer me a camera to test at the beginning of November. If any of you have experience with these Hasselblad or Pentax cameras, please let me know.</p>
