  <div class="entry-content"><p>I decided to leave for the airport the night before my flight to Yukon, due to our local weather forecast here in Baltimore calling for ice and snow tomorrow morning. I figured if I avoided the icy roads going down to the airport in the morning, I might have a chance of making my flight.</p>

<p>No such luck! As soon as I checked into the hotel (of course it couldn&#8217;t have happened ten minutes earlier) I got a text message that my flight had been cancelled. Don&#8217;t they de-ice planes anymore?</p>

<p>So now I&#8217;m spending the night at a b-o-r-i-n-g hotel, one of those new brands that Starwood patched together to meet the needs of stranded passengers. It&#8217;s sort of an attempt at a Euro look. Not much in the way of furnishings, yet clean and very efficient. To be honest, when I&#8217;m stranded like this I&#8217;m really not looking for more. Just a comfy bed and a quiet place to read and write and listen to music.</p>

<p><a href="http://blog.lesterpickerphoto.com/wp-content/uploads/2011/01/IMG_1376.jpg"><img class="size-medium wp-image-888" title="IMG_1376" src="http://blog.lesterpickerphoto.com/wp-content/uploads/2011/01/IMG_1376-300x198.jpg" alt="" width="300" height="198"></a></p>

<p>The dark side of my delay is that I&#8217;ll get to spend another wonderful night in a hotel tomorrow night, this time in Vancouver, since the delay will also force me to miss my connection to Whitehorse, Yukon. That means a day less photography with my friend, a fantastic Yukon-based photographer named <a href="http://www.hartmier.com">Richard Hartmier</a>. If you haven&#8217;t yet seen his work, go to his website and enjoy (and ORDER HIS BOOK). His Northern Lights images are superb.</p>

<p>Okay, back to cleaning my lenses. Stay warm.</p>

<p><strong>PS: I awoke this morning to clear skies and not even a hint of precipitation. Damn!!</strong></p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p style="margin: 0.0px 0.0px 0.0px 0.0px; font: 12.0px Helvetica;">Every so often I get asked about my creative process; how do I go about visioning a scene? How do I ‘work’ an image once it’s in my computer? How do I create photographic displays that are unique for every client? </p>


<p style="margin: 0.0px 0.0px 0.0px 0.0px; font: 12.0px Helvetica; min-height: 14.0px;"> </p>


<p style="margin: 0.0px 0.0px 0.0px 0.0px; font: 12.0px Helvetica;">Well, the burnish is now off the image of the professional photographer, namely my image. <a href="http://photo.rwboyer.com">Bob Boyer</a>, my friend and very able assistant, has documented one step in the creative process that we are currently involved in. I could explain it here, but I’ll let Bob do the talking. Suffice it to say that the behind-the-scenes work ain’t pretty. It’s sort of like getting a look at how sausage is made and should go far to remove the luster of the nature photographer out there in the wilderness! Hey, we do have families to feed!</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>It’s showtime again. In ten days I leave for a photo assignment in Yukon, Canada. This will be my fourth trip to the Yukon, a land I’ve grown to love, as much for its friendly, independent people as for its majestic scenery and incredible wildlife.</p>

<p>First some perspective. Yukon is in the northwestern corner of Canada, bordered by Alaska to its west and the Arctic Ocean to its north, British Columbia to the south and Northwest Territory to the east. It has approximately 33,000 residents, 24,000 of whom live in its capital city, Whitehorse. That leaves about 9,000 people spread over an area 20% larger than California! [BTW, California has 37 million residents. Even if you remove Los Angeles, that leaves 33 million. Hmmm!]</p>

<p><a href="http://blog.lesterpickerphoto.com/wp-content/uploads/2011/01/Grizzly.jpg"><img class="size-medium wp-image-867" title="Grizzly" src="http://blog.lesterpickerphoto.com/wp-content/uploads/2011/01/Grizzly-300x225.jpg" alt="" width="300" height="225"></a></p>

<p>There are two moose for every person in the Yukon, and nearly one bear. That’s aside from caribou herds, wolves, fox, mountain goats, mountain sheep and wood bison.</p>

<p>The scenery of the Yukon defies description. Mountains tower above lush valleys, pristine lakes mirror snow-capped mountains and the immense tundra in the north boggles the mind. But, to me, it’s the ever-present Yu-kun-ah, the mighty Yukon River that winds its way through this magnificent land, that is its icon, bringing its life-giving waters to all.</p>

<p><a href="http://blog.lesterpickerphoto.com/wp-content/uploads/2011/01/Yukon2009-Dempster-Highway-1782009-09-05.jpg"><img class="size-medium wp-image-868" title="Yukon2009-Dempster Highway 1782009-09-05" src="http://blog.lesterpickerphoto.com/wp-content/uploads/2011/01/Yukon2009-Dempster-Highway-1782009-09-05-300x199.jpg" alt="" width="300" height="199"></a></p>

<p>Twenty-five percent of Yukoners are aboriginal people, representing 14 First Nations, speaking eight different languages. Is it any wonder, then, that Yukon is a photographer’s dream?</p>

<p>But the idyllic Yukon that draws tourists by the thousands in summer is but a sliver of the true Yukon. I’ll finally visit the Yukon in winter, long a dream of mine. Yesterday it was minus 58 Fahrenheit in Dawson City and a balmy minus 36 in Whitehorse, a couple of hundred miles south. Of course that includes the wind chill factor, but since that is what my body feels, I’ll go with that measurement.</p>

<p>So, how does a photographer prepare for such conditions? Carefully. Being out in minus 50 is no lark. Ninety percent of such photography happens before one sets foot on site. There is the issue of making sure your clothing is layered and that your boots and socks can withstand such frigid conditions. There’s the research one needs to conduct on what the best synthetic balaclava is, worn underneath a hooded parka, of course. Finally, there are the hands, next to one’s eyes the most valuable asset to the photographer. In this case I’ll wear a set of thin fleece gloves underneath a warm mitten that I’ll take off for a few seconds at a time to manipulate my camera controls.</p>

<p>Photographing in extreme cold is a love-hate affair for me. Having lived in Maine for 10 years, I dread the bulkiness, the slowing of movement, the way my mind becomes numb as I wait an hour or more in the frigid cold for an animal to move into position. Yet it is also incredibly exhilarating, being out in the elements, sharing those precious moments with wildlife who struggle every minute to merely survive.</p>

<p>In such extreme cold I also worry about my equipment. In the pre-digital days, film would literally snap when being advanced in the camera. Nowadays, I know that my LCD screen in the back of my camera will slow and probably stop working at around minus 10. I’ll have to constantly remind myself to not breathe when looking through the viewfinder, else I’ll fog up the view. The mental list is long, but I force myself to go through it as I wait in order to keep my mind as sharp as possible.</p>

<p>Then there is the condensation issue,a real threat to our equipment (see my previous blog on condensation: <a href="http://blog.lesterpickerphoto.com/2011/01/06/condensation-recommendation/">http://blog.lesterpickerphoto.com/2011/01/06/condensation-recommendation/</a>). This provides me with a good outlet for my recycled Zip-Lock bags.</p>

<p>I’ll also be testing out some equipment that manufacturers have sent me to see how well they work in the field. Tests in the lab are fine, as far as they go. But being out in the field is the only way to see if working photographers can benefit from newer materials and designs.</p>

<p>My main assignment is to cover the start of the Yukon Quest dogsled race, a 1,000 mile, rough-and-tumble adventure that pits man/woman and dogs against the most brutal elements nature can muster. The Quest precedes the Iditarod by a month, but many consider it even more challenging. Surrounding the Quest is a week or more of events, including the world’s northernmost film festival.</p>

<p>I’m really looking forward to being back in the Yukon, visiting dear friends (more about them in a later blog), and photographing the snow-covered landscapes. One thing that I will do a bit differently is that I will begin using the SPOT Satellite Messenger System. This is an emergency beacon and tracking device that allows adventurers to call in an SOS. But, more than that, it also allows us to leave “tracks” that can be followed online. So, each day that I blog, I’ll post the URL address, so those of you following my progress can click on the link and up will pop a Google map with my exact location.</p>

<p>I look forward to your comments as I blog throughout my adventure. In the meantime, stay warm!</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>Here is the second installment in what I promised would be a continuing series of photo self-assignments. As I discussed in my previous self-assignment blog (<a href="http://blog.lesterpickerphoto.com/2010/07/28/photography-homework-1/">http://blog.lesterpickerphoto.com/2010/07/28/photography-homework-1/</a>) I talked about the value of these ‘homework assignments, so I won’t go over it again here, except to say that the name of the game is practice, practice, practice.</p>

<p>Today I’m suggesting a seasonal assignment, one that plagues many photographers.</p>

<h3>Shooting in the Snow</h3>


<p>Snow is white, right? Not if you’ve ever photographed it. Snow can appear white and textured or overblown and featureless. It can even appear gray or yellow, much to the frustration of even advanced amateur photographers. You definitely witness the scene one way, yet in the camera or on your print it looks entirely different.</p>

<p>The reason why this happens lies entirely with your camera’s sensor, not with your eyes. In two areas even the best sensor is no match for the human eye. The first sensor deficit in in contrast. The human eye can register a much wider contrast range than can a camera sensor. The second area where sensors lag is in recording certain scenes, such as snow. Here’s why.</p>

<h3><strong>How a Sensor Works on Snow</strong></h3>


<p>A sensor works by trying to register a scene in 18% (neutral) gray. In other words, given a scene with lots of contrast, the sensor will assign a value of 100% to the brightest part of the scene and 0% to the blackest black. So with very snowy scenes, it tends to bring down the snow values to a yucky grayish tone. In essence it tries to make it closer to 18% gray.</p>

<p>There are several ways to deal with this problem. If you are a pro or advanced amateur, and you shoot in RAW format, you have the advantage of changing your white balance during post-processing. That flexibility is one the many reasons I recommend shooting in RAW. But what if you have a point and shoot, or simply don’t want to do much post-processing of your images.</p>

<h3>Solving the Gray Snow Problem</h3>


<p>Here’s a trick you can use. Simply increase the exposure anywhere from ⅓ stop to 2 whole stops! Sounds counterintuitive, right? But increasing the exposure brightens the scene and brings the snow back to its original hue. Unfortunately, there is no hard and fast rule for how much exposure increase you’ll need. Every camera meter, sensor and scene is different, so you’ll just have to experiment with it. Remember to look at your images in your LCD screen. If you are an advanced photographer, it’s critical that you look at your histogram to see if the graph is off the right side of the screen. If it is, you have blown out highlights and you need to back off the exposure bit by bit.</p>

<p>Also, experiment with your white balance (even many point-and-shoots nowadays allow you to do this). Did you know that simply switching your white balance from Automatic to Cloudy will  warm up the snow?</p>

<p><a href="http://blog.lesterpickerphoto.com/wp-content/uploads/2011/01/falling-branch-winter-1-of-11.jpg"><img class="size-medium wp-image-861" title="falling branch winter 1 of 1" src="http://blog.lesterpickerphoto.com/wp-content/uploads/2011/01/falling-branch-winter-1-of-11-300x199.jpg" alt="" width="300" height="199"></a></p>

<h3>Now For the Homework</h3>


<p>So, in the midst of winter now, our assignment is to dress warmly, go outdoors and take our time making various exposures until we get the effect we want. Please submit some of your images here for constructive critique or bragging rights. I promise to do the same on my Yukon trip in February and I’ll post the images shortly after.</p>

<p>Good luck!</p>

If it is, you have blown out highlights and you need to back off the exposure bit by bit.</p>

<p>Also, experiment with your white balance (even many point-and-shoots nowadays allow you to do this). Did you know that simply switching your white balance from Automatic to Cloudy will  warm up the snow?</p>

<h3>Now For the Homework</h3>


<p>So, in the midst of winter now, our assignment is to dress warmly, go outdoors and take our time making various exposures until we get the effect we want. Please submit some of your images here for constructive critique or bragging rights. I promise to do the same on my Yukon trip in February and I’ll post the images shortly after.</p>

<p>Good luck!</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>Right now I&#8217;m preparing for my next photo adventure. In early February I&#8217;m leaving for the Yukon and Arctic Circle, in part to cover the incredible, 1,000 mile Quest dogsled race. The February temperature can dip to -45 degrees Fahrenheit for days at a time. In upcoming blogs I&#8217;ll describe how I prep for such extreme  cold weather photography and I&#8217;ll be blogging in real time as the race proceeds. But for now I want to cover a particular issue related to photography in cold weather, namely condensation. But allow me to start this ‘lesson,’ if you will, in the tropics.</p>

<p>A few years ago I was onboard a cruise ship, lecturing as I do on digital photography. When we arrived at Tortola, I left the air conditioned ship and headed out to photograph the tropical paradise. As soon as I exited the ship’s security zone, I took the lens cap off my camera and… that’s when the trouble started.</p>

<p>Turns out my lens was completely fogged up from condensation. I had simply forgotten one of the most elemental laws of physics; when you move from a cold environment (meaning ‘dry’) to a warm one (meaning ‘wet’), water vapor will condense onto the surfaces of the colder objects. Yes, the vapor will eventually evaporate over a period of minutes to hours, but in the meantime the clouded lenses will prevent you from taking pictures. I always remember this when I’m out photographing in winter, but it just slipped my mind in the tropical environment.</p>

<p>I have seen people frantically wiping off their lenses to remove the condensation. That simply doesn’t work, since the lens surface will re-condense the moisture until it eventually reaches the same temperature as the outside warmer air. I have also seen people just keep on taking their pictures, unaware that they will turn out blurred when they later look at the pictures, due tot he vaseline-like effect of shooting through the foggy lens. That’s especially true when dealing with small point-and-shoot cameras whose lenses are small and recessed into the camera. It’s hard to even notice the condensation.</p>

<p>But, there is a bigger problem involved with condensation. Don’t make the mistake of thinking that the condensation is showing up only on the lens surface. It is also occurring <strong><em>inside</em></strong> the camera! It may not wreak havoc the first time it happens, but it can ruin the internal electronics as that moisture corrodes the circuitry.</p>

<p>Now back to winter. The same exact phenomenon occurs in reverse. The solution to the problem is simple. Whenever you are out photographing snow scenes or family ski trips, always bring along a zip-top or otherwise totally sealable plastic bag (in other words, not a twist-tie). Just before coming indoors, place your camera in the plastic bag and seal the bag. Bring the camera in and let it sit. You will notice condensation forming on the <strong><em>outside</em></strong> of the bag. That is good! Wait until the camera achieves room temperature and then you can remove it safely.</p>

<div><a href="http://blog.lesterpickerphoto.com/wp-content/uploads/2011/01/Camera-in-Bag.jpg"><img class="aligncenter size-medium wp-image-853" title="Camera in Plastic Bag (photo courtesy Canon)" src="http://blog.lesterpickerphoto.com/wp-content/uploads/2011/01/Camera-in-Bag-268x300.jpg" alt="" width="268" height="300"></a></div>


<p>Alternately, if you are an advanced amateur or professional photographer, just leave your camera in your zippered, weatherproof backpack for several hours after you go from cold to warm before removing your cameras.</p>

<p>BTW, if you do run into a condensation problem, the thing to do is to open up your camera back, open and empty the battery compartment and any open any other covered plug-in areas and let the camera dry out as quickly as possible. If you have a DSLR, uncouple the lens from the camera body.  Make sure you also keep dust and debris from getting in at such vulnerable times.</p>

<p>In the meantime, stay warm when you are outside shooting (but that will be a separate blog!).</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>Trumpets, please! Now some fanfare…. and roll the drums. It’s my annual New Year’s Photo Resolutions, Version 2011.1 (meaning they will undoubtedly change as the year progresses). Here are my major goals.</p>

<h3>A Stitch In Time</h3>


<p>This year I plan to get into panoramas, which some of my clients are demanding. I already have a terrific tripod (Gitzo 3541) and ball head (Really Right Stuff BH-55), so with that solid base I’m going to add panoramas to my repertoire.</p>

<p>That means I will have to find, learn and then use a stitching program for panoramas. That also means I’ll have to actually shoot some panoramas. Not sure whether or not I’ll need a nodal attachment for my ball head, but I’d welcome your opinions on this. What stitching software do you use? Do you find you need a special nodal adapter to get professional looking results?</p>

<h3>Macro Managing</h3>


<p>This year I’d finally like to do more macro photography, something I really enjoy but just can’t seem to get around to doing very much. I travel a lot on assignment and it’s impossible for me to shlep a macro lens and macro attachments for my tripod, along with an appropriate lighting setup. I find I need a dedicated photo trip with just macro in mind and that’s difficult to carve out of my day. But, this year…</p>

<h3>Stage a Gallery Show</h3>


<p>If you know of a good, tasteful art gallery that welcomes nature/landscape photography exhibitions, please let me know. I’m in the market for a major show.</p>

<h3>Buy a D3x (or other 20+ megapixel Nikon camera)</h3>


<p>I need a big megapixel count since I make very large prints. I’ve waited long enough. Nikon graciously sent me a D3x to test. I liked it… a lot, but not enough to shell out $7,500 for a heavy monster with quirks. I may buy one when the price drops, or continue to wait until spring to see what new releases Nikon has in store for 2011.</p>

<p><a href="http://blog.lesterpickerphoto.com/wp-content/uploads/2011/01/nikon-d3x.jpg"><img class="aligncenter size-medium wp-image-847" title="nikon-d3x" src="http://blog.lesterpickerphoto.com/wp-content/uploads/2011/01/nikon-d3x-300x145.jpg" alt="" width="300" height="145"></a></p>

<h3>Complete an e-Book</h3>


<p>I’m working hard on developing an exciting e-Book for photographers. Once I get some shots that I need, I’ll go into the final stretch. My goal is to have it ready in May. We’ll see.</p>

<p>Now, what are <strong><em>your</em></strong> photo goals for 2011? Willing to share?</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>I’m currently doing some preliminary research for a proposed photographic workshop I’ll be leading to Egypt in November, 2012. Egypt is one of the most photogenic places on Earth, not just for its antiquities, but for its warm and friendly people. I have been to Egypt several times in my career and I find that I can never get enough of it.</p>

<p>In any event, in putting together an itinerary that I think photographers would enjoy and that would add high impact images to their portfolio, I knew that it would have to include il Fontina Island, as it is called in Arabic, and known to most of the world as Elephantine Island. il Fontina is situated smack in the middle of the Nile River, immediately opposite downtown Aswan and its famous Cornish el Nile (Nile river walk). It has carried its elephantine name since antiquity due to the huge boulders that sit near the island, resembling the curved backs of elephants. You might be surprised to know that elephants once roamed as far north as Aswan, possibly as late as 5,000 B.C., before desertification overtook southern Egypt.</p>

<p>What makes il Fontina so special are its people. Egyptians are composed of two major branches; those of mid-eastern descent and the Nubians, a dark-skinned people whose stock is from farther south, in what is present day Sudan and further south. il Fontina is populated by those of Nubian heritage. They are still Muslim, but have a rich oral history that includes their African heritage.</p>

<p><a href="http://blog.lesterpickerphoto.com/wp-content/uploads/2010/12/il-Fontina-kids-1-of-1.jpg"><img class="size-medium wp-image-842" title="il Fontina kids 1 of 1" src="http://blog.lesterpickerphoto.com/wp-content/uploads/2010/12/il-Fontina-kids-1-of-1-227x300.jpg" alt="" width="227" height="300"></a></p>

<p>Only those who have walked the dirt alleyways of il Fontina can understand what it is like. Literally five minutes by public ferry from the hustle, bustle and hawking of Aswan, you are suddenly transported to a world that existed 5,000 years ago. The houses are still built as they were in pre-Dynastic times, out of mud brick and even the more primitive mud daub construction. If you go here (<a href="http://www.lesterpickerphoto.com/photo.php?id=271&amp;gallery=egypt">http://www.lesterpickerphoto.com/photo.php?id=271&amp;gallery=egypt</a>) you can see on my Gallery website what I am talking about.</p>

<p>People still fish the Nile River using round, weighted nets that are tossed by hand. Fellucas sail lazily by, their masts silhouetted by the cloudless azure sky. The only sounds you’ll hear are the bleating of goats and the calls of mothers to children when strangers come near. Women dress in traditional Muslim garb as they walk barefoot around one of the two villages (<a href="http://www.lesterpickerphoto.com/photo.php?id=273&amp;gallery=egypt">http://www.lesterpickerphoto.com/photo.php?id=273&amp;gallery=egypt</a>).</p>

<p>I recall vividly a bright, February day in 2001 as I sat alone on a shoreline bluff, eating my lunch of cheese and peasant bread a few yards above the fishing fleet, watching the men and boys repairing nets and boats. Suddenly a woman appeared behind me, looking for her son. “Mohammed!,” she yelled down. Immediately at least half a dozen men looked up. I smiled at this natural by-product of Muslim life, where names are traditionally derived from one of the 99 names for Allah in the Koran.</p>

<p><a href="http://blog.lesterpickerphoto.com/wp-content/uploads/2010/12/il-Fontina-feluccas-1-of-1.jpg"><img class="size-medium wp-image-843" title="il Fontina feluccas 1 of 1" src="http://blog.lesterpickerphoto.com/wp-content/uploads/2010/12/il-Fontina-feluccas-1-of-1-300x200.jpg" alt="" width="300" height="200"></a></p>

<p>For our workshop, we will probably stay on il Fontina Island, an option that was not even  conceivable just 10 years ago. Now there is a huge, modern European-style hotel on the south side of the island. A pity, really. But my sources tell me that the people and villages of il Fontina are still lovely, a charm born of antiquity.</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>I just posted selected  images on  my website from my recent trip to Fiji and New Caledonia. They join the images I recently posted from Australia and New Zealand. Please head over to my image website by clicking on the “Lester Picker Photography” black box at the top right of this page (or top left).</p>

<p><a href="http://blog.lesterpickerphoto.com/wp-content/uploads/2010/12/Colo-I-Suva-Forest-ParkSuva-Fiji-232010-11-01.jpg"><img class="aligncenter size-medium wp-image-838" title="Colo-I-Suva Forest Park,Suva, Fiji 232010-11-01" src="http://blog.lesterpickerphoto.com/wp-content/uploads/2010/12/Colo-I-Suva-Forest-ParkSuva-Fiji-232010-11-01-200x300.jpg" alt="" width="200" height="300"></a></p>

<p>I hope you enjoy the images. As always I welcome your comments and critique.</p>

<p>After each of my trips, I offer a sale of those images for a month. I announced my Australia and New Zealand sale last week and I got a couple of messages asking whether I would be willing to extend the sale to ALL images on my website. So, in order to do my part to help stimulate the economy, I&#8217;m doing just that&#8230; <strong><em>all</em></strong> images are on sale at 25% off from now through the entire month of January. Now, you have to do your part by ordering some prints!</p>

<p>Simply add the code “January Sale” into the appropriate box when you check out and the discount will be automatically applied. We use ultra-secure PayPal payment services and we normally ship within 48 hours. However, each image is custom printed and hand-signed, and must have adequate drying time, so please be patient.</p>

<p>Thank you for your support and purchases in 2010.</p>
