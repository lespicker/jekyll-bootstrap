  <div class="entry-content"><p>One of the joys of driving around Iceland is that you won’t drive far without seeing a waterfall (&#8216;foss&#8217; in Icelandic). I don’t mean piddly little falls. In Iceland, nearly every falls is a major gusher, whether in height or volume (hydropower supplies 70% of the electricity in Iceland, with geothermal the remaining 30%).</p>

<p><a href="http://blog.lesterpickerphoto.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/05/A0019866.jpg"><img class="size-medium wp-image-2174" title="A0019866" src="http://blog.lesterpickerphoto.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/05/A0019866-300x225.jpg" alt="" width="300" height="225"></a></p>

<p>Instead of ranting on about the incredible waterfalls, I’ll give you some quick examples. The short video clips were taken with my iPhone 4S.</p>

<p><a href="http://blog.lesterpickerphoto.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/05/A0019898.jpg"><img class="size-medium wp-image-2175" title="A0019898" src="http://blog.lesterpickerphoto.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/05/A0019898-225x300.jpg" alt="" width="225" height="300"></a></p>

<p><a href="http://youtu.be/wrxp8M7oSQo">This is a smaller waterfall</a> I came across while visiting a historic site. The falls was mostly hidden by a rocky berm, but as I drove I noticed a flash of light that I thought might be a falls. We ended up hiking a fair distance to reach it, but it was worth it as we photographed it for more than an hour.</p>

<p>This next falls is one of the most famous in Iceland. <a href="http://youtu.be/PwQcdioEJbs">Known as Gullfoss</a>, it has more water flowing than Niagara Falls in upstate New York in the United States. The sound as you approach it can be intimidating, but once you see its massive power and glorious structure, you can&#8217;t help but be wowed.</p>

<p>My colleague, Richard Hartmier, and I will be visiting other major falls in Iceland, so stay tuned.</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>Photographing around Iceland, I&#8217;m struck by the incredible number of geysers dotting the landscape. These miracles of geology just steam out of the ground in the midst of fields and mountains.</p>

<p>Iceland is a geologically active island, as we all know from one of the more recent eruptions two years ago that made worldwide news and grounded commercial air traffic for weeks. I can remember back in the seventies when the island of Surtsey suddenly emerged from the ocean off the Icelandic coast.</p>

<p>The Icelanders have ingeniously tapped into its proliferation of geysers and uses volcanic steam and heat to provide nearly all the island&#8217;s electricity needs.</p>

<p>In Seltun, there is a wonderful self-guided tourist park that winds through an active geyser field.</p>

<p><a href="http://blog.lesterpickerphoto.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/05/CameraAwesomePhoto3.jpg"><img class="size-medium wp-image-2168" title="CameraAwesomePhoto" src="http://blog.lesterpickerphoto.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/05/CameraAwesomePhoto3-300x225.jpg" alt="" width="300" height="225"></a></p>

<p>Here is an example of <a href="http://youtu.be/VcMdq4XrkxY">a typical geyser field</a> (taken with my iPhone).</p>

<p>In some instances, due to constrictions in the gases&#8217; ability to escape, pressure builds up and the geysers erupt in spectacular fashion. Of course Americans are familiar with this phenomenon in the form of Old Faithful in Yellowstone National Park. In Iceland <a href="http://youtu.be/YPjMWxEsUX8">here is a geyser eruption</a> I recorded.</p>

<p>In any event, it is a strange and exciting phenomenon to an east coast American, like me.</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>Good news! My lost luggage was returned to me, two days late but otherwise unharmed. I’m a happy camper now that I have my long johns, ScotteVest fleece and jacket, hat gloves and other necessities for photographing in Iceland.</p>

<p>After two days roaming around the Kaflavik airport area and shooting handheld because my tripod was in my misplaced luggage, we took off today for the Snaefellsnes peninsula, which is northwest of the capital city of Reykjavik (pronounced Rake-a-vik). It is a gorgeous area, dotted with immense lava fields from the many eruptions that shaped the Iceland of today (and continue to shape it). The peninsula is dominated by the impressive Snaefellsjokull glacier in the center of a huge national park.</p>

<p><a href="http://blog.lesterpickerphoto.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/05/A0019482-Panorama.jpg"><img class="size-medium wp-image-2151" title="A0019482 Panorama" src="http://blog.lesterpickerphoto.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/05/A0019482-Panorama-300x66.jpg" alt="" width="300" height="66"></a></p>

<p>The peninsula juts out into the frigid north Atlantic ocean. Here, in May, the temperatures are cold and the wind a steady presence as the landscape soaks in the precious sun that now shines for 20 hours. I captured the scene of the glacier you see above at approximately 10:30 last night. It requires several layers of clothing to be able to stay out for hours photographing the landscape, especially near the water. But the rewards are many.</p>

<p>Here is a jpeg version of a 3-photo panorama I took of an interesting phenomenon that I’ve not seen anywhere else in my travels. In many places along the southern coast and the Snaefellsnes peninsula (and perhaps elsewhere but I’ve not been there yet), the lava has been colonized by a deep carpet of moss. The moss is luxurious. Wherever I pressed down with my hand it would depress a good four to six inches. These blankets of moss go on for miles.</p>

<p><a href="http://blog.lesterpickerphoto.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/05/A0019409-Panorama.jpg"><img class="size-medium wp-image-2152" title="A0019409 Panorama" src="http://blog.lesterpickerphoto.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/05/A0019409-Panorama-300x151.jpg" alt="" width="300" height="151"></a></p>

<p>If you’d like to follow my tracks around Iceland (I use the SPOT GPS system just in case I have a mishap), <a href="http://share.findmespot.com/shared/faces/viewspots.jsp?glId=0Zg1LmM9KoFvIGRUsieGHuXYN1cCXNV5a">click on this link</a> and it will take you to my personal travel page, where you’ll see a map of Iceland with my position in real time. You can magnify the map to see the terrain, roads and a satellite view. Pretty neat technology.</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>For those of you who are veteran travelers, you know the perils of finding a decent place to lodge. There are the plastic hotels, the nightmare B&amp;Bs, the $25 Internet surcharges, even bedbugs! So, when I travel and find a clean, quiet, fair-priced place to lodge, I consider it a gift.</p>

<p>The Borgarnes Bed and Breakfast in Borgarnes, Iceland is one such gift. It is nothing short of a jewel in a treasure chest of eye candy that is Iceland (at least for us photography types). Arriving exhausted after a full day&#8217;s shooting, my colleague Richard and I were more than pleasantly surprised to check in with the owner, Inger Helkadottir, a retired sheep farmer. Inger runs an immaculately clean house, that manages to radiate warmth.</p>

<p><a href="http://blog.lesterpickerphoto.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/05/photo1.jpg"><img class="size-medium wp-image-2157" title="photo" src="http://blog.lesterpickerphoto.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/05/photo1-300x225.jpg" alt="" width="300" height="225"></a></p>

<p>Outwardly unassuming, the B&amp;B sits on a ledge overlooking the harbor and the Northern Atlantic beyond. The rooms are spacious by European standards. The shared bathroom is kept spotless. Fresh towels and washcloths, as well as comfortable bathrobes are provided.</p>

<p>There is a comfortable sitting room with to-die-for views of the harbor and rocky, bird-filled islets. The house sits at the end of a quiet street, so we each had  a blissfully restful sleep.</p>

<p><a href="http://blog.lesterpickerphoto.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/05/photo-copy.jpg"><img class="size-medium wp-image-2158 " title="photo copy" src="http://blog.lesterpickerphoto.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/05/photo-copy-300x225.jpg" alt="" width="300" height="225"></a></p>

<p>Breakfast included pancakes, cereals, cheese, freshly baked whole grain bread (baked by Inger), vegetables, juice, sliced eggs, and fresh jams. In fact, despite our rigorous shooting schedule, Richard and I decided to linger to enjoy the solitude and the views.</p>

<p>If you ever find yourself in Borgarnes, Iceland, this would be a great place to stay. Inger&#8217;s email is: ingerh@internet.is</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>My plane landed in Reykjavik, Iceland, just as the sun was rising, warming the wingtip of my plane and bluing up the skies for which Iceland is famous. I figured it was a wonderful omen for my upcoming 16 days of glorious Icelandic photography.</p>

<p><a href="http://blog.lesterpickerphoto.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/05/photo.jpg"><img class="size-medium wp-image-2145" title="photo" src="http://blog.lesterpickerphoto.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/05/photo-300x225.jpg" alt="" width="300" height="225"></a></p>

<p>WRONG!</p>

<p>I deplaned, went through a police check and sleepily dragged my butt onto a shuttle to the baggage claim area (prior to a customs check). At the carousel I waited and waited as my fellow happy passengers retrieved their bags and sauntered outside. As for me&#8230; no luggage! It&#8217;s a Saturday morning and while inconvenient and a blow to my photography assignment, I figured, okay, I can deal with this for a day. But, no, it turns out that the next plane from Toronto does not arrive until Monday! Major bummer.</p>

<p>My photo colleague, Richard Hartmier, and I could not do much all day because my jacket, warm clothes, tripod and several key pieces of my equipment are in my two checked bags. It is beautiful today, with clear, blue skies, but it is also cold and very windy, so I could not tolerate being outdoors for more than a few minutes at a time. And without a tripod, a shivering landscape photographer is pretty much dead in the water.</p>

<p>So, here I am, one very frustrated photographer, still waiting to tackle Iceland&#8217;s spectacular landscapes.</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>I leave tomorrow for a 16-day photo exploration of Iceland. I&#8217;ll be accompanied by my good friend and fellow professional photographer, the curmudgeonly <a href="http://www.hartmier.com">Richard Hartmier</a>, of Yukon Territory, Canada. We have a 4-wheel vehicle reserved, but not even one place to lodge. Our plan is to rent some sleeping bags, a propane stove for coffee in the morning, a cooler for some food, and just take off for wherever our cameras point.  If we end up in one place for a few days we&#8217;ll book into a hotel or B&amp;B, but our mission is unadulterated photography. Sunrise photography, mid-day photography, sunset photography and star trails (and even, God willing, an errant aurora) photography at night.</p>

<p>Richard and I have together traveled the back, rutty roads up north of the Arctic Circle and <a href="http://blog.lesterpickerphoto.com/2011/08/28/the-bear-truth-and-other-musings/">hunted bears with our cameras in Alaska</a>. Once, in the Yukon, we were even <a href="http://blog.lesterpickerphoto.com/2011/09/02/close-encounters-of-the-bear-kind/">pestered by a grizzly while photographing</a>. Richard, of course, ran for the safety of his vehicle, leaving me and my camera gear to fend for ourselves. I jumped into his truck shortly after, and scrambled across his lap to safety. I&#8217;ve forgiven Richard; that&#8217;s the kind of guy I am. Richard, on the other hand, calls me a liar, since his version of the story differs just a tad from mine. I accept Richard&#8217;s delusions and his character flaws, plus Iceland has very few bears (just an occasional misguided polar bear), so I agreed to travel with him, even against my better judgment.</p>

<p><a href="http://blog.lesterpickerphoto.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/05/Hartmier.jpg"><img class="size-medium wp-image-2136 " title="Hartmier" src="http://blog.lesterpickerphoto.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/05/Hartmier-199x300.jpg" alt="" width="199" height="300"></a></p>

<p>Anyway, I look on this as an adventure. I will be using my SPOT Interactive GPS toy, so those of you who are interested can <a href="http://share.findmespot.com/shared/faces/viewspots.jsp?glId=0Zg1LmM9KoFvIGRUsieGHuXYN1cCXNV5a">follow my tracks</a> throughout the day or day to day. SPOT sends a signal to a satellite that relays them in real time to a computer. When you visit the site - beginning Saturday, May 5-  you&#8217;ll <a href="http://share.findmespot.com/shared/faces/viewspots.jsp?glId=0Zg1LmM9KoFvIGRUsieGHuXYN1cCXNV5a">see a map of the region and a dot where I am and have recently been</a>. If nothing else, it&#8217;ll be a fun geography lesson as we circle the island.</p>

<p>I&#8217;ll try to blog here and there when Internet connections permit. For now, Iceland Ho!</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>It took a while, but we finally purchased a brand spanking new large format printer, the Epson 9900. Here it is, after being installed in our office today:</p>

<p><a href="http://blog.lesterpickerphoto.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/05/CameraAwesomePhoto1.jpg"><img class="size-medium wp-image-2131" title="CameraAwesomePhoto" src="http://blog.lesterpickerphoto.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/05/CameraAwesomePhoto1-300x224.jpg" alt="" width="300" height="224"></a></p>

<p>Bob Boyer, my very able assistant and master of all things tech, helped me over the past few months deciding on what printer to buy. We narrowed the choices to two excellent products, the Canon ipf8300 and the Epson 9900. Since the Epson was newer, with a tad more advanced technology, we went with it.</p>

<p>It took six men to carry it up the stairs to my office. The damn thing weighed 417 pounds coming off the truck and more than 300 pounds after we tok off all the packaging and component parts. But with the very first test print we were sold (again) and knew we made the right choice.</p>

<p>The printer is extremely user-friendly, with a  display that is easy to read and understand. After we assembled the printer, inserted the 11 ink cartridges and revved it up, our first 8.5&#8221; x 11&#8221; print was right on the money. The second was a 40&#8221; x 30&#8221; monster that was spot on. Ah, love at first sight!</p>

<p><a href="http://blog.lesterpickerphoto.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/05/CameraAwesomePhoto2.jpg"><img class="size-medium wp-image-2142" title="CameraAwesomePhoto" src="http://blog.lesterpickerphoto.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/05/CameraAwesomePhoto2-300x224.jpg" alt="" width="300" height="224"></a></p>

<p>I took the picture of the print with my iPhone. The print was made on the el cheapo paper that comes with the printer for testing purposes. In the future I&#8217;ll take pictures with a better camera of images we print on high quality paper so you can judge the quality of the 9900 for yourself.</p>

<p>Up until today we had been using an HP B9180 that only allowed us to print at 13&#8221; x 19&#8221; maximum. All our large prints were sent out for processing. I find that a real pain, since I have to make sure that the lab&#8217;s color profiles match our own. That typically means two or three back-and-forth volleys with proofs and even then I was sometimes dissatisfied. Also, the labs sometimes did not offer our preferred archival photo papers, such as the exquisite Museo Silver Rag. Suddenly we are able to print 44&#8221; wide and up to 100 feet long!!</p>

<p>The fact is that our HP was also extremely finicky, and that convinced us that we needed a better alternative. At the same time, I was selected to be the exclusive artist for Sinai Hospital&#8217;s (Baltimore) new wing, slated to open in October. We will need 75-100 large prints for that installation, so that launched us on a search for a large format printer. Having our own large format printer will also allow us to expand our Limited Edition prints and will allow me to personally guarantee that each and every print will be of the absolutely highest quality.</p>

<p>I will keep you posted as we put the Epson 9900 through its paces. Right now it is looking good.</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>It’s a truism among photographers that what separates a professional from an amateur is that the pro knows when NOT to take a picture. That’s not to say that I haven’t taken some bonehead images when I knew they wouldn’t come out. But the more experience I have earned, the less often that has happened.</p>

<p>What brings this up is that I was recently on a bus tour, where there was also a very avid amateur photographer with a nice Nikon camera system and a couple of lenses. Since I always sat in the back of the bus so as not to disturb the other tourists with all my gear, I found myself watching her photographic activity with keen interest.</p>

<p>First of all, she had her camera with her at all times, even placing it on the table in front of her during all meal times. I can hardly remember what her face looks like because I rarely saw it without the camera blocking it. She must have shot thousands upon thousands of images. At one point I asked her what percentage of the images she took she would typically consider good.</p>

<p>“Oh, maybe one percent,” she told me.</p>

<p>The other thing she did was constantly take pictures from the moving bus, no matter how rutted the road and how much we shook. At times she was nearly toppling over, but still firing away. When we were stopped, with the bus idling, she would brace the camera on the seat in front of her and shoot away.</p>

<p><a href="http://blog.lesterpickerphoto.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/05/CameraAwesomePhoto.jpg"><img class="size-medium wp-image-2125" title="CameraAwesomePhoto" src="http://blog.lesterpickerphoto.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/05/CameraAwesomePhoto-300x224.jpg" alt="" width="300" height="224"></a></p>

<p>The point I’d like to make here is that a photographer should know the limits of his or her equipment. If you are shooting 100 images to get one decent one, then something is wrong. Doing more of the exact same thing and expecting different results is not rational.</p>

<p>So, one piece of advice I would give to those of you who travel by bus or train is to either forget photographing while the vehicle is moving, or else make radical changes in your camera, lenses and settings to have even a slim chance of getting something worth keeping (please see my previous blog on <a href="http://blog.lesterpickerphoto.com/2010/08/17/train-photography/">train photography</a>). First of all, photographing through dusty, dirty windows is not a recipe for success.And moving at 50 mph in a vibrating, rocking and rolling hunk of steel and expecting to get sharp images is also not realistic.</p>

<p>If you do want to try photographing from a bus/train, here is what I recommend. First, try to clean the windows before the vehicle leaves, especially on bus tours. Next, boost your ISO and open up your lens to f5.6 or so, in order to get much faster shutter speeds. That will minimize, but will probably not eliminate, blur. Of course, intentional blur might actually make a good image (again, see <a href="http://blog.lesterpickerphoto.com/2010/08/17/train-photography/">train photography</a>).</p>

<p>When the bus is stopped, but still idling, you should not rest your camera on the seat for stability. The bus is vibrating and will actually make it more difficult to get a decent image. Instead, hold your camera with your elbows at your side and shoot. That allows your body to act as a shock absorber. Not perfect, but a better alternative.</p>

<p>As far as the larger issue of shooting scads of pictures to get one decent one goes, here’s my advice, even if you did not ask for it. Try to improve your skills. Read photo books and magazines. Browse the Internet, pick a few good photo sites, visit often and pay attention. The best way to learn I have found is to take a photo workshop. But, please don’t expect your photography to improve by doing more of what hasn’t worked for you so far.</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>by <strong><a href="http://www.darwinwiggett.com">Darwin Wiggett</a></strong></p>

<p><strong><em>Les&#8217; Note: I am so pleased to offer you, my regular blog readers, this guest blog by my colleague, Darwin Wiggett. Darwin is one of Canada&#8217;s top professional landscape/nature photographers and a man whose body of work I have admired for years. His creativity and passion never cease to amaze me. Enjoy!</em></strong></p>

<p>Musicians have scales, actors have lines, painters have sketches, and athletes have workouts. Photographers have what? While all other artists have a daily routine to practice their craft, most photographers only dust off the camera when they go on a planned shoot. Imagine if musicians only played whenever they had a gig and did not practice in the time in between—can you imagine the results? Why, as photographers, do we expect that we will perform wonderfully every time we go out even without practicing in between?</p>

<p>Nothing will sharpen both your technical skills and your artistic eye faster than daily practice. Visual ‘scales’ do for the photographer what musical scales do for the musician; we constantly stay ‘tuned’ up and ready to express our art.</p>

<p>I know we all have really busy lives, so who has time to shoot every day? You might think it’s easy for me as a professional photographer to shoot daily&#8211;after all that is my job isn’t it? But to make it as a pro, you need to do some heavy marketing and selling. I only get to go on photo shoots about 1/3<sup>rd</sup> of the time, the other 2/3<sup>rd</sup> is spent doing the business part of photography (yech!). In the past, I found that between shoots I was not practicing with my camera and that my art was suffering. It often took 2 or 3 days into a trip to get back into ‘seeing’. I was not practiced and ready.</p>

<p><a href="http://blog.lesterpickerphoto.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/04/NMP12726.jpg"><img class="size-medium wp-image-2119 " title="NMP.tif" src="http://blog.lesterpickerphoto.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/04/NMP12726-300x225.jpg" alt="" width="300" height="225"></a></p>

<p>For the last two or three years I have begun to carry a small point-n-shoot digital camera with me everywhere I go. I do not have to carve out special time to shoot daily; I just take a snapshot here and there in my day as I see something interesting. I might be walking the dog, or standing in line at the bank, doing dishes or visiting the washroom. But if something catches my eye, I make an image. Now I am doing a little photography almost every day and the differences I have seen in my ability to see and be creative is amazing. I no longer have any ‘photographer’s block’ and I no longer need to ‘warm up’ before going on a serious photo shoot. I see photos everywhere!</p>

<p><a href="http://blog.lesterpickerphoto.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/04/NMP12081.jpg"><img class="size-medium wp-image-2120" title="NMP.tif" src="http://blog.lesterpickerphoto.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/04/NMP12081-300x195.jpg" alt="" width="300" height="195"></a></p>

<p>Even though I am a nature photographer, anything that catches my eye can become a photo. The great thing about shooting daily is that soon you’ll begin to remove labels from subjects and just learn to see light, pattern, form and design. You’ll see beauty in the mundane, and you’ll be inspired anywhere you go from the park to the parking lot. The better you become at photography in general, the better you’ll be at outdoor photography in particular. So do not restrict yourself to pretty nature scenes.</p>

<p><a href="http://blog.lesterpickerphoto.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/04/NMP10113A.jpg"><img class="size-medium wp-image-2121" title="NMP.tif" src="http://blog.lesterpickerphoto.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/04/NMP10113A-300x228.jpg" alt="" width="300" height="228"></a></p>

<p>Although I have mentioned the wonders of a point-n-shoot camera here before, I really think anyone who is serious about becoming a better photographer should invest in one and carry and use it. You’ll really see the huge benefits of practice. Happy shooting.</p>
