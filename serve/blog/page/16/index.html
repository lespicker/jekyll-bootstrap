  <div class="entry-content"><p>My recent addition of a Hasselblad H4D-50 camera system to my trusty Nikon system may have been a good move photographically (see my Hassy review:  <a href="http://blog.lesterpickerphoto.com/2011/11/29/review-of-the-hasselblad-h4d-50/">http://blog.lesterpickerphoto.com/2011/11/29/review-of-the-hasselblad-h4d-50/</a>), but as far as my back goes, not so much.</p>

<p>I realized that trying to cart around a full Hassy system, or a few Hassy components in addition to my Nikon equipment, would be a chiropractic nightmare using my existing backpacks, none of which has the profusion of modern high tech design elements. Plus, neither my ThinkTank Rotation 360, nor any of my other LowePro packs were roomy enough to squeeze in all my field gear, which I suspect engage in illicit acts at night when my supply closet is closed and hence multiply logarithmically.</p>

<p>At a recent PhotoPlus convention in the Big Apple, I came across the LowePro Trekker AW 400. Truthfully, I had already narrowed my search to it and two other packs, all three of which I got a chance to examine on the convention floor. But with the AW400, it was love at first sight. And, once I tried it on and felt its glove-tight custom fit, I was sold.</p>

<p><a href="http://blog.lesterpickerphoto.com/wp-content/uploads/2011/12/lowepro_pro_trekker_aw_400_20100721_135609_image.jpg"><img class="size-full wp-image-1801 " title="lowepro_pro_trekker_aw_400_20100721_135609_image" src="http://blog.lesterpickerphoto.com/wp-content/uploads/2011/12/lowepro_pro_trekker_aw_400_20100721_135609_image.jpg" alt="" width="172" height="200"></a></p>

<h3>Fitting</h3>


<p>When it was delivered to my home, I immediately tried it on and spent the next 30 minutes fine-tuning it to my body. Believe me, there are tons of adjustments available on the pack so that a tweak here and there enhance the comfort level enormously. One nifty feature that I have never seen on a photo backpack before is an adjustment allowing you to raise the pack up or down while keeping the suspension system in place. That adjustment made a world of difference to me during my one-week trip to Zion National Park.</p>

<p><a href="http://blog.lesterpickerphoto.com/wp-content/uploads/2011/12/LAP4224.jpg"><img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-1802" title="_LAP4224" src="http://blog.lesterpickerphoto.com/wp-content/uploads/2011/12/LAP4224.jpg" alt="" width="1024" height="681"></a></p>

<h3>Innovative Features</h3>


<p>I was blown away by how much I could squeeze into the AW400. It has big pockets, little pockets, front pockets and side pockets, even pockets inside pockets. The exterior shell is water resistant, which I can readily attest to after hiking in a constant rain. There is unlimited flexibility in arranging dividers and it easily fits my Nikon 200-400. Of course the trick is to not load a pack so much that it makes it impossible to hike long distances with it. That’s especially true for my 60-year old body. But, while the AW400 is indeed a large pack, it is not unwieldy. It slid onto my shoulders easily and with two quick strap adjustments I was off. And the way the AW 400 distributes the weight allowed me to cart an extra 10 pounds with me without feeling it.</p>

<p><a href="http://blog.lesterpickerphoto.com/wp-content/uploads/2011/12/LAP4220.jpg"><img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-1803" title="_LAP4220" src="http://blog.lesterpickerphoto.com/wp-content/uploads/2011/12/LAP4220.jpg" alt="" width="1024" height="681"></a></p>

<p>Another innovative feature that I enjoy is the top section of the bag. It contains two pockets that I use to store snack foods, hat, gloves and other extras.</p>

<p><a href="http://blog.lesterpickerphoto.com/wp-content/uploads/2011/12/LAP4225.jpg"><img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-1804" title="_LAP4225" src="http://blog.lesterpickerphoto.com/wp-content/uploads/2011/12/LAP4225.jpg" alt="" width="1024" height="681"></a></p>

<p>The neat thing is that the entire section is removable and morphs into a fully functional fanny pack for those days when you want to roam around town without all your photo gear. In the field what I do is wear the bag as a fanny pack even when I use the AW400. That way I can get to my extras without taking off the pack. Very convenient!</p>

<p><a href="http://blog.lesterpickerphoto.com/wp-content/uploads/2011/12/LAP4230.jpg"><img class="size-full wp-image-1805" title="_LAP4230" src="http://blog.lesterpickerphoto.com/wp-content/uploads/2011/12/LAP4230.jpg" alt="" width="1024" height="681"></a></p>

<p>There are also lots of places to which you can attach carabiners or other hardware. I use one shoulder ring to attach my SPOT GPS and the other for my filter holder.</p>

<p>Another item I enjoyed was the tiny, but well constructed, organizer bag that comes with the AW400. It’s one more thoughtful nod to the pro or advanced amateur photographer from LowePro. I find it perfect for all my adapter rings and one of my filter holders. Now they’re not clattering all over my bag.</p>

<p>The main waist belt on the AW400 includes lots of attachment points for extra pouches, a can of bear spray or to whatever else you might want quick access.</p>

<h3>Water</h3>


<p>I’ve never had a Camelback water system in a backpack before. The designers at LowePro include a side pocket that allows one to slip in a Camelback that neatly threads through the pocket and onto one of the shoulder straps. What a pleasure it was to be able to draw water whenever I needed it without having to stop and fish out my water bottle!</p>

<h3>Tripod Holder</h3>


<p>I’m not sure if it’s me, or the design of photo backpacks in general, but I have never liked the tripod carrying mechanisms they offer, and I’ve owned literally dozens of packs in my career. The tripod carry significantly shifts the center of gravity backwards and pulls the pack away from my body, making the pack feel awkward and heavier. The AW400 is no exception and I quickly shifted to my regular routine of carrying my tripod in my hand or slung over my shoulder with camera mounted.</p>

<h3>Laptop</h3>


<p>As if all these features weren’t enough, the AW400 includes a laptop sleeve and comes equipped with a thin, padded laptop bag. For me that meant that the AW400 was all I needed for an airplane carry-on. Worked like a charm.</p>

<p><a href="http://blog.lesterpickerphoto.com/wp-content/uploads/2011/12/LAP4231.jpg"><img class="size-full wp-image-1806" title="_LAP4231" src="http://blog.lesterpickerphoto.com/wp-content/uploads/2011/12/LAP4231.jpg" alt="" width="681" height="1024"></a></p>

<h3>Final Thoughts</h3>


<p>I would award the AW400 4.5 stars based on its plethora of features and its rugged construction (I suspect I would only award a backpack 5 stars if it came with a porter). The Pro Trekker AW series includes a smaller (AW300) and larger (AW600) version and I anticipate getting the AW300 for times when I am hiking light.</p>

<p>The AW400 is not cheap, at around $250. If you do a Google search, you’ll find some videos available showing the features of the Pro Trekker AW series.</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>I promised you a field report on my new Hasselblad H4D-50 system after I returned from a trip to Zion National Park where I used it exclusively and extensively. Here it is. One small caution, though; all the scenic images here I shot with my Hassy. However, they have been compressed to ridiculous small sizes in order to accommodate WordPress’ requirements (see file size descriptions, below). So don’t expect to see marked differences between the Hassy images and my Nikon images in this venue. Enlarged for wall displays, the differences are huge. <strong>You may need to click on each image to see the entire image as they may be cropped to fit the WordPress template. </strong>Anyway, here goes&#8230;</p>

<p><a href="http://blog.lesterpickerphoto.com/wp-content/uploads/2011/11/United_Kingdom_Hasselblad_H3DII_50_Multi_Shot_System_Digital_SLR_Camera722009114456PM5.jpg"><img class="size-full wp-image-1785" title="United_Kingdom_Hasselblad_H3DII_50_Multi_Shot_System_Digital_SLR_Camera722009114456PM5" src="http://blog.lesterpickerphoto.com/wp-content/uploads/2011/11/United_Kingdom_Hasselblad_H3DII_50_Multi_Shot_System_Digital_SLR_Camera722009114456PM5.jpg" alt="" width="345" height="345"></a></p>

<p>Hasselblad is what is known as a medium format system, meaning that it records an image much larger than does a 35mm camera. My Nikon D700, for example, produces an image with 12 megapixels (MP) of information packed into its file. A Nikon D3X produces 25-MP images. My Hasselblad cranks out full 16-bit images with 50 MP of information.</p>

<p><a href="http://blog.lesterpickerphoto.com/wp-content/uploads/2011/11/2011-11-Zion_0283-Edit.jpg"><img class="size-full wp-image-1780" title="2011-11-Zion_0283-Edit" src="http://blog.lesterpickerphoto.com/wp-content/uploads/2011/11/2011-11-Zion_0283-Edit.jpg" alt="" width="1024" height="768"></a></p>

<p>Most people will never need files that large if they post their images on the Web or make enlargements up to 16 x 24, for example. As a professional, I frequently have to blow up my images to insane sizes for my clients. We recently produced a 5-feet by nine-feet image for a restaurant! Stretching a 12-MP Nikon file to that high a magnification is not ideal. A Hasselblad file is better suited to the enlargements that I do, typically 24” x 36” up to 40” x 50”.</p>

<p><a href="http://blog.lesterpickerphoto.com/wp-content/uploads/2011/11/2011-11-Zion_0323-Edit.jpg"><img class="size-full wp-image-1781" title="2011-11-Zion_0323-Edit" src="http://blog.lesterpickerphoto.com/wp-content/uploads/2011/11/2011-11-Zion_0323-Edit.jpg" alt="" width="768" height="1024"></a></p>

<p>For my visit to Zion National Park in Utah I decided to take ONLY my Hassy system so that I would not fall back on my trusty Nikons if I felt frustrated by unfamiliar Hassy controls. It turns out that was a good decision, because I had many frustrations during the week-long adventure. Of course I’ve been shooting Nikon for 40 years, so I naturally had some readjusting to do.</p>

<p><a href="http://blog.lesterpickerphoto.com/wp-content/uploads/2011/11/2011-11-Zion_B_16822-Edit-Edit-Edit.jpg"><img class="size-full wp-image-1782" title="2011-11-Zion_B_16822-Edit-Edit-Edit" src="http://blog.lesterpickerphoto.com/wp-content/uploads/2011/11/2011-11-Zion_B_16822-Edit-Edit-Edit.jpg" alt="" width="1024" height="768"></a></p>

<p>I took along my Hassy body, along with the following Hassy lenses: 50-110mm, 120mm macro, 80mm, and 28mm. In medium format the lenses produce an image equivalent to 25% shorter in 35mm format, so that the 28mm, for example, equals a 22mm field of coverage. I packed all this gear into a LowePro Trekker 400AW backpack, which is one workhorse of a backpack (see my review on the LowePro in an upcoming blog).</p>

<p>Here’s what I learned from my experience. First, the Hassy equipment is heavy to trek, mostly due to two of my lenses. In the future I will most definitely leave my 120mm macro home unless I plan to spend the day emphasizing macro shots, in which case I’ll probably leave the 50-110 home. Both lenses weigh in at a whopping 4.5 pounds.</p>

<p><a href="http://blog.lesterpickerphoto.com/wp-content/uploads/2011/11/images.jpeg"><img class="size-full wp-image-1784 " title="images" src="http://blog.lesterpickerphoto.com/wp-content/uploads/2011/11/images.jpeg" alt="" width="303" height="166"></a></p>

<p>Jumping ahead, the bottom line is that I absolutely love the images the Hassy produced on this trip. The dynamic range is tremendous, far broader than what I’m used to on my Nikons, and the tonality (actually, the tonal gradation) is nothing short of sweet. The files have an almost film-like quality to them. And, they are huge. Given that I love the results, I’m willing to put up with what I see as its flaws for a landscape/travel photographer.</p>

<p><a href="http://blog.lesterpickerphoto.com/wp-content/uploads/2011/11/2011-11-Zion_A_16893-Edit.jpg"><img class="size-full wp-image-1786" title="2011-11-Zion_A_16893-Edit" src="http://blog.lesterpickerphoto.com/wp-content/uploads/2011/11/2011-11-Zion_A_16893-Edit.jpg" alt="" width="1024" height="768"></a></p>

<h3>Pluses and Minuses</h3>


<p>First, some additional pluses. The camera-lens combo, while heavy, has a solid, organic feel in my hand. The handle also serves as the battery and its rubbery grip is secure and comfortable. I do most of my work on a tripod, so this was a secondary benefit to me.</p>

<p>A more immediate plus is the bright, large viewfinder that gave me clear views even in low light situations. The shutter gives a resounding, positive response. Mirror lock-up is easy, once I programmed one of the buttons for that function.</p>

<p>On the other hand, the rechargeable batteries do not come close to Nikon’s batteries in terms of usage. I used to be able to go an entire day on a Nikon battery. With my Hassy, I went through 3 batteries on a couple of days and two batteries on others. I’ll have to buy another battery just to play safe, but at $200+ each that’s painful.</p>

<p>The H4D-50 only offers Live View (what they call Live Video) while tethered to a computer. That’s obviously of no use to a landscape photographer. Hassy needs to up its game and offer us untethered live view to allow for critical focusing, especially while using its tilt-shift mechanism with closeups or when placing foreground elements into a scenic.</p>

<p><a href="http://blog.lesterpickerphoto.com/wp-content/uploads/2011/11/2011-11-Zion_0317-Edit.jpg"><img class="size-full wp-image-1787" title="2011-11-Zion_0317-Edit" src="http://blog.lesterpickerphoto.com/wp-content/uploads/2011/11/2011-11-Zion_0317-Edit.jpg" alt="" width="768" height="1024"></a></p>

<p>Probably the biggest issue I had with my Hassy in the field is that it only has one auto-focus point, dead center in the frame. That’s no problem for fashion shooters, because most of them shoot hand-held. You aim, focus and recompose. Simple. Hassy does offer an innovative feature called True Focus. You focus on your subject and hold the True Focus button. Then, as you recompose, the camera uses its built-in gyroscopes to compensate for the change in angle, resulting in ultra-precise focusing capability. Very cool.</p>

<p>Most of my landscapes are shot on a tripod, where it’s inconvenient to focus, hold the button, fiddle with the tripod ball head controls, retighten, and shoot. Hassy needs to add focus points to its features list if they want to capture more of the outdoor market.</p>

<p><a href="http://blog.lesterpickerphoto.com/wp-content/uploads/2011/11/2011-11-Zion_A_17103-Edit-Edit.jpg"><img class="size-full wp-image-1788" title="2011-11-Zion_A_17103-Edit-Edit" src="http://blog.lesterpickerphoto.com/wp-content/uploads/2011/11/2011-11-Zion_A_17103-Edit-Edit.jpg" alt="" width="768" height="1024"></a></p>

<p>One quirk that I should mention is that the Hassy does not offer noise reduction in camera. That’s good in the sense that your image pops up in the viewfinder immediately after the mirror flips back. The bad news is that images shot in very low light or with long exposures show up with red, green and blue dots on the LCD screen after the shot is taken. Not to worry, though. When imported into Phocus (or Lightroom) the dots disappear due to the software’s inherent noise reduction.</p>

<p><a href="http://blog.lesterpickerphoto.com/wp-content/uploads/2011/11/2011-11-Zion_A_17370-Edit.jpg"><img class="size-full wp-image-1789" title="2011-11-Zion_A_17370-Edit" src="http://blog.lesterpickerphoto.com/wp-content/uploads/2011/11/2011-11-Zion_A_17370-Edit.jpg" alt="" width="1024" height="768"></a></p>

<p>So, all in all, I’m very satisfied with my Hasselblad and the stunning images it produces. After all, isn’t that what photography is about? I can put up with some inconvenience if the end result is an image I can take pride in.</p>

<p>As always, I welcome comments and critiques of my images.</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>I’ve been a bit spotty blogging lately, but lots has been happening on my side of the screen. Perhaps even too much. Managing a photography business isn’t easy in today’s world, especially with the high degree of travel that landscape/nature/travel photography entails. While I’m away things tend to pile up.</p>

<p>I guess the biggest thing to report is that due to the addition of a Hasselblad system, in addition to my Nikon system, I have had to make major changes to my workflow. The biggest news is that I am in the midst of converting from Aperture 3 to Lightroom 3 for my post-processing.</p>

<p><a href="http://blog.lesterpickerphoto.com/wp-content/uploads/2011/11/lightroom3.jpg"><img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-1777" title="lightroom3" src="http://blog.lesterpickerphoto.com/wp-content/uploads/2011/11/lightroom3.jpg" alt="" width="500" height="500"></a></p>

<p>This comes as a shock to some of my followers, since I’ve been an Aperture advocate for years. It’s an exemplary post-processing program and has served me well. Hasselblad has its own processing system, called Phocus, and it is a good program for certain tasks. It interprets the Hassy raw files particularly well, much as NX2 does for Nikon’s raw files. But Lightroom is more sophisticated and handles a broad range of post-processing tasks. My associate, Bob Boyer, and I have tested Lightroom 3 and find it handles the Hassy and Nikon files excellently.</p>

<p>Aperture distinguishes itself in its organizational abilities. Frankly, I have never used its highly sophisticated organization to its fullest. Lightroom 3 seems to follow my workflow a bit more organically. So far I like it.</p>

<p>Frankly, I don’t do a whole lot of post-processing work. I intentionally shoot with the most neutral settings possible, as I do not want the camera to make decisions for me. That usually means that I have to tweak saturation, contrast and, of course, add sharpening, depending on my output. I always seem to have dust on my sensor or water vapor on my lens, so I all too often have to clear them up. I might crop here or there, but that’s about it. I have never bothered to learn PhotoShop, so I can’t even envision all the manipulations I could do to an image.</p>

<p>Unfortunately, the switch to Lightroom also entails a change in my backup routine, and Bob and I are in the midst of that process right now. As always, I’ll keep you posted on my post-processing software changes. In the meantime, if any of you have had experience changing from Aperture to Lightroom, I appreciate you sharing your story with us.</p>

<p>Thanks and happy shooting!</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>Let&#8217;s admit it, we&#8217;re now in one of photography&#8217;s seasonal doldrums. Fall foliage is over, the trees are bare and snow has not hit much of the area, at least not in the mid-Atlantic, USA, region. This is the perfect time for checking out new equipment, innovative techniques, even changes in attitude toward whatever area of photography you have up to now avoided. In my sporadic &#8220;Homework&#8221; series (use the search box to find others), I&#8217;d like to add the perfect assignment for that rainy Saturday morning.</p>

<h3>Depth of Field</h3>


<p>Manipulating depth of field is an important tool in your photographic toolbox. Some photographers have a hard time visioning its effects when they are actually in the field photographing. Most photographers, if they use bracketing at all, will bracket up and down a stop to get the correct exposure, but how many of you also bracket to experiment with depth of field?</p>

<p>Again, on a snowy or rainy day, take out your camera and mount it on a tripod. You can do this with a hand-held camera, but it works better using a tripod. Get a yardstick or a tape measure and lay it out on a table. Now stand up a folded playing card (actually, almost any object will do) at the zero point and a couple of inches left or right of the ruler. Take 4 or 5 other cards and place them at 3-inch intervals behind the first card, staggering them closer and closer to the ruler.</p>

<p>Set up your camera-tripod at eye level to the cards. Switch to Aperture-Priority. Focus on the very first card. Starting with f2.8, and without moving your setup, take a photo at each successive f-stop (i.e.: 2.8, 4, 5.6, 8, 11, 16, 22). You may need a cable release to prevent camera shake. Now enlarge the images in-camera or transfer them to your computer to learn from them.</p>

<p>This is also the perfect time of year to conduct this experiment outdoors, since trees are bare of leaves. In a forested area, set up near a tree that has lots of other trees in the background. Shoot as explained above and note the results. This will give you a good idea of how depth of field affects an image&#8217;s mood and presentation. Do you want to blur the background to achieve your desired effect of isolating your subject? Or, do you want a rich, detailed image that shows clear focus from front to back. The more you experiment with depth of field, the better you will become at pre-visualzing its effects on your photography.</p>

<p>In the following image, I was attracted to this tree that somehow managed to flourish in such a precarious environment, growing from cracks in the rock poised near the edge of the Grand Canyon. I pre-visualized the image I wanted and knew that if I shot wide open, meaning at f/2.8, 4 or 5.6, the background would render blurry and unrecognizable. So I shot at f/11 and 16, as shown here. I like the effect of placing the gnarled tree in the context of its magnificent setting.</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>First the good news. My thumb surgery appears as if it is heading for success. My cast came off, my Physical Therapy in Sue&#8217;s capable hands is going well. While in Zion National Park I was able to use my left hand to support my heavy Hasselblad camera-zoom lens combinations with just a little soreness by day&#8217;s end. So, there&#8217;s much to be grateful for in that arena.</p>

<p>The bad news is that I ran into some viral bug on Monday and by Tuesday it had me laid low. Apparently this has been making the rounds in my part of the country, according to my internist. Severe sore throat, coughing, headache, chills, but no fever. My throat was painfully sore for 4 days. Today is my first day back on the job, but subpar is still the operative word.</p>

<p>This week I will post my first review of my Hasselblad H4D-50, so any of you medium format folks may want to check in for that.</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>I’m sitting on the deck of my motel room in Zion National Park. Thankfully, I was able to recover from my back spasm within 48 hours and so rebooked my flight and arrived two days late, just grateful to be here. After a day of photographing the gorgeous scenery, I fell ill to altitude sickness and dehydration, two maladies to which I have always been susceptible. Headache, vertigo, yuckiness. So my morning was spent in bed, trying to make believe that there is an alternative reality somewhere in space and time, one where I was happily traipsing through the fall leaves.</p>

<p>I recovered enough in late afternoon to venture out for some sunset images, but by time we got organized we had missed the opportunity. So we had dinner, reconnoitered and went for a nighttime shoot at Canyon Overlook. The moon is nearly full tonight, so we thought it would be a great place. The hike was invigorating, but downright dangerous in places. Most drop-offs were protected by rails, but not all. But the night was still and crisp and the moon cast an ethereal glow over the entire valley. Here is a short video clip of my photo buddy, Daniel Stainer, at one of the overlook bridges.</p>

<p><a title="Canyon Overlook at Night" href="http://youtu.be/9QJuRYGYaig">http://youtu.be/9QJuRYGYaig </a></p>

<p>Since I’ve not been to Zion National Park before, I was really looking forward to this visit. I’m using this visit to field test my new Hasselblad H4D-50. In fact, I left all my Nikon equipment at home so this was a cold turkey test. No alternate reality option available.</p>

<p><a href="http://blog.lesterpickerphoto.com/wp-content/uploads/2011/11/Job_0142-1.jpg"><img class="size-full wp-image-1758" title="Job_0142 (1)" src="http://blog.lesterpickerphoto.com/wp-content/uploads/2011/11/Job_0142-1.jpg" alt="" width="480" height="640"></a></p>

<p>I also bought a new backpack for the trip, a LowePro Trekker 400 AW, as my Hassy equipment is bulkier than my Nikon gear. I’ll review the backpack and explain more about this Hassy test in a coming blog, where I’ll summarize what I see as strengths and weaknesses of the Hassy system for landscape and nature photographers. Very briefly, the files the Hassy system produces seem incredible to my eyes, but there are definite “issues” with using it in the field. Some of them are undoubtedly due to my stubbornness and to my intricate knowledge of Nikon products. It’s hard to teach an old dog new tricks.</p>

<p>For now, here are some impressions of Zion NP. Keep in mind that I am visiting after the high summer season, so I did not experience the legendary crowds and forced shuttle bus system that prevails in summer. Instead, every manner of photographic workshop seems to be in progress right now. Few of the iconic sites were free of photographers. That meant that Dan Stainer and I had to hike to locations where we would have fewer crowds, although according to the locals, “crowds” is a highly subjective word.</p>

<p>Zion NP is drop-dead gorgeous at this time of year. At the far northern end of the park, near Colob Canyon, the leaves have already changed, so we were presented with snow-flecked mountains amidst golden sunsets. Farther south, in Springdale, near the main entrance to the park, the yellows and reds of autumn are just now putting on their show.</p>

<p>I spent an afternoon hiking in the Checkerboard Mesa section of the park. Here is a short video of the area I was in. The rock formations here are wonderful to behold, eye candy wherever you look.</p>

<p><a title="Checkerboard Mesa area" href="http://youtu.be/aO7PcIoN3IY">http://youtu.be/aO7PcIoN3IY</a></p>

<p>Hope you all have a wonderful weekend!</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>What a bummer! Instead of leaving for Zion National Park for a glorious week of photography, I&#8217;m on the couch, alternating between a heating pad and ice packs, along with doses of muscle relaxants and pain killers. Yesterday evening I pulled my back out, but thought it was minor. When I woke up, ready to go to the airport, I couldn&#8217;t even walk. My back had spasmed and I was in pretty extreme pain.</p>

<p><a href="http://blog.lesterpickerphoto.com/wp-content/uploads/2011/11/photo.jpg"><img class="size-full wp-image-1754" title="photo" src="http://blog.lesterpickerphoto.com/wp-content/uploads/2011/11/photo.jpg" alt="" width="640" height="480"></a></p>

<p>Tonight I feel considerably better, so I&#8217;m in hopes that I&#8217;ll just be delayed a couple of days and will be able to join my buddy, Dan Stainer, by Tuesday. I&#8217;ve been looking forward to this trip and the chance to truly field test my Hasselblad system. But that entails me carting around a 30-lb backpack, so I guess I&#8217;ll just have to heal first.</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>If you wonder what the state of photography is and where it is headed, PhotoPlus was the place to be last week. The annual show was held at the Jacob Javits convention center in New York City. It was not just huge, it was mammoth. Vendors of every major camera brand had large, walk-through display booths. Accessory makers had tables or even, in some cases, display booths themselves. Thousands of people streamed through the show.</p>

<p><a href="http://blog.lesterpickerphoto.com/wp-content/uploads/2011/11/Unknown.jpeg"><img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-1744" title="Unknown" src="http://blog.lesterpickerphoto.com/wp-content/uploads/2011/11/Unknown.jpeg" alt="" width="160" height="64"></a></p>

<p><a href="http://blog.lesterpickerphoto.com/wp-content/uploads/2011/11/Unknown.jpeg"></a>There were several developments that impressed me. Of course, digital photography will continue to evolve, much to the consternation of pros, myself included, who see these cameras as supplanting some (but thankfully not all) of our work. What has happened is that our experience, with matters like controlling dynamic range, focus control and others, are now being reduced to masterful algorithms that are handled by the camera’s onboard computers. When people complain to me about the cost of these new engineering marvels I have to smile.</p>

<p>What impressed me the most was how the accessory market has evolved. I spent most of my convention floor time handling the new, sensuous print papers that have come on market. Classic names like Ilford, Museo, Hahnemuhle are producing incredible papers that bring out the best of inkjet printers. But newer names like Canson and Awagami Factory have luscious products that wowed me. Needless to say my associate Bob and I will be doing a lot of experimenting this year.</p>

<p>We also spent lots of time at Hasselblad’s offsite facility, where I was again wowed by customer service and value-added workshops and discussions that continue to help me climb the learning curve for using my new H4D-50 camera and lenses in creative ways. So far I have to tell you that I am so impressed with Hasselblad’s ability to handle dynamic range and interpret it in almost a film-like manner. I’ll be blogging a lot about that in the future as I share successes and failures.</p>

<p>A few “wins” from PhotoPlus. I was able to connect in person with a Nikon technician named Jim Crawley who has worked for Nikon for 46 years! Jim knew my Uncle Morris, who was an independent, but legendary Nikon repairman himself. My uncle has been dead for many years now, so it was a real treat for me to make the connection. A funny story is that I had a colleague who I taught with at the University of Delaware in the eighties. His old mechanical Nikon broke and he sent it in for repair. They sent him a message saying that they could not repair it, but there was a man in New York City who could. You bet; it was my Uncle Morris!</p>

<p>I also got to connect with people who I deal with regularly, but who up to now were email addresses or an anonymous phone voice. I’m the kind of person who appreciates face-to-face, having grown up in the pre-Internet world.</p>

<p>Final observation is about equipment versus technique. Throughout the convention hall, exhibitors set up mini-theaters for their guest lecturers. Nikon had live models for people to try out their equipment. I was impressed by how well attended these demonstrations, lectures, workshops and live shoots were. Here is a video clip of the Nikon exhibit showing people watching a live demonstration.</p>

<p>http://youtu.be/YxYUZTrlJDI</p>

<p>People are obviously eager for ways to improve their photography, to better express themselves creatively in a world that stresses uniformity. My hat is off to all those who were there to learn.</p>

<p>If you are a photo enthusiast, think about attending one of these shows. I know you will get a lot out of it.</p>
