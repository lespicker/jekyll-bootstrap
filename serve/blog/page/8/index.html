  <div class="entry-content"><p>It&#8217;s the end of another spectacular Fall Maine Nikonians workshop. Frankly, I&#8217;m sorry to see it end. Coastal Maine in the Fall is a joy that every landscape and travel photographer should experience. There are, of course, the quintessential rocky coast images to be captured, but there are also the birch forests, tree-lined ponds, bogs, waterfalls, lighthouses, and thick-cushioned, undulating moss that fluoresces in the rain or fog. There are quiet, picturesque villages like Somesville, and hard working lobstermen and women in their colorful boats in towns like Southwest Harbor, Bass Harbor or Bernard.</p>

<p><a href="http://blog.lesterpickerphoto.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/10/monument-cove.jpg"><img class="size-medium wp-image-2397" title="monument cove" src="http://blog.lesterpickerphoto.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/10/monument-cove-300x225.jpg" alt="" width="300" height="225"></a></p>

<p>I&#8217;ve often said that Mt. Desert Island, where the epicenter of Acadia National Park is located, has more photo opps per square meter than any other place on earth. Drop a pin anywhere in Acadia and if you can&#8217;t spend the rest of the day photographing within 100 yards of that pin, call your optometrist.</p>

<p>This year&#8217;s workshop was fully subscribed, although a few days before we began one of the participants had to drop out due to a family emergency. I like to limit my workshops to ten or fewer people, depending on the location, so each participant can feel comfortable asking me for help or advice.</p>

<p>This year our group gelled from the moment we met. Coming from as far away as Texas, we shared, critiqued, laughed and shot sunrises, sunsets and all sorts of scenics in between. We even elected to have dinner together each night, sharing our daily adventures over good food, micro-brew beers and good wines.</p>

<p><a href="http://blog.lesterpickerphoto.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/10/workshop-discussion.jpg"><img class="size-medium wp-image-2401" title="workshop-discussion" src="http://blog.lesterpickerphoto.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/10/workshop-discussion-300x225.jpg" alt="" width="300" height="225"></a></p>

<p>When all is said and done I want to tip my hat to my workshoppers. Not only did I enjoy their company, but I learned some things myself. I was so impressed by the positive attitude, the collegiality, and the dedication these folks exhibited to their avocation. They are a passionate group, eager to learn and use new skills to improve their self-expression through photography. I made nine wonderful friends over the past four days. Hats off to you fine folks!</p>

<p>Next year&#8217;s workshops in Acadia will be posted soon on the <a href="http://www.nikoniansacademy.com/all/viewWorkshop.html?workshop_id=107">Nikonians website</a>. Check there for details.</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>This morning my Maine photo workshop group that I teach for Nikonians woke up to torrential rains. So our morning field trip was cancelled and instead we had a wonderful 3-hour discussion session, covering lots of photographic concepts.</p>

<p><a href="http://blog.lesterpickerphoto.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/10/image.jpeg"><img class="size-medium wp-image-2393" title="image" src="http://blog.lesterpickerphoto.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/10/image-300x225.jpeg" alt="" width="300" height="225"></a></p>

<p>Personally, I love these jam sessions, with no preconceived agenda. Instead, having lived with each other for 36 hours already, shooting all around spectacular Mt. Desert Island, questions have arisen, new types of equipment seen, new techniques observed. So the morning was spent sharing with each other terrific photo tips and suggestions.</p>

<p>I particularly enjoy these sessions because I learn so much from these passionate, committed folks. Today I found out about some new software, and picked up a tripod tip, for example. Judging from the reaction of the participants, I think they appreciated the down down, the sharing, and the chance to pick up tips from a working pro.</p>

<p>Now I&#8217;m busily scarfing down some lunch because the rain is easing and we&#8217;re out to photograph an eye candy moss forest and then hike to a waterfall.</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>My 2012 Maine photography workshop has just begun and already we are being treated to Mother Nature&#8217;s Fall Spectacular. Since I got up for a sunrise shoot and it&#8217;s not almost 11:00PM and I have another sunrise shoot tomorrow, this will have to be short.</p>

<p><a href="http://blog.lesterpickerphoto.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/10/A0022832.jpg"><img class="size-medium wp-image-2389" title="A0022832" src="http://blog.lesterpickerphoto.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/10/A0022832-300x225.jpg" alt="" width="300" height="225"></a></p>

<p> </p>

<p>My wife and I were driving past North East Harbor on Mt. Desert Island, doing a last minute check on sites where I plan on taking my workshop participants, when the pond scene at the Asticou Azalea Gardens reached out and grabbed us. This is an unretouched photo straight out of my camera (Hasselblad H4D-50).</p>

<p>I also scouted out the iconic Bass Harbor Light last night and here&#8217;s what I walked away with. There were probably a dozen other photographers scoping out the historic lighthouse and we had lots of laughs as the cameras whirred into motion.</p>

<p><a href="http://blog.lesterpickerphoto.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/10/A0022773.jpg"><img class="size-medium wp-image-2390" title="A0022773" src="http://blog.lesterpickerphoto.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/10/A0022773-225x300.jpg" alt="" width="225" height="300"></a></p>

<p>My workshop participants arrived just before dinner and we scurried over to Jordan Pond for a quick shoot Tomorrow is a big day, starting with sunrise at Sand Beach in Acadia National Park. I&#8217;ll keep you posted as the next four days go by.</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>One could make a strong case for my professional schizophrenia. On the one hand I am a professional landscape/nature photographer. But that&#8217;s only half of what I do. I&#8217;ve also <a href="http://blog.lesterpickerphoto.com/about-2/">written nonfiction</a> extensively, for dozens of national magazines and newspapers over the years. Yet, one of my lifelong goals has been to write fiction.</p>

<p>So, play the fanfare. I&#8217;m excited to tell you all that this past week I published two of the historical fiction novels that I have been working on for the past several years. With the collapse of the tree-killing publishers over the past few years, my literary agent and I decided that the best approach right now is for me to publish these first two books as e-books and also make them available as paperbacks through <a href="http://www.amazon.com/Lester-Picker/e/B009E6U9R0/ref=sr_tc_2_0?qid=1348945748&amp;sr=1-2-ent://">Amazon</a>.</p>

<p><a href="http://blog.lesterpickerphoto.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/10/The-First-Pharaoh-Ebook.jpg"><img class="alignnone size-medium wp-image-2380" title="The First Pharaoh Ebook" src="http://blog.lesterpickerphoto.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/10/The-First-Pharaoh-Ebook-192x300.jpg" alt="" width="192" height="300"></a></p>

<p>The lead book in my First Dynasty Series is called <em>The First Pharaoh</em>. It tells the story of King Narmer, who united Upper and Lower Egypt under one rule and created an enduring civilization that lasted for 3,000 years. The book is told through the eyes of Anhotek, King Narmer&#8217;s vizier and shaman. We follow Narmer&#8217;s birth, his loves, the battles he fought to unite Egypt, and the intrigue surrounding his enemies within the Royal Court.</p>

<p><a href="http://blog.lesterpickerphoto.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/10/The-Dagger-of-Isis-EBook-HR.jpg"><img class="alignnone size-medium wp-image-2381" title="The Dagger of Isis EBook HR" src="http://blog.lesterpickerphoto.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/10/The-Dagger-of-Isis-EBook-HR-192x300.jpg" alt="" width="192" height="300"></a></p>

<p>The sequel, <em>The Dagger of Isis</em>, tells what could arguably be called an even more amazing story; the rise to power of the very first female King, Narmer&#8217;s great-granddaughter. After the tragic death of her husband, Meryt-Neith overcomes the schemes of her cousin to lead the nation as regent for her son. The real-life Meryt-Neith ruled for 17 years, and my novel follows her rise to power, the wars she fought, as well as her struggles to maintain the fragile peace.</p>

<p>The third and final book in the series will be published in 2013. If I tell you what it is about I&#8217;ll have to send an undercover Apep priest to cast evil spells on you.</p>

<p>I do hope you&#8217;ll consider <a href="http://www.amazon.com/Lester-Picker/e/B009E6U9R0/ref=sr_tc_2_0?qid=1348945748&amp;sr=1-2-ent">reading these novels</a>. If you do, please give other readers your reaction on the Amazon site. I take my readers&#8217; comments seriously and love to correspond and answer questions about my books. For background information about the books, how I came to write them, Frequently Asked Questions, and more, please visit my writing website: <a href="http://www.lesterpicker.com">www.lesterpicker.com</a>.</p>

<p> </p>

<p>Thanks in advance!</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>For that one very special person who has time available, one slot has opened for my previously fully-booked photography workshop in Maine. The 4-day event begins on October 18 at 3:00 PM and ends on October 22 at noon. If there is any one place I look forward to being it is in Maine during Mother Nature&#8217;s display of Fall foliage. Even better, the workshop takes place in Acadia National Park, right on the coast. Acadia is a jewel, no doubt about that.</p>

<p><a href="http://blog.lesterpickerphoto.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/10/LAP8318.jpg"><img src="http://blog.lesterpickerphoto.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/10/LAP8318-300x199.jpg" alt="" title="_LAP8318" width="300" height="199" class="alignnone size-medium wp-image-2374"></a></p>

<p>We will spend four intense days shooting from sunrise to sunset, including forest, rocky coast, beach and mountain. This Nikonians workshop is open to anyone, regardless of ability level, camera, or knowledge. Come to learn! Come to share! Come to experience!</p>

<p><a href="http://blog.lesterpickerphoto.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/10/Maine-2009-longpond1.jpg"><img src="http://blog.lesterpickerphoto.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/10/Maine-2009-longpond1-199x300.jpg" alt="" title="Maine 2009-longpond1" width="199" height="300" class="alignnone size-medium wp-image-2375"></a></p>

<p>If you are interested <a href="http://www.nikoniansacademy.com/all/viewWorkshop.html?workshop_id=107">here&#8217;s the link to the course</a>. But, register quickly. There is only one spot left (due to an unfortunate medical situation). I look forward to seeing you there!</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>Whether you&#8217;re a professional or amateur photographer, you should consider what your &#8220;brand&#8221; is all about. How do you want your audience to view you and your work? What image are you trying to project? Think hard about this branding stuff because it is critical for your success.</p>

<p>As a professional myself, my assistant and I have long discussions (and even arguments) when it comes to branding our work. Both of us are perfectionists when it comes to how my images look. But what I think largely sets us apart from our competition is that we give the same attention to how we present our work as I do in capturing every image.</p>

<p>I readily admit that I am blessed with an assistant as smart, diligent and experienced as Bob (Boyer). The fact that we both care about our &#8220;brand&#8221; is a bonus. If there is a flaw in one of our images, it does not leave our shop. Period.</p>

<p>But branding goes much farther than that for us. We are a high-end photographic business. I do editorial photography, but my work also hangs in major hospitals, offices, private homes and, occasionally, galleries. I want to be sure that everything that showcases my work is as thoughtfully done as the images themselves. We agonize over traditional framing options. Our face-mounted plexi images use nothing but the very best green-edged treatments and we add an architectural element to the mounting. We custom print our wall coverings ourselves in our shop so that they meet our exacting standards.</p>

<h3>Crazy Branding</h3>


<p>One recent example of how crazy this branding can get involves a gallery show that we did a few months ago, for which we printed several of my Limited Edition prints. These 30&#8221; x 40&#8221; prints, whether framed for unframed, are a significant investment, so we had long discussions over a seemingly petty thing like the Certificate of Authenticity (COA) that is transferred to the collector with the sale.</p>

<p>Most photographers have fairly large print runs for their Limited Edition images, perhaps 50, 100 or more and there is nothing wrong with that business model. For our part, we only do print runs of 10 or 25 (inclusive of all sizes). We believe that adds value to my art images, which are usually printed on Museo archival art papers in our studio, using our Epson 9900 with HDR UltraChrome Inks. So, these luscious prints are made to last 100 or more years.</p>

<p>Most COAs- and I have to be blunt here- look like they were created by 5th graders. Busy photographers simply pluck them off the Internet, maybe tinker with it a bit to personalize it, and then print it out and sign it. That flew in the face of our branding. We wanted our COA to perfectly match the high-end nature of our Limited Editions.</p>

<p>We went into design mode and over a period of two weeks we fidgeted and fussed until we had achieved what we were looking for. Our COA is not only &#8220;smart-looking&#8221; (a client&#8217;s words), but functional. It has three different security features that truly guarantee authenticity and would be very hard to forge (although no one in his right mind would attempt to forge my crappy signature!).</p>

<p><a href="http://blog.lesterpickerphoto.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/09/DSC_3582.jpeg"><img class="size-medium wp-image-2370" title="DSC_3582" src="http://blog.lesterpickerphoto.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/09/DSC_3582-300x200.jpeg" alt="" width="300" height="200"></a></p>

<p>Our COA is printed on top-end vellum paper. It includes a matching image, a description of the image and a brief on the paper and ink. The number of prints in the series is lightly screened across the bottom of the page. Our company logo is printed in two colors, and on the reverse side is a black security stripe that indicates the number of the print in the series. The final touch is a security holographic stamp over which I sign my name.</p>

<p>Over the top? Perhaps. But then again, that is what we want our clients to experience with each of our products. That&#8217;s our brand.</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>So, it&#8217;s been about a week since my last post, a bit unusual for me. As you&#8217;ll see, I&#8217;ve been more than a bit busy as we prepare for the grand opening of the Neurological Rehabilitation Center at Sinai Hospital in Baltimore. My imagery is featured exclusively throughout the unit. That&#8217;s no small matter when we&#8217;re talking more than 50 images, some as much as 30 feet in width!</p>

<p>About ten days ago my installers put up all the wall covering images.</p>

<p><a href="http://blog.lesterpickerphoto.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/09/DSCF4507.jpg"><img src="http://blog.lesterpickerphoto.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/09/DSCF4507-300x199.jpg" alt="" title="DSCF4507" width="300" height="199" class="size-medium wp-image-2366"></a></p>

<p>I thought it would be fun to show you the main graphic going up. My assistant, Bob, compressed about two hours of work into <a title="Hanging Wall Covering" href="http://vimeo.com/49613056">one 60-second video</a> that we filmed (can we say that with video?) using my Nikon D800 and Bob&#8217;s Nikon D7000, both mounted on tripods.</p>

<p>It was a stressful day, with having to hang a 30-feet, 19-feet, 17-feet and assorted 10-feet and 4-feet walls. But our installers are super-pros and did a great job. Hats off to Robin, Sean and Bill!</p>

<p> </p>

For those of you who are curious, here is the file from which we created the wall covering.</p>

<p><a href="http://blog.lesterpickerphoto.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/09/harbor-flat-small1.jpg"><img class="size-medium wp-image-2360" title="Baltimore harbor" src="http://blog.lesterpickerphoto.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/09/harbor-flat-small1-300x89.jpg" alt="" width="300" height="89"></a></p>

<p>In the video you may notice that one of the panels is a bit &#8220;off&#8221; in terms of color and shading. We ended up having to rush back to our studio late at night, reprint the 9-foot strip, coat it with sealer, and have it back bright and early the next morning for our people to install it. Stuff happens!</p>

<p>BTW, I took this pano using 11 or so images across the bottom and the same number along the top, with my Nikon D800 and a 200-400mm lens set at 300mm.

  <div class="entry-content"><p>In <a href="http://blog.lesterpickerphoto.com/2012/08/21/panoramas-nail-your-nodal-points/">Part 1</a> of this 2-part series on panoramas, I discussed the role of nodal points in nailing top-notch panoramas. For a long time I didn&#8217;t bother with nodal points and that caused me a lot of extra post-processing time. In fact, on several occasions it meant that I had to throw out a pano that I had painstakingly tried to capture. That can easily happen if you do a pano with a looming foreground object and have not set your nodal point.</p>

<p>So, with my nodal points now set and printed on a card that I laminate and take with me, I&#8217;m off to the races.</p>

<p><a href="http://blog.lesterpickerphoto.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/09/nodalcard.jpg"><img class="size-medium wp-image-2340" title="nodalcard" src="http://blog.lesterpickerphoto.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/09/nodalcard-300x225.jpg" alt="" width="300" height="225"></a></p>

<p> </p>

<h3>The Setup</h3>


<p>When I&#8217;m on site I get out all my gear and set up. If I&#8217;m shooting a horizontal scene, I put my camera in vertical orientation. Vice versa if I plan to shoot a tall waterfall or vertical cityscape.</p>

<p>Next, assuming I have framed the scene I want, I first level my tripod. I&#8217;m thinking of buying a tripod leveling attachment for my ballhead, but so far in my career I have managed with just leveling my tripod by adjusting its legs and then re-leveling if I have to move it. That can get tedious pretty fast.</p>

<p>Once leveled I mount my chosen camera and lens onto the nodal slide attachment I own (<a href="http://www.reallyrightstuff.com">Really Right Stuff</a>). In turn I place this entire setup on the tripod. Now I level the nodal slide/camera unit. I also check to be sure that I have the lens positioned correctly on the slide to avoid parallax problems (that&#8217;s the nodal point). I always use a cable release for my tripod work and panos are no exception.</p>

<p>Now I pan right and left (or up and down if I&#8217;m shooting a vertical panorama). So far, so good, because if it isn&#8217;t that means I may have to move my tripod and level it again.</p>

<p>I put all my camera settings on manual. I focus, pan and focus again to get it right. I get my exposure settings where I want them. I fiddle with my graduated neutral density filters to adjust the dynamic range to where I like it. I may take a few test pictures to calibrate exposure.</p>

<p>Next I figure out how much overlap I want in the images. Typically I like a 30% overlap, although 20% will also work. It is entirely possible to just eyeball this overlap, but I usually resort to using the gradations on my ballhead for greater precision.</p>

<h3>Shooting Panos At Night</h3>


<p>There is one thing I want to mention about that panning process. If you are panning a night scene, you would do better to use the gradations etched into your ballhead mount, since eyeballing it in the dark may not be accurate.</p>

<p><a href="http://blog.lesterpickerphoto.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/09/BH55LR.png"><img class="size-medium wp-image-2347" title="BH55LR" src="http://blog.lesterpickerphoto.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/09/BH55LR-300x300.png" alt="" width="300" height="300"></a></p>

<p>Of course using tiny gradation marks presents its own problem, since you don&#8217;t want to be accidentally shining a light from your headlamp into your lens at a critical moment. I use a headlamp with a red light just for security sake. At night I have a routine that goes something like this: focus and fiddle until right, close the back eyepiece window, flip up the mirror (to minimize camera shake), and I&#8217;m ready for the pano sequence. Press the cable release, switch on red headlamp, unlock ballhead rotation clamp, rotate ballhead x notches, turn off light, screw down ballhead rotation clamp, press cable release and repeat until the pano sequence is complete.</p>

<h3>Man on a Mission</h3>


<p>Once I start my pano I am like a man on mission. Don&#8217;t talk to me, don&#8217;t distract me, don&#8217;t even get too close to me! I am clicking, shifting, retightening, and shooting again. Once I&#8217;m done with the sequence, I breathe. In my defense, I feel it&#8217;s important to move quickly because of how fast light changes, clouds move, and trees sway.</p>

<p>I always shoot the pano again, maybe varying the exposure by 1/3 or 1/2 stop. There are also times when I&#8217;ll shoot 3 images at each stop, one properly exposed, one stop over and one under. That gives Bob Boyer, my Master Printmaker, a chance to fill in some of the shaded areas with a little light from the overexposed image(s).</p>

<h3>What is a Pano Anyway?</h3>


<p>There is also the issue of what constitutes a pano. I&#8217;m not one to shoot huge panos, although the one of the Baltimore Harbor shown here is a collection of 14 vertical images, the most I have ever done.</p>

<p><a href="http://blog.lesterpickerphoto.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/09/harbor-flat-small.jpg"><img class="size-medium wp-image-2341" title="harbor-flat-small" src="http://blog.lesterpickerphoto.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/09/harbor-flat-small-300x89.jpg" alt="" width="300" height="89"></a></p>

<p>In that case I needed it for a wall covering installation that spans 29 feet! I needed every pixel I was able to lasso to get a printed image that looks good. Some folks I know use the GigaPan device, which can shoot hundreds of images in a panorama. Since I shoot a Hasselblad in RAW and I have a 6-year old Mac computer, I&#8217;ll skip that technology for right now.</p>

<p>Most of the time I will take 3 images to build a pano. But, I&#8217;m also thinking of how I will use them. Sometimes, as with the Baltimore Harbor wall covering, I need something long and narrow. Other times I will need something nearly square for a client&#8217;s wall space (a 2-shot pano?). So, while I&#8217;m in a particular location, I&#8217;ll try various combos to afford me some flexibility.</p>

<p>I&#8217;m sure I&#8217;ve left some things out. As always, if you have any questions or wish to make a comment, feel free to do so here.</p>

<hr />

<p>I was alone in the Canadian Rockies, spending two glorious weeks photographing in one of my favorite places on Earth. This particular day dawned overcast and bone-chilling cold, the perfect day for a landscape photographer! I drove in and around Kananaskis National Park and I stopped for an energy bar breakfast on the shores of Spray Lake.</p>

<p>The clouds hung low and were moving fast, sure signs of an approaching storm. As I looked north down the lake, what caught my eye was the contrast between the crystal clear water, rocks and the impending storm. Yet, and here is where I was taken in, the sun was able to tinge the distant clouds with a touch of pink.</p>

<p>I ran back to my car to retrieve my waders and kneeled in the water to get the rocks in the foreground the way I wanted.</p>
