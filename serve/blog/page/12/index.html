  <div class="entry-content"><p>First, my apologies. I was supposed to announce the winner of our ScotteVest contest last month. Trouble is, I came back from Israel and had a 72-hour turnaround before I left for Sri Lanka for nearly a month, so in my haste I just totally forgot about the contest. An astute reader reminded me of my errant ways and so I&#8217;m writing today to announce the winner of a brand new Classic ScotteVest.</p>

<p>Meet Cate Crandell, who calls Kansas home. I&#8217;ll let her tell her own story:</p>

<p><a href="http://blog.lesterpickerphoto.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/04/photo1.jpg"><img class="size-full wp-image-2107" title="photo" src="http://blog.lesterpickerphoto.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/04/photo1.jpg" alt="" width="180" height="270"></a></p>

<p>&#8220;<em>My love for photography started when I was in high school, and it, coupled with my curiosity about teaching and experiencing cultures, eventually brought me to my current location in Moldova as a volunteer with the Peace Corps. This experience is soon coming to an end, and when it does I will be heading to India and Thailand for a month of photography. By August I hope to be in Austin or back in my hometown of Kansas City, beginning a new career in social marketing and community engagement, while of course always having my camera at my side and   jet setting as much as possible. While researching the best travel clothing for photographers, I was led to Les and his review of the ScotteVest. I cannot wait to try my own, and will of course review it on my blog (<a href="http://www.wherescate.blogspot.com/">www.wherescate.blogspot.com</a>)</em>.&#8221;</p>

<p>I wish Cate the very best and my hat is off to her for serving our country in such a positive way. I know she&#8217;ll love her ScotteVest, just as I love mine.</p>

<p>I also want to thank <a href="http://www.scottevest.com">ScotteVest</a> for sponsoring this contest for my loyal blog followers.</p>

<p>Cate&#8217;s name was chosen completely at random from those people who registered on my blog. If you want to be eligible for future product contests, please register on this blog site right now. It&#8217;s easy!</p>

<p>BTW, you can still &#8220;win&#8221; by using my discount code to save 15% on any ScotteVest product you want. Just go to the right side of the page and click on the discount code box. While I write a regular blog for ScotteVest, I do not make any money from these sales. Just thought you&#8217;d like to know.</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>I’m preparing to leave the lovely country of Sri Lanka after three weeks spent here. Located off the coast of India, with a population of some 21 million, the country is a tourist’s delight. Since the signing of the peace treaty with the terrorist Tamil Tigers two years ago, the country is now focused on developing its infrastructure, which is badly in need of repair (after driving its roads, my back is howling). Sri Lanka, formerly known as Ceylon, means “Pearl of the Indian Ocean” and, believe me, it lives up to its name.</p>

<p>Here, then, are some of my favorite and not so favorite aspects of Sri Lanka for those of you fortunate enough to consider coming here.</p>

<p><strong><em>The People</em></strong>. You will absolutely never find friendlier people anywhere you travel on this planet. As a primarily Buddhist nation, when you greet a person, hands together, you will receive a warm smile. Service in restaurants is fabulous. For photographers, the country is ideal, as nearly everyone agrees to have their photo taken.</p>

<p><a href="http://blog.lesterpickerphoto.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/04/DSC_2126.jpg"><img class="size-medium wp-image-2099" title="DSC_2126" src="http://blog.lesterpickerphoto.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/04/DSC_2126-300x200.jpg" alt="" width="300" height="200"></a></p>

<p><strong><em>Food</em></strong>. Sri Lanka offers a widely diverse menu. I would definitely recommend taking advantage of local foods, such as curries with various rices, all grown in-country. Since many Buddhists are primarily vegetarians, there is an abundance of fresh, colorful, delicious veggies.</p>

<p><strong><em>Photo Opps</em></strong>. Sri Lanka has got to be one of the most photogenic countries on earth, no exaggeration. First, the geography varies from lush mountains in the north to dry desert-like conditions in the south. Second, it has some of the most photographable architecture in the way of its temples and shrines. Third, its wildlife is exceptional, from monkeys to leopards and elephants. Fourth, its people are beautiful, both in looks and spirit, and nearly always willing to allow you to take their picture.</p>

<p><a href="http://blog.lesterpickerphoto.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/04/A0018633.jpg"><img class="size-medium wp-image-2103" title="A0018633" src="http://blog.lesterpickerphoto.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/04/A0018633-232x300.jpg" alt="" width="232" height="300"></a></p>

<p><strong><em>The Geography</em></strong>. In a day’s drive you can go from lush, tropical highlands where Sri Lanka’s finest tea plantations are located, to the forest and flat scrub brush country of Yala National Park. Bring a wide and medium length lens with you (a zoom works fine) and use a polarizer.</p>

<p><strong><em>The Culture</em></strong>. As a Buddhist nation the people have a very patient, gentle attitude toward life. They help each other out. They share their meals with homeless dogs. They support beggars. They go out of their way to cater to guests and are very humbled and contrite when they get it wrong. I celebrated the Buddhist New Year in the private home of a family and was made to feel like a welcomed friend.</p>

<p><strong><em>The Tea</em></strong>. I am an ardent tea drinker, having given up coffee more than 10 years ago. I love the subtle differences between teas. Sri Lanka makes some of the best teas in the world. I had the joy of visiting a tea plantation, as well as a tea factory. (“The coffee is terrible!” was the most common refrain at breakfasts). The tea growing region is just so gorgeous and you are guaranteed to see women picking every day, as Sri Lanka’s climate is ideal for growing the plants.</p>

<p><a href="http://blog.lesterpickerphoto.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/04/A0018845.jpg"><img class="size-medium wp-image-2100" title="A0018845" src="http://blog.lesterpickerphoto.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/04/A0018845-300x225.jpg" alt="" width="300" height="225"></a></p>

<p><strong><em>The Animals</em></strong>. Sri Lanka is a gold mine for animal lovers and photographers. There are several national parks that are home to Sri Lanka’s 6,000 elephants. <a href="http://blog.lesterpickerphoto.com/2012/04/14/sri-lanka%E2%80%99s-incredible-yala-national-park/">Yala National Park</a> is considered one of the top leopard environments on Earth. Bring a telephoto lens with you and a sturdy tripod or beanbag.</p>

<p><a href="http://blog.lesterpickerphoto.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/04/DSC_0307.jpg"><img class="size-medium wp-image-2101" title="DSC_0307" src="http://blog.lesterpickerphoto.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/04/DSC_0307-300x179.jpg" alt="" width="300" height="179"></a></p>

<p><strong><em>Massages</em></strong>. How can you resist a one-hour full body massage for $20-25 USD? Every hotel has Ayurvedic masseuses who will work their magic on those sore muscles.</p>

<p><strong><em>Learning</em></strong>. Sri Lankans are open and willing to share their knowledge and traditions. In fact, they welcome questions, although you may need an interpreter with you (English is now mandatory in schools). The learning extends to the Buddhist and Hindu temples, where people worship openly and where even the monks are eager to answer whatever questions you might have. The history of the nation and its unique architecture offers many learning opportunities. I love the cultural differences that define our behaviors. For one thing, Sri Lankans shake their heads from side to side, rather than up and down, when they mean “okay,” something that takes getting used to. Instead of shaking hands, they hold their hands together and bow slightly in greeting.</p>

<p><strong><em>The Attitude</em></strong>. Perhaps most important is what we can take away form a visit to Sri Lanka. I like to think that it has taught me the value of peaceful co-existence. Buddhists are live-and-let-live kind of folks and that is contagious after a few weeks spent here, especially after leaving America last month in the midst of election season divisiveness, acrimony and polarization. Buddhists, Hindus, Muslims and Christians seem to live together peacefully, even to the point of celebrating each others’ holidays.</p>

<p><a href="http://blog.lesterpickerphoto.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/04/DSC_2124.jpg"><img class="size-medium wp-image-2102" title="DSC_2124" src="http://blog.lesterpickerphoto.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/04/DSC_2124-198x300.jpg" alt="" width="198" height="300"></a></p>

<p>… and some things I don’t like so much</p>

<p><strong><em>Sanitation</em></strong>. First, many Sri Lankans eat with their hands, using their thumb and two fingers to create a ball of rice and curry, for example. You may not see this in hotel restaurants, but in the privacy of their homes (even well-heeled homes) and in local eateries, the traditional continues. I love cultural traditions like these and this would not be so bad if everyone washed before eating, but sadly that is not the case. And most Sri Lankan men, I noted, do not wash after using public restrooms, perhaps because there is often no soap or paper towels and the cloth towels you see hanging in restrooms look like they’e been used by auto mechanics for the past two months. The moral of the story is to carry wipes and hand cleanser with you everywhere.</p>

<p><strong><em>Environment</em></strong>. Sri Lanka is a drop-dead gorgeous country, but it would be a lot more inviting to western tourists if the nascent environmental awareness movement caught hold. Litter is everywhere and there are few organized cleanups. In the south coastal region, hit hard by the 2004 tsunami, that is most noticeable in beaches that are littered with trash.</p>

<p><strong><em>Driving</em></strong>. Scary. You find yourself gripping your seat belt and praying that when the crash occurs, it won’t be too painful. See my <a href="http://blog.lesterpickerphoto.com/2012/04/13/driving-in-sri-lanka-dont/">previous post</a> on this topic.</p>

<p><strong><em>Changes Are Coming</em></strong>. With their war against terrorism behind them, Sri Lanka is ripe for development. Hotels along the beach and near parks are going up. Asian investors are salivating over Sri Lanka’s potential. My fear is that much of the culture, pace and lifestyle will change. My hope is that the Buddhist ethic will survive to create a tourist haven that dares to be different.</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>Nearly every tourist who visits Sri Lanka will also visit Yala National Park. Aside from its Buddhist temples which attract millions of adherents, Yala NP is Sri Lanka’s second largest draw for visitors.</p>

<p>I personally had misgivings about visiting the park, having been on safari in Africa. However, after spending 6 game drives in the park, I’m here to tell you that Yala is a worthwhile, wonderful experience… with some caveats, especially for families with younger children. Please note that I&#8217;m posting this blog while I&#8217;m still in Sri Lanka and so did not have an opportunity to post-process my images. I&#8217;ll post the completed images to <a href="http://www.lesterpickerphoto.com">my gallery website</a> as soon as I can, given my travel schedule.</p>

<h3>Not Your Typical Park</h3>


<p>Yala is huge, with narrow, rutty roads criss-crossing the park. You must enter in an approved jeep. I suggest you make sure you hire a guide that speaks your language better than passably, as you’re bound to have many questions (one precious question I heard from a young girl in a nearby jeep at a watering hole was why that massive bull elephant had two trunks; one dangling from its head and the other between its legs. Mom and Dad had a good time explaining that one!).</p>

<p><a href="http://blog.lesterpickerphoto.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/04/DSC_1547.jpg"><img class="size-medium wp-image-2090" title="DSC_1547" src="http://blog.lesterpickerphoto.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/04/DSC_1547-194x300.jpg" alt="" width="194" height="300"></a></p>

<p>What the narrow roads and forested topography mean is that animal spotting is an active pursuit. It doesn’t just happen. You drive all morning or afternoon to earn your sightings. Most people make two safaris in a day, one in the early morning and the other starting at 3:00 PM until the park closes at six. If you can only do one, do the afternoon where leopard sightings are more common. Do not make the mistake of taking a late morning jeep ride. The animals hide and sleep most of the afternoon due to the heat. However, don’t promise the kids a leopard sighting. One couple I met did eight safaris without spotting one. Leopards are very elusive animals, so count your blessings even if you get a distant sighting.</p>

<p>As a result of the narrow roads and very limited sight lines caused by the forest and shrubs, whenever a leopard is sighted <a href="http://youtu.be/YOKjFdAnd04">masses of jeeps</a> race to the scene and from both road directions. The upshot is a nightmarish traffic jam that can take an hour to clear as jeeps vie for a good spot for their clients. No one is allowed to venture out of the jeep and the jeeps may not leave the road, so it can be terribly frustrating for photographers. Best to have your own jeep for maneuverability and to use that time instead on landscapes or other animals.</p>

<p>In fact, if you are photographer I strongly recommend you take a private jeep tour. I did both the first day and then ended up hiring a private jeep for my remaining visits. Costs are very reasonable for a private jeep (be prepared to bargain). That way you can stop wherever you like. But you will not be able to get out of the jeep anywhere within the park. That is a strict rule and a driver will lose his license if you violate that directive.</p>

<h3>Where You Stay Makes a Difference</h3>


<p>If you plan to visit Yala, make sure to choose a hotel close to the park. The closest one, Chaaya Wild Lodge, is pricey, but the accommodations and food are first rate. If you cannot stay there, I suggest you be within 30 minutes of the park. The reason is that the park opens at 6:00 AM and you want to be right at the entrance with your jeep driver by six.  As is you’ll be getting up at 5:00AM; 4:00 AM is even less fun. And do NOT rely on mileage. The roads leading to Yala are barely that. They are pockmarked, rutted and in terrible repair, so a distance of even 5 km may take 20 minutes or more. Most hotels will pack a hearty box breakfast for you, but be sure to check. Most tours will stop at a safe haven on the Indian Ocean for a 15 minute breakfast and bathroom (spelled b-u-s-h-e-s) break.</p>

<p><a href="http://blog.lesterpickerphoto.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/04/DSC_1729.jpg"><img class="size-medium wp-image-2091" title="DSC_1729" src="http://blog.lesterpickerphoto.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/04/DSC_1729-300x201.jpg" alt="" width="300" height="201"></a></p>

<h3>Wildlife Galore</h3>


<p>In Yala you will see an abundance of wildlife, but do not go with the expectations of African safaris. You’ll see no herds of animals here, other than small groups of deer or water buffalo. Also, Yala is a forest park. The roads are exceedingly rutty and narrow, meaning that passing an oncoming jeep is a negotiation that happens dozens of time in your tours. However, if you can get past that, here is a partial list of animals I saw in three days of safari. Since it is primarily a forest park, wildlife will virtually step out of the forest right in front of you, even gigantic bull elephants, but then disappear just as quickly. As in Africa, wildlife tend to congregate at waterholes, so your safari will visit many of these.</p>

<p>Mongoose</p>

<p>Toucan</p>

<p>Wild boar</p>

<p>Peacock</p>

<p>Elephant</p>

<p>Green Bee Eater and Chestnut-Headed Bee Eater</p>

<p>Water buffalo</p>

<p>Pelican</p>

<p>Leopard</p>

<p>Land monitor</p>

<p>Fish eagle</p>

<p>Changeable hawk eagle</p>

<p>Spotted deer</p>

<p>Crocodiles</p>

<p>Brown fish owl</p>

<p>Tortoise</p>

<p>Rabbit</p>

<p>Storks</p>

<p>Cranes</p>

<p>Jungle Fowl (Sri Lanka’s national bird)</p>

<p>Bear (very rare sighting)</p>

<p>Samba deer/elk</p>

<p>Silver langur monkeys</p>

<p>Jackal</p>

<p>I named only a sampling of birds, since I am not a serious birder and there were dozens of birds that true birders were ga-ga over.</p>

<p><a href="http://blog.lesterpickerphoto.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/04/DSC_1775.jpg"><img class="size-medium wp-image-2092" title="DSC_1775" src="http://blog.lesterpickerphoto.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/04/DSC_1775-300x211.jpg" alt="" width="300" height="211"></a></p>

<h3>Don’t Forget the Landscape</h3>


<p>Yala is bounded on one side by the Indian Ocean, adding a strikingly beautiful element for photographers. As well there are rocky promontories and tortuous trees waiting for your creative interpretation.</p>

<p><a href="http://blog.lesterpickerphoto.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/04/A0018976.jpg"><img class="size-medium wp-image-2093" title="A0018976" src="http://blog.lesterpickerphoto.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/04/A0018976-300x225.jpg" alt="" width="300" height="225"></a></p>

<h3>Photo Recommendations</h3>


<p>If you plan on photographing in Yalla, here a some tips:</p>

<p>First and foremost, bring lots of water as it can get hellishly hot and humid. Also bring food.</p>

<p>Tell your driver right away that when he stops for viewing to shut off the engine immediately. That will reduce shaking and result in better photos.</p>

<p>Use a good tripod or bean bag to stabilize your images, another good reason to have a jeep all to yourself or with one other person.</p>

<p>Bring a polarizer for landscape images.</p>

<p>Be patient. You can go for 2-1/2 hours without seeing a leopard and then suddenly a beautiful male or mother with a cub is right there.</p>

<p>There are plenty of elephants in the park and your nearly guaranteed to see some. But, unlike Africa, you’ll see small families, not large family groupings.</p>

<p>Absolutely essential is a dust-proof bag to completely cover your camera(s). Yala is a very dusty environment and with jeeps constantly passing by the dust problem is real. Develop a ritual to uncover your gear when you shoot, then immediately cover it again when you’re done.</p>

<p>Clean your camera after every safari segment. Do not wait. Bring a blower, brush, cleaning fluid and cloth with you and have it ready in your hotel room. On site use a blower and a LensPen brush/lens cleaner.</p>

<p><a href="http://blog.lesterpickerphoto.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/04/A0018981.jpg"><img class="size-medium wp-image-2094" title="A0018981" src="http://blog.lesterpickerphoto.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/04/A0018981-300x225.jpg" alt="" width="300" height="225"></a></p>

<p>I’ll add some more tips as I think of them, so please check back periodically.</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>I am thoroughly enjoying my stay in Sri Lanka, an island off the southern coast of India. It has a very long history of self-governance, subjugation to foreign powers (think Portugal and Britain, to name just two), followed by self-governance once again. Today, some two years after it signed a peace treaty with the Tamil Tiger rebels in the north, the country is a relatively stable democracy (Is any democracy really “stable?”).</p>

<p>Seventy-five percent of its people are Buddhist, with Hindus making up 15% and Muslims and Christians together representing 7.5%. I have been struck by how incredibly seamlessly the religions coexist and respect each other, knowing each others‘ holidays, beliefs and practices.</p>

<p>Both Buddhists and Hindus have, over the centuries, built exquisite temples and monasteries, worthy of extensive photography, if only I had enough time this visit. I do intend to return, though.</p>

<p><a href="http://blog.lesterpickerphoto.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/04/A0018543.jpg"><img class="alignnone size-medium wp-image-2080" title="A0018543" src="http://blog.lesterpickerphoto.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/04/A0018543-300x229.jpg" alt="" width="300" height="229"></a></p>

<p>This is one example, a monastery built into a cliff overhang and known as the Dambulla Cave Temple. In many temple enclaves, you will find both Buddhist and Hindu places of worship, although not in Dambulla. Over the centuries the two religions have intertwined so that they share a few of the same deities.</p>

<p>Photographically, Sri Lanka is a complex place to plan a visit. You&#8217;ll want to have a tripod with you to record its architecture and landscapes, but you&#8217;ll also need a good short zoom (like the Nikon 24-70) for markets and people. Always bring a polarizing filter with you, of course, wherever you travel. And ALWAYS ask permission before you stick a camera in someone&#8217;s face or think you are smart by photographing someone surreptitiously from far away with your long zoom. As always, let common courtesy prevail.</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>One thing you should know if you’re thinking of driving in Sri Lanka… don’t! Hire a local driver (very reasonable), keep your eyes closed, and bring your rosaries or whatever else might endear you to your particular God. (Click on the short mini-videos I took, below.)</p>

<p>First, as a former British colony, Sri Lankan’s drive on the left side of the road, which is disconcerting for those of us that come from right-sided countries. But the basic issue with driving in this interesting country is… well… the drivers.</p>

<p>Road markings carry little meaning here on the mostly narrow and <a href="http://youtu.be/UF8bYW7SbX8">heavily congested roads</a>. Cars cross into opposing lanes constantly. Motorcyclists weave in and out of traffic, ignoring any rules of the road (if there are any here). Tuk-tuks, tiny three wheel vehicles that carry passengers, will drive on pedestrian walkways, narrowly avoiding collisions with people.</p>

<p>Buses will lurch into opposing traffic and then swerve at the last possible millisecond to avoid a head-on collision. The group I was with got to rating these near misses as one might at an Olympic event. The closest to a near-death experience was a 9.9 with an oncoming bus, where both drivers swerved at impossibly sharp angles in a nanosecond.  Neither hesitated and rove on as if nothing had happened. Breakfast definitely did not taste as good the second time around.</p>

<p>There is also a horn etiquette, where drivers announce their intention to pass and then give two short honks either to thank the driver they just passed, or as an offering to Buddha that they lived to scare their passengers yet again… and again. There are even traffic jams on safaris!</p>

<p><a href="http://blog.lesterpickerphoto.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/04/photo.jpg"><img class="size-medium wp-image-2086" title="photo" src="http://blog.lesterpickerphoto.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/04/photo-300x225.jpg" alt="" width="300" height="225"></a></p>

<p>One final driving warning. Sri Lankans share the road very contentedly with cows and <a href="http://youtu.be/j_lj4RsQHgQ">water buffalo</a>. Since Sri Lanka is primarily rural and depends heavily on its own agricultural production to feed its people, and since the majority of Sri Lankans are Buddhist and venerate their animals, peaceful coexistence reigns supreme, even if it takes ten minutes to wait for <a href="http://youtu.be/s5KKgGSvzZ8">a herd of cows</a> to relinquish the road to their human caretakers.</p>

<p>So there you have it. Enjoy Sri Lanka, but don’t drive while there yourself!</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>I&#8217;m sitting here in my nearly empty hotel, after being one of only two people in the restaurant. At 2:49 this afternoon, as I was on safari in Yala National Park in Sri Lanka, the government ordered all tourists evacuated from the area. An 8.8 magnitude earthquake of the Sumatran coast triggered fears of a tsunami. In 2004, Sri Lanka lost 30,000 people, including many tourists, as a result of a similar earthquake near Sumatra. In that tsunami, most of the damage occurred along the southern and south-western coastal areas.</p>

<p><a href="http://blog.lesterpickerphoto.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/04/map_of_sri-lanka.jpg"><img class="alignnone size-medium wp-image-2077" title="map_of_sri-lanka" src="http://blog.lesterpickerphoto.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/04/map_of_sri-lanka-300x225.jpg" alt="" width="300" height="225"></a></p>

<p>I was driven 60 miles inland to higher ground, but there was no panic among the locals, but a lot among the tourists. I waited for hours past the prime time when the tsunami was predicted to hit, then returned to my hotel near the coast along with my driver and translator, Susil, who had dinner with me. If you look at the map, you&#8217;ll find Yala on the southeastern side. I am presently staying between Yala and Tissamaharama. After my safaris, I&#8217;ll spend the Buddhist New Year&#8217;s celebration photographing at a Buddhist temple in Tissa, as locals call the town.</p>

<p>Now we&#8217;re on watch, just in case of a major aftershock, buit that is considered so unlikely we were allowed to return. I have to get up at 4:30AM to be back at the magnificent Yala NP for sunrise.</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>By my second day in Sri Lanka, I began to notice the considerable number of dogs lying around next to roads or scavenging for scraps of foods. In most cases these dogs are not a pretty sight. Most are thin, many are mangy and flea-ridden. While the more fortunate animals have caring owners, by far the majority of the dogs I saw were feral.</p>

<p><a href="http://blog.lesterpickerphoto.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/04/A0018816.jpg"><img class="alignnone size-medium wp-image-2066" title="A0018816" src="http://blog.lesterpickerphoto.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/04/A0018816-225x300.jpg" alt="" width="225" height="300"></a></p>

<p>The feral dog problem is interesting. In past years the government has tried dog control programs, none of them very successful. More successful are its rabies control efforts. The reasons for these failures and successes are complex, but are rooted in the country’s Buddhist majority.</p>

<p><a href="http://blog.lesterpickerphoto.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/04/A0018773.jpg"><img class="size-medium wp-image-2067" title="A0018773" src="http://blog.lesterpickerphoto.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/04/A0018773-230x300.jpg" alt="" width="230" height="300"></a></p>

<p>Invariably, dog euthanization efforts fail because Sri Lankan Buddhists believe the dog may be a reincarnated spirit, and so when the animal control officers come around, they will say that the feral dogs belong to them. On the other hand, rabies control efforts are very successful because it benefits both dogs and people.</p>

<p>In any event, the upshot is that dogs are found everywhere in Sri Lanka, mostly sleeping on their sides in the hot Sri Lankan sun. Or in train stations, on rocks, in bazaars, in alleyways. They care not a whit that people are walking around and stepping over them. On one trip, a small macaque monkey scavenged in front of, around and over a sleeping dog who opened one eye every so often, but otherwise seemed quite content.</p>

<p><a href="http://blog.lesterpickerphoto.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/04/A0018623.jpg"><img class="size-medium wp-image-2068" title="A0018623" src="http://blog.lesterpickerphoto.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/04/A0018623-300x225.jpg" alt="" width="300" height="225"></a></p>

<p>None of the dogs I saw were aggressive in any way. Instead, they sometimes come up to you, tail between their legs, looking for scraps of food. Most will adopt a family and just hang out around their homes, if they are in a rural area. In towns and cities, the dogs will hang around parks or in front of shops. People do not seem to mind at all and never once did I see a person shooing a dog away. Peaceful coexistence ala Buddhism.</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>Right now I&#8217;m staying at <a href="http://www.chaayahotels.com/chaayawild.htm">Chaaya Wild Yala Lodge</a>, which borders Sri Lanka&#8217;s Yala National Park. The lodge is simply gorgeous and I do mean both simply and gorgeous. To minimize uninvited &#8220;guests&#8221; the individual lodge cabins are simply, but elegantly decorated. Even so, I am sharing my room with five very cute- and very fast- geckos.</p>

<p><a href="http://blog.lesterpickerphoto.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/04/DSC_1315.jpg"><img class="size-medium wp-image-2072" title="DSC_1315" src="http://blog.lesterpickerphoto.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/04/DSC_1315-300x200.jpg" alt="" width="300" height="200"></a></p>

<p>The grounds are gorgeous, with a natural lake on one end and the Indian Ocean on the other. Crocodiles and any number of birds are visible from the reception area.</p>

<p>However, the park&#8217;s leopards, elephants, monkeys, wild boars and snakes regularly roam the premises at night, requiring guests to call for an escort when walking from their cottages to the restaurant, pool or reception areas at night. This sign clinches it of rme.</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>It&#8217;s one of those events that photographers crave, when we run into some rich cultural event entirely by accident. And that&#8217;s the way not came down yesterday, when I happened into a Hindu Festival to the god Murga, know to locals here as Cataragama. Murga is the god for families and for those people starting a new business venture. Its adherents are a passionate bunch, as you will see here.</p>

<p><a href="http://blog.lesterpickerphoto.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/04/DSC_10661.jpg"><img class="alignnone size-medium wp-image-2059" title="DSC_1066" src="http://blog.lesterpickerphoto.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/04/DSC_10661-300x215.jpg" alt="" width="300" height="215"></a></p>

<p>This man was one of several who put a stick through his cheek to show his devotion, or in some cases to prove their worth for blessings from the god. The festivities begin the night before and wind from the temple a few kilometers away to the town center and back. The festivities include fire walking and putting sticks through the skin of the back. The Hindus participating in the procession dance themselves into a frenzied trance. They can dance like this for 24 hours.</p>

<p>The object you will see on the back of the dancer in the video is normally kept in the temple, but is removed once a year for this festival.</p>

<p><a href="http://youtu.be/PJCO1VoMtnU">Here is a 1-minute video</a> of the street scene I came upon.</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>Rope making has a long and storied history in Sri Lanka. Known formerly as the British colony of Ceylon, Sri Lankans have been making rope from coconut husks for centuries. The ropes were used in Her Majesty&#8217;s navy, as well as hundreds of other uses.</p>

<p>I had the opportunity to visit with a family business that still makes coconut ropes the old fashioned way. I thought I&#8217;d share this fascinating peek into a rural business with you. I have two videos to go along with it.</p>

<p>It all starts with the coconut, from which all manner of products are made, including shampoos, cooking oils, liquor, soap&#8230; the list goes on. Once the fruit and meat are removed, what is left is the husk.</p>

<p><a href="http://blog.lesterpickerphoto.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/04/images.jpeg"><img class="size-full wp-image-2055" title="images" src="http://blog.lesterpickerphoto.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/04/images.jpeg" alt="" width="259" height="194"></a></p>

<p>Now the women (yes, it is primarily a women&#8217;s occupation), take these husk sections and put it through a machine that combs the fibers and orients them in the same direction. <a href="http://youtu.be/i16SnuxFpNs">Here is what that process looks like.</a></p>

<p>Once the husk sections are completed, the worker has a huge pile of fibers from which to make the rope. In this next video, you can see how they use simple machines to <a href="http://youtu.be/A33xcEYkjec">spin the fibers into continuous rope</a>. They then combine individual ropes to make double, quadruple and even thicker ropes. It&#8217;s truly a time-intensive process, which is one of the reasons that coconut rope is valued by many to this day.</p>
