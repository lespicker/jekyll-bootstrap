  <div class="entry-content"><p>I had a gallery show last night, which is a lot of work to put on, but also very enjoyable. I love meeting people at these events and they area great source for contacts, talking to some interesting folks and even some revenue.</p>

<p>About halfway through the evening a couple walked in. The man was a big, friendly bruiser and he walked straight over to this black &amp; white, unframed print that was hanging up. I watched him peer closely at it for a moment and then turn to his wife and say something. She shook her head approvingly. Curious, I walked over to them to see if they had any questions about the image.</p>

<p><a href="http://blog.lesterpickerphoto.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/07/LAP2875-1.jpg"><img class="size-medium wp-image-2257" title="_LAP2875 (1)" src="http://blog.lesterpickerphoto.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/07/LAP2875-1-199x300.jpg" alt="" width="199" height="300"></a></p>

<p>In the way of background, this has always been one of my favorite images, if for no other reason than it reminds me of the day I took it. I was in Canada and was taken to this spot by a friend of mine, the talented photographer <a href="http://www.darwinwiggett.com">Darwin Wiggett</a>. We hiked through pristine woods to find this vehicle sitting in the midst of a forest. How did it get there? When did it get there? Most curious was what model car was it? I figured I&#8217;d never find out.</p>

<p>Now back to my story at the gallery. I walk over to the couple and introduce myself. The man turns to me and, pointing to the print, simply says:</p>

<p>&#8220;1942 Chevy Coupe with suicide doors and a Flathead V-8 engine.&#8221;</p>

<p>At first I stood there dumbstruck. Then I burst out with a hearty laugh, thanked him profusely and wrote down the information as he repeated it to me. He walked out and I smiled for the rest of the evening every time I glanced at the print.</p>

<p>You just never know.</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>On Friday, July 6, beginning at 6:00 PM, I will be the featured artist at La Banque de Fleuve in Havre de Grace, Maryland. This is part of Havre de Grace’s seasonal tradition of First Fridays which plays out from May through October in grand fashion along its downtown streets.</p>

<p>I love First Fridays. There is music (and dancing) in the street by many bands and solo performers, from jazz to rock to folk. There is scrumptious food to be sampled from street vendors and our terrific town restaurants. Street performers roam around providing entertainment for families. There is a vintage car show and crafts of all kinds. Most of all are the wonderful people you meet, coming from all over the region.</p>

<p>This is the very first time my work will be featured in La Banque, a unique and impressive event and meeting venue in the heart of downtown. La Banque, as its name implies, is a historic granite bank and the immense, walk-in vault is still on display and functions as a wine-tasting room.</p>

<p><a href="http://blog.lesterpickerphoto.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/06/A0017443-Edit-Upres.jpg"><img class="size-medium wp-image-2250" src="http://blog.lesterpickerphoto.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/06/A0017443-Edit-Upres-300x150.jpg" alt="" width="300" height="150"></a></p>

<p>If you are looking for a memorable time, please visit Havre de Grace on Friday evening, July 6. If you print out this blog or its notice on Facebook or Twitter, I’ll extend 10% off the purchase of any of my images, framed or unframed. I&#8217;ll have framed Limited Edition prints for sale, as well as unframed works, and sale items. So, if you&#8217;re looking to decorate a home or office, or just searching for that perfect piece of art, please stop by. Browsers are also most welcome.</p>

<p>I look forward to seeing you there!</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>For most of my life I’ve been a film photographer. In those days the mantra I followed was that when I pressed the shutter, my job was essentially done. I’d send my K64 film off to Kodak, get my transparencies back a week later, present them to my editors and cash my check. Done.</p>

<p>Not anymore. In today’s digital age, I figure my job is maybe 25-50% done when I press that shutter button. Even though I really do not do much post-processing, digitally captured images do need some tweaking, especially if you are shooting in RAW with settings on ‘neutral.’ The truth is I don’t even know how to use PhotoShop. I entered the digital game too late in life to teach this old dog tricks of that complexity, although I admit to a certain degree of envy when I watch my assistant, Bob, handle PhotoShop like it was an extension of his fingers. Instead, I post-process in Lightroom and, if needed, use the Nik software line of products to do some tweaking. Mostly that involves just using Viveza.</p>

<p>However, there are some instances where you just have to do some significant post-processing and this past week was one of them. I thought I’d share that with you.</p>

<p>When I was in Iceland, I was shooting some waterfalls with both my Hasselblad H4D-50 and my new Nikon D800. On each lens I had a polarizer, so I could fine tune the reflections in the water. A polarizer reduces the amount of light hitting the sensor by about 1 stop or maybe a bit more, which was good in this case because I wanted the water to have a smooth look to it which you can only achieve with a very slow shutter speed.</p>

<p>In fact, I did not like the results I was getting. I wanted to slow the water down even more. But I was already shooting at ISO 50 on the Hassy, the lowest setting it would take. So, I added a 4-stop neutral density filter, meaning I was holding back about 4 stops of light. ND filters block light hitting the sensor without causing color shifts. Or that is what they are supposed to do.</p>

<p>I got my slowed down water movement all right. But when I got home and examined my images, I saw that they had a very pronounced color cast. They all had a yucky (that’s a technical term, btw) pink-magenta cast.</p>

<p><a href="http://blog.lesterpickerphoto.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/06/A0019604.jpg"><img class="size-medium wp-image-2246" title="A0019604" src="http://blog.lesterpickerphoto.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/06/A0019604-300x225.jpg" alt="" width="300" height="225"></a></p>

<p>We picked up the phone to talk to the incredible Bob Singh, the maker of Singh-Ray filters. Bob is one of the most knowledgeable people in the industry and while his products are costly, they are high quality all the way and backed by Bob’s technical genius.</p>

<p>Without getting too technical, it turns out that the ND filter I was using blocked out visible light in a different proportion to the infrared (IR) light, and that was responsible for the color shift. The solution was simple. Bob could make a filter that filtered both sets of wavelengths so that this would not happen again. I ordered one immediately. I’m a believer in getting it right in-camera and not digitally manipulating the image after the fact.</p>

<p>But, what to do with the images I already had? In this case Bob (my assistant) worked his magic in PhotoShop CS6. It took quite a bit of doing, messing with color channels and temperatures and such, but in the end he was able to render the scene pretty near what I had experienced, which is the image that follows. That pretty well reinforces my belief that in some situations post-processing work is an effective and necessary tool.</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>By now I hope you are all in the throes of summer, enjoying the warm weather and capturing lots of ‘keeper’ outdoor images. Of course, no passionate landscape/wildlife photographer ever gets enough time outdoors or enough keepers to feel fully satisfied. It’s like eating a great meal. At the end you feel wonderful, but in a few hours you’re hungry again.</p>

<p>As you go through your summer routine, why not take notes on areas of your photography that you’d like to improve? Do you have trouble interpreting light well enough to nail perfect exposures? Do your compositions lack punch? Are your images ‘soft’ looking?</p>

<p>I am a voracious digester of photographic information, so books and articles are my first stop when learning a new technique, keeping up with technological advances, or reading about the exploits of my colleagues. But at some point, I invariably find that I have to put those readings into practice by actually getting outdoors to try them. Sometimes I go out photographing with colleagues and marvel at the way they choose to interpret a scene, what techniques they apply and the post-processing they do to render their unique creative vision.</p>

<p>That is why I so strongly recommend that amateurs immerse themselves in photo workshops from time to time, whether to learn new techniques, see new vistas led by a photographer guide, or share ideas and images with fellow enthusiasts. Photo workshops ideally should be a small group. They are a lot of fun, mixed with some terrific take-aways in terms of techniques and ideas.</p>

<p>I’m leading just such a workshop to Acadia National Park along Maine’s photogenic rocky and forested coast beginning October 18. Fall is a gorgeous time of year in Maine, with reds and yellows and browns painting vivid landscapes. This 4-day experience will be chock full of vistas-to-die-for (but of course I promise to keep things very safe). Photography along the Maine coast is entirely weather dependent, but I’ve chosen venues that we can access in rain, shine or fog. Speaking of fog, that is definitely one of my favorite times to photograph in Maine.</p>

<p><a href="http://blog.lesterpickerphoto.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/06/LAP2300.jpg"><img class="size-medium wp-image-2238" title="_LAP2300" src="http://blog.lesterpickerphoto.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/06/LAP2300-300x199.jpg" alt="" width="300" height="199"></a></p>

<p>I lived in Maine for ten years and actually did part of my doctoral work in ecology in Acadia NP. I think I know some of the nicest photo locations there. Suffice it to say that we’ll be visiting the storied rocky coast, the park’s pristine forests, marshes and ponds, picturesque towns and even some lobster boats. We’ll be on the move from sunrise to sunset (Did you know that Acadia’s Cadillac Mountain is the first place to witness sunrise in the U.S.?).</p>

<p><a href="http://blog.lesterpickerphoto.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/06/LAP8300.jpg"><img class="size-medium wp-image-2239" title="_LAP8300" src="http://blog.lesterpickerphoto.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/06/LAP8300-300x199.jpg" alt="" width="300" height="199"></a></p>

<p>While the workshop is offered through the Nikonians Academy, where I am a faculty member, it makes absolutely no difference what make camera you have, whether you use a point-and-shoot or a $50,000 super pro setup, or whether you are a beginner or advanced amateur. You are guaranteed to learn something, meet interesting fellow photographers and have a good time (did I mention lobster dinner??). The course is strictly limited to 10 photographers. Only five spots remain.</p>

<p>On one or two of the evenings we will get a chance for a voluntary critique of our work (mine included). No one is coerced into offering their images up for group sacrifice. It’s all very informal and friendly and I’ve never had anyone say they did not benefit from even passively observing. I know I always get a lot out of these sessions (alternately, you could choose to skip it entirely and get an extra hour of shuteye!).</p>

<p><a href="http://blog.lesterpickerphoto.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/06/Maine-2009-longpond1-1_-2__tonemapped.jpg"><img class="size-medium wp-image-2240 " title="Maine-longpond" src="http://blog.lesterpickerphoto.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/06/Maine-2009-longpond1-1_-2__tonemapped-199x300.jpg" alt="" width="199" height="300"></a></p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>I received the following email a few days ago from one of my regular blog readers.</p>

<p><em>Les, </em></p>

<p><em>As an experienced and successful photographer I would appreciate your thinking on something that has bothered me for a long time. There is no end to the array of photography products that are introduced: cameras, lenses, etc.  There is always something new to be found in photography periodicals, store advertisements (e.g. Adorama, B+H )and so on. I ,for one, simply can never afford to get into that game and there has to be some rational way for saying to oneself , &#8220;enough already!&#8221;   I very much want to grow and learn in my retirement years but sometimes I feel overwhelmed by what I read about some product that is &#8220;new and revolutionary&#8221; …. You are a professional and obviously your needs are different than mine, i.e., to be a first rate amateur photographer especially interested in nature and landscape scenes.  I guess that you have been asked that question on different occasions.  I would appreciate if you would let me have the benefit of your thinking. </em></p>

<p> </p>

<p>Thanks, Harry. In truth, I do get asked this often, and so I thought I’d respond here (Harry gave me permission to reprint his question).</p>

<p>First, I can’t agree with you more. After a while it can get to be more of a game than a true necessity. The obvious beneficiary are the camera and accessory companies. The question that one must face, whether amateur or pro, is whether or not the latest, greatest is really necessary to get quality images.</p>

<p>I’ll be the first to say that some of the products really represent major advances and should be thoughtfully considered. Others represent small conveniences that make picture-taking far easier and more enjoyable. Take my Hoodman loupe, for example (<a href="http://www.hoodmanusa.com/products.asp?dept=1017">www.hoodmanusa.com</a>). That’s one small, inexpensive device that I could not live without. It has truly changed my picture taking for the better.</p>

<p><a href="http://blog.lesterpickerphoto.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/06/HLPP3_11full.gif"><img class="alignnone size-medium wp-image-2232" title="HLPP3_11(full)" src="http://blog.lesterpickerphoto.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/06/HLPP3_11full-300x199.gif" alt="" width="300" height="199"></a></p>

<p>When it comes to major items, such as cameras and lenses, I have serious doubts about the latest, greatest. Some improvements are incremental. Let me give you an example. I owned and enjoyed my Nikon D300 camera. Then Nikon came out with the D300S. It allowed one to take videos. I don’t take videos, so it had no appeal to me.</p>

<p>On the other hand, I own a Nikon D700, which is a 12 mega-pixel (MP) camera. It is a very fine, even wonderful camera. In the past several years my clients have demanded larger and larger images (we are currently producing a 29-foot image for one of our hospital clients!). So, when the Nikon D800 camera debuted a couple of months ago, touting a 36-MP sensor, I jumped. Those extra pixels will enable me to make much bigger and sharper enlargements. That is the main reason I spent $3,000 for a camera that essentially does just what my D700 does. (BTW, my D700 is now for sale, with a host of accessories. If you’re interested, please contact me.) So far the D800 has met my high expectations.</p>

<p><a href="http://blog.lesterpickerphoto.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/06/images.jpeg"><img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-2233" title="images" src="http://blog.lesterpickerphoto.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/06/images.jpeg" alt="" width="229" height="221"></a></p>

<p>Do I need the D800 to make a good image? Of course not. Good images are a combination of good light, good composition, technical mastery and creative vision. Lots of great images are made on iPhones and 12 MP cameras. If all you will do with your images is post them on Facebook or other electronic venues, then a point-and-shoot will do nicely. If you are only making prints up to 8.5” x 11”, then there’s no need to upgrade.</p>

<p>The same holds true for lenses. I have some Nikon lenses that are more than 30 years old and they still perform flawlessly and work with even my newest D800. Unless there is a compelling reason for me to buy a new lens, I’m fine with the assortment I have. Periodically I will sell an older lens to upgrade to a newer one, but there is always a reason for my doing so. I recently upgraded my 200-400mm lens because I was shooting more wildlife and needed a faster lens that I could use effectively in lower light conditions and would also enable me to blur the background so that the main subject stands out. It’s hard making money in photography today, so my main rule is that only if I feel the new product can help me make better, more salable images will I consider buying it.</p>

<p>Hope this helps.</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>Every so often I like to challenge my readers with a photo assignment; not a meaningless exercise  to fill blog space, but one based on a photographic experience that I recently had. That was the case with this next assignment. My hope is that you will find it as challenging as I did.</p>

<p>The back story is that I was in Iceland recently and found myself at the famous iceberg beach, an experience to which I had looked forward for years. Unfortunately, the photo gods had a good laugh that day and presented us with hurricane force winds. So, once out of the car I knew that I would be unable to change lenses. I had to choose only one lens, a terrible predicament for a professional photographer. Should I shoot long or short, zoom or prime?</p>

<h3>Your Assignment Beckons</h3>


<p>This assignment runs the risk of driving even the most able photographer crazy. Pick only one lens, preferably a wide-angle prime lens (meaning a lens with only one focal length). Now go out and shoot with it. There are tons of lessons to learn with this exercise, probably the most important of all how to crop your scene in the camera. Instead of zooming in and out you’ll have to haul your butt back and forth to capture the scene you envision. Some of my best shots have been taken when I’ve left a needed lens home and am forced to shoot with the “wrong” lens. In the case of my Iceland iceberg experience, I chose a prime (my 28mm Hasselblad lens, fitted with a tilt-shift mechanism, making it effectively a 42mm lens&#8230; in 35mm format that would be equivalent to a 33mm lens) and came away with some images I liked. If I had the luxury of choices that evening, I most probably would have chosen my 50-110mm Hasselblad zoom, focused on the icebergs themselves and missed the wider beach shots that gave my images context, texture and mood.</p>

<p><a href="http://blog.lesterpickerphoto.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/05/A0020163-as-Smart-Object-1.jpg"><img class="alignnone size-medium wp-image-2226" title="Iceland icebergs" src="http://blog.lesterpickerphoto.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/05/A0020163-as-Smart-Object-1-300x225.jpg" alt="" width="300" height="225"></a></p>

<p><strong>Variation</strong>. If you do not own a prime lens, restrict yourself to one zoom lens, BUT keep it on ONE zoom setting.</p>

<h3>Telephoto Only</h3>


<p>Now, on a separate outing, try just the opposite. Go with a telephoto only. In the image below I shot the Grand Canyon with a telephoto lens, rather than the standard wide-angle lens that most everyone else uses there. The back story is that I was exhausted after a day of climbing and frankly did not have the energy to take off my pack, change lenses or camera bodies, reframe and shoot. Still, I was happy with this image, which is fundamentally the opposite of what most people try to capture at the Grand Canyon.</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>Iceland: Favorite Places to Stay</p>

<p>After 16 days spent here, I’ve experienced many types of lodging in Iceland. Some are of the more common hotel type, while others are farms or homes converted or adapted to tourist trade use. Lodging options are sorely needed in Iceland, as the tiny population of 320,000 must cater to more than 500,00 tourists annually (and growing).</p>

<p>First, a few things to know about touring in Iceland. Every place I stayed had wireless Internet capability. Only one place charged for it, but the fee was nominal- less than a US dollar an hour.</p>

<p>Hotels are… well, hotels. They mostly offer all expected amenities, even small gyms in some cases. Iceland also offers a wonderful option for tourists, and one I highly recommend. It is called Icelandic Farm Holidays (<a href="http://www.farmholidays.is">www.farmholidays.is</a>). These include more than 150 farmhouses, guesthouses, country hotels and cottages.</p>

<p>I found every single one of these accommodations to be excellent. They were clean and tidy and very welcoming. The big plus is that you get to meet, talk with and share laughs with the local proprietors.</p>

<p>A few cautionary notes. Bring your own shampoo. Most accommodations include a soap dispenser in the shower, but no shampoo. Bring disposable washcloths, available at online travel sites. Few accommodations offer them. And then there are breakfasts. Leave your scrambled eggs and bacon preferences at home. Here you will find an incredibly standardized breakfast throughout the country. Cold cereals, hard boiled eggs, cheese, breads, sliced meats, and some pastries. The breakfasts are plentiful and hearty, but not what most North Americans expect.</p>

<p>Finally, touring in Iceland is easy. The main roads are paved and well maintained. However, if you plan to take gravel roads (there are many of them) or go into mountainous areas, you must have  4-wheel vehicle. If you are caught driving non-4-wheel drive on these restricted roads you pay a hefty fine. Having said that, I did rent a 4-wheel drive and found exploring these side roads a heck of a lot of fun. They also offered tons of photographic opportunities.</p>

<p><strong>Hotel Keflavik</strong>. After a long flight from abroad, I suggest at least one night in Keflavik, where the international airport is located. Hotel Keflavik (<a href="http://www.hotelkeflavik.is/en">http://www.hotelkeflavik.is/en</a>) offers very comfortable rooms, an excellent, expansive  breakfast, and a gym with sauna and massage service. The staff is helpful and knowledgeable (thanks, Ella and Anna). It’s the perfect way to recover. I suggest you spend an extra night and tour the peninsula on which the hotel is located, especially the ancient fishing site of Selatangar. There are some great photographic locations there and all along the loop. You could easily spend 2 days exploring (I did!).</p>

<p><a href="http://blog.lesterpickerphoto.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/05/DSC_2381.jpg"><img class="size-medium wp-image-2211 " title="DSC_2381" src="http://blog.lesterpickerphoto.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/05/DSC_2381-300x200.jpg" alt="" width="300" height="200"></a></p>

<p><strong>Bogarnes Bed and Breakfast</strong>. I did a separate review of this precious little B&amp;B here. En route to the Snaefellsness peninsula you may want to overnight <a href="http://blog.lesterpickerphoto.com/2012/05/09/iceland-a-jewel-in-borgarnes/">here</a>.</p>

<p><strong>Langaholt</strong>. If you visit the Snaefellsnes Peninsula north of Reykjavik, it would be hard for me to imagine anyone who would not love the ambience and comforts of Langaholt <a href="http://www.langaholt.is/Langaholt/EN/Index.aspx">http://www.langaholt.is/Langaholt/EN/Index.aspx</a>). Proprietor Thorkell (“Keli”) Simonarson and his girlfriend Rúna Björg Magnúsdóttir have created a warm, welcoming, funky and completely absorbing guesthouse on a converted farm. Every day during season Keli’s father brings in fresh trout and char from a nearby lake and his mother fillets them and serves them immediately for breakfast or dinner (<a href="http://youtu.be/1bSYaSZHzu4">this video is a must watch</a>!). Their artist friend Thordis Claessen has adorned their walls with some very unusual images reflecting local mythology. Langaholt also features a small golf course located right on their oceanfront property.</p>

<p><a href="http://blog.lesterpickerphoto.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/05/A0020455.jpg"><img class="size-medium wp-image-2212" title="A0020455" src="http://blog.lesterpickerphoto.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/05/A0020455-300x225.jpg" alt="" width="300" height="225"></a></p>

<p><strong>Hotel Hellnar</strong>. For a more upscale experience, try Hotel Hellnar (<a href="http://www.hellnar.is">http://www.hellnar.is</a>/), at the foot of the Snaefellsjokull glacier and right on the ocean. One of four family owned and managed hotels on the peninsula, you’ll find fine dining and immaculate rooms. The Hotel is near to many photographic sites, including a lighthouse with attendant rocky shore, and a magnificent geological formation. Old, abandoned farmhouses can also be photographed.</p>

<p><a href="http://blog.lesterpickerphoto.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/05/A0020568.jpg"><img class="size-medium wp-image-2213 " title="A0020568" src="http://blog.lesterpickerphoto.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/05/A0020568-300x225.jpg" alt="" width="300" height="225"></a></p>

<p><strong>Guesthouse Steig</strong>. If you drive east along the spectacularly gorgeous south coast, then you’ll want to stay at Guesthouse Steig ( <a href="http://guesthousesteig.is/Home/Rooms/">http://guesthousesteig.is/Home/Rooms/</a>), a real working sheep farm. Here Ausrun Guthmundsdottir and her husband Olafur Stigsson have built a separate guesthouse with spotlessly clean and comfortable rooms. Ausrun’s marvelous Icelandic sheep dog and two house dogs are a definite plus, but I’ll always remember Asrun’s friendliness and her wonderful hugs. While you are there, remember to ask her to show you the jar of volcanic ash she has saved from the latest eruption.</p>

<p><a href="http://blog.lesterpickerphoto.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/05/A0019880.jpg"><img class="size-medium wp-image-2216" title="A0019880" src="http://blog.lesterpickerphoto.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/05/A0019880-225x300.jpg" alt="" width="225" height="300"></a></p>

<p><strong>Hali Farm</strong>. This guesthouse/farm is the hardest accommodation for me to describe. First, Hali (<a href="http://hali.is">http://hali.is</a>/) is a working farm, with more than 150 sheep and 30 milking cows. Plus, it raises more than 250,000 char in its aquaculture operation (talk about fresh fish for dinner!).  Hali is also a community of people dedicated to the ideals of its relative Thorbergur Thordarson, one of Iceland’s most famous writers, philosophers and naturalists.</p>

<p>The farm includes a wonderful museum that houses a collection of Thordarson’s writing, but also interesting educational and interactive exhibits of life in Iceland several generations ago.</p>

<p><a href="http://blog.lesterpickerphoto.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/05/photo2.jpg"><img class="size-medium wp-image-2215" title="photo" src="http://blog.lesterpickerphoto.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/05/photo2-300x225.jpg" alt="" width="300" height="225"></a></p>

<p>The guesthouse itself is a collection of separate buildings, with clean, comfortable rooms and views of the ocean and mountains. The dining room is open for breakfast and dinner. I recommend the fresh char dinner.</p>

<p>The farmhouse is close to the iceberg lagoon dear to the heart of photographers. Just make sure that you visit across the road to the ocean side, where stranded bergs are a delight to capture on sensor or film. Be sure to dress warmly.</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>I have come to find out that religion is a funny sort of thing in Iceland. While most Icelanders identify themselves as Christian, a 2011 Gallup poll found that 60% of them do not feel religion is important in their lives. That&#8217;s one of the highest percentage of irreverent believers in the world.</p>

<p>Most Icelanders are of the Lutheran denomination, although few actually attend church any more on a regular basis. Paganism, or more accurately naturism, is still practiced by many. Still, Iceland is dotted with almost as many churches as waterfalls (an exaggeration, of course, since Iceland has far, far more waterfalls than churches).</p>

<p><a href="http://blog.lesterpickerphoto.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/05/A0019323.jpg"><img class="size-medium wp-image-2201 " title="A0019323" src="http://blog.lesterpickerphoto.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/05/A0019323-300x225.jpg" alt="" width="300" height="225"></a></p>

<p>Most of the churches are tiny affairs, built for yesterday&#8217;s agrarian population, where  family gathered to celebrate their faith. Today, these churches sit empty and may return to use a few times each year when family gathers again for holidays.</p>

<p><a href="http://blog.lesterpickerphoto.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/05/A0020325.jpg"><img class="size-medium wp-image-2202" title="A0020325" src="http://blog.lesterpickerphoto.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/05/A0020325-300x225.jpg" alt="" width="300" height="225"></a></p>

<p>Nearly every church is built in the same style; simple, trim, even austere. And while there are abandoned and tumble-down farm buildings throughout Iceland, I never once saw a church in a state of disrepair. Both church and its cemetery, always walled with stone or fencing, were meticulously maintained.</p>

<p>Once in a while I passed a more modern rendition of  a church, where the architect was daring enough to change just a roofline to achieve an effect without assaulting the Icelandic sensibility.</p>

<p><a href="http://blog.lesterpickerphoto.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/05/A0019652.jpg"><img class="size-medium wp-image-2203 " title="A0019652" src="http://blog.lesterpickerphoto.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/05/A0019652-300x225.jpg" alt="" width="300" height="225"></a></p>

<p>A quote from the famous Icelandic writer, naturalist and philosopher Thorbergur Thordarson I think sums it up for a large swath of Icelanders:</p>

<p>&#8220;<em>This little bowl of a valley was elongated and lay right under the sky-I often saw sheep there. How I envied these animals in the sunshine and warmth of summer. Or, if I was supposed to go out and bring in dung for fuel or harvest the hay when a great deal needed to get finished. I would pray fervently to God to turn me into a sheep up in Slettibotn, though I wanted to turn back into a human before slaughter time. But God never heeded my prayers, either about this or anything else, which is why our ways parted early in my life.</em>&#8221;</p>

<p>In all cases, I have to say, I found that the church structures complemented the natural environment, adding a point-counterpoint, human-nature effect to the landscape. In any event, they were fun to photograph and I look forward to my next visit to Iceland to spend more time exploring their photographic possibilities.</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>For the past few days, I&#8217;ve been battling severe windy conditions here in Iceland. By severe I&#8217;m talking gale force to hurricane force winds. If there is anything that a photographer hates most it is wind. The skies can be blue, the clouds picturesque, the scene illuminated with golden light. But if the wind is blowing, it&#8217;s hard to stay steady enough to capture a good image. How, then, do the pros do it.</p>

<p>The following image was taken, believe it or not, on a freezing cold beach on Iceland&#8217;s south coast, with the winds blowing at hurricane force (that&#8217;s 70+ miles per hour)! Click on the image to enlarge it.</p>

<p><a href="http://blog.lesterpickerphoto.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/05/A00201851.jpg"><img class="alignnone size-medium wp-image-2192" title="A0020185" src="http://blog.lesterpickerphoto.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/05/A00201851-300x225.jpg" alt="" width="300" height="225"></a></p>

<p>My colleague and I sat in our vehicle for ten minutes, looking over the spectacular black sand beach, the icebergs in the water being buffeted by giant waves, and nature&#8217;s fury lashing at the waves head on. Should we chance it or not. We discussed the pros and cons and for a second or two I had the 4-wheel in reverse, ready to leave. But the failing light of day convinced us to at least give it a try.</p>

<p>Bundled up, we trudged the 150 yards to the shoreline, the wind lashing our backs with grains of sand. Our most immediate concern was with our gear, which we protected as best we could, helped by the fact that the wind was on our backs and not sand-blasting our lenses.</p>

<p>The secret was to stay low, tripod legs extended to provide a stable base. In winds I typically hang my backpack from the hook on the underside of my tripod to add mass and stability. In this case I wanted to use a low ISO to show movement in the water and to highlight the dark sands. For you photography nuts out there, my equipment included a Hasselblad H4D-50, 50-110mm lens set at 95mm, an aperture of f18 and a shutter speed of 1/2 second, using a cable release. I also had a polarizing filter on the front of the lens both to decrease shutter speed so I&#8217;d get movement but also, truth be told, to protect my lens just in case.</p>

<p>This is only one of a series of images I took. It is not processed at all (I am still on the road in Iceland). I just wanted to illustrate a point about photographing in wind.</p>

<p>This next image I took on a stop the very next day, with the winds still at gale force. This small waterfall beckoned from the road as I passed and so I put on my wool hat, wind parka and hood and gloves and set up next to the falls. Again, I stayed low, spread out my tripod legs, hung my pack from the center hook and shot away. I also took a panorama of this falls, which I hope to share with you in the next month or so in a blog I&#8217;ll do on panorama shooting. The equipment was the same as above, but I shot it at ISO 50, f11, 1/3 second to show water flow.</p>

<p><a href="http://blog.lesterpickerphoto.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/05/A0020289.jpg"><img class="alignnone size-medium wp-image-2193" title="A0020289" src="http://blog.lesterpickerphoto.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/05/A0020289-300x225.jpg" alt="" width="300" height="225"></a></p>

<p>Normally, in winds you want to shoot at as fast a shutter speed as possible in order to minimize shake and blurring. But I was faced with the conundrum of wanting to shoot slow to soften the water. My point here is that even this can be done if you pay attention to basics; a sturdy tripod with cable release, good technique and, most importantly, perseverance.</p>

<p>If you&#8217;d like to follow my tracks in Iceland in real time, <a href="http://share.findmespot.com/shared/faces/viewspots.jsp?glId=0Zg1LmM9KoFvIGRUsieGHuXYN1cCXNV5a">go to my personal SPOT GPS page</a>, where you will see where I am, the topography and even a satellite image of the area.</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>I&#8217;m constantly in awe as I travel the Ring Road around Iceland. For one thing, I can&#8217;t drive for a mile without seeing a waterfall, whether up close and personal or in the distance. At one point I counted six waterfalls in one view.</p>

<p>Iceland has to be a geologist&#8217;s or a vulcanologist&#8217;s Valhalla. And if not seeing waterfalls, one is nearly always in sight of a glacier. Some sit atop Iceland&#8217;s many mountains. Others have accumulated enough mass to advance down valleys in their unstoppable flow to the sea.</p>

<p>Iceland&#8217;s glaciers are both magnificent and frightening. As the glaciers advance, they scour the land before them, toppling trees, grinding boulders to gravel, and pushing millions of tons of earth before them like a bulldozer. Here is a scene at the Svinafellsjokull glacier along the south coast of the island, showing the advancing edge of the glacier with some of the earth it has scoured in its path.</p>

<p><a href="http://blog.lesterpickerphoto.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/05/A0020105.jpg"><img class="size-medium wp-image-2182 " title="A0020105" src="http://blog.lesterpickerphoto.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/05/A0020105-300x225.jpg" alt="" width="300" height="225"></a></p>

<p><a href="http://www.hartmier.com">Richard Hartmier</a>, my photo buddy from Yukon, Canada, and I stopped at the glacier for a photo shoot. The wind was blowing mightily and we had been warned that a storm was approaching. Richard went off on his own to photograph the icebergs that slough off the glacier and accumulate in a deep meltwater pond in front of it. I chose to climb the ledges on the left side of the glacier that you see in this picture.</p>

<p><a href="http://blog.lesterpickerphoto.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/05/A0020125.jpg"><img class="size-medium wp-image-2183 " title="A0020125" src="http://blog.lesterpickerphoto.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/05/A0020125-300x225.jpg" alt="" width="300" height="225"></a></p>

<p>I managed to get a semblance of the shot I was looking for, but not without some drama. The winds were gale force, so I opened my tripod as wide as the narrow ledge permitted me to in order to stabilize my setup. I took off my backpack, which weighs about 30 pounds, and hooked it to the underpart of the tripod to add mass and further stabilize it. I began to shoot, but the winds suddenly picked up to hurricane force (75+ mph), nearly toppling my tripod and ripping my neutral density filters from my hand. At that time it was quits for me and I struggled to get my gear packed without being blown over the precipice. I would have liked to stay longer, even climbing higher to get rid of the rock on the left side of the image and getting a view of the entire snow-capped mountain, but I also wanted to live to tell about it, so prudence won out. In this image you can see the winds blasting snow from the glacial pack and barreling them down the valley.</p>

<p><a href="http://blog.lesterpickerphoto.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/05/A0020117.jpg"><img class="size-medium wp-image-2184" title="A0020117" src="http://blog.lesterpickerphoto.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/05/A0020117-300x225.jpg" alt="" width="300" height="225"></a></p>

<p>To give you all an idea of how strong the wind was, I did <a href="http://youtu.be/WQ8WKOsLjsA">a tiny video clip</a> of Richard when we stopped at another part of the glacier. Now Richard is not a little guy and he was almost toppled by the gusts at various points during the day.</p>
