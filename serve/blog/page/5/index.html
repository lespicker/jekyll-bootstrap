  <div class="entry-content"><p>Before I left for Yellowstone a couple of weeks ago, I was anxious about only one photographic issue. How would my Hasselblad H4D batteries perform in the cold weather?</p>

<p><a href="http://blog.lesterpickerphoto.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/01/imgres-1.jpeg"><img class="size-medium wp-image-2555" title="imgres-1" src="http://blog.lesterpickerphoto.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/01/imgres-1-300x165.jpeg" alt="" width="300" height="165"></a></p>

<p>Of course Hasselblad is a superb camera system, second to none and I love its luscious, film-like images and incredible dynamic range. Those of you who follow my blog know that I shoot Nikon and Hasselblad. But ever since I started using Hassy, I have been disappointed in its battery capacity. My Nikon D200, D300, D700 and now the D800 keep going and going, like the Energizer bunny. I can get 1,000 clicks and more from a single charge. But with my Hassy, if I got 100 shots outdoors I considered myself fortunate. So I was apprehensive prior to leaving for the north.</p>

<p>Then, one day while researchiong the issue of the Internet, I found a post by &#8220;HLArt&#8221; on the Hasselblad Digital Forum. I followed his advice and I haven&#8217;t had a problem in normal temps ever since. But Yellowstone in winter was far different!</p>

<p>Well, I am happy to report that my Hassy batteries lasted either all day or close to it, and that was at temps that fluctuated between -13F to +25 (mostly below zero). For those of you who follow such things or are frustrated by your Hassy batteries, may I recommend HLArt&#8217;s procedure, which I quote here in its entirety.</p>

<p>&#8220;So here&#8217;s how to reset an H battery if it is not holding a charge or not lasting as long as it should.
First charge the battery fully, preferably overnight.
Then grab an H body with no battery on it and press and hold the &#8220;menu&#8221; and &#8220;flash&#8221; buttons, and while holding them down push the battery up onto the handgrip. You should then here a rapid series of beeps indicating the PMU on the battery has been reset. Now put the battery back on charge and it should improve performance.</p>

<p>On a side note new batteries will have a low initial capacity, cycle them through charge discharge (on the camera) a few times to get full capacity.&#8221;</p>

<p>Many thanks to HLArt from me and any Hassy users who may benefit from my reposting his advice. It sure worked for me!</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>I just returned from a rejuvenating trip to Yellowstone, a winter paradise if there ever was one. The temps ranged from -13F to +25F, far warmer than I had hoped, since I wanted to get the frosty breath of bison as they grazed. Still, just being out in our glorious natural world was reward enough. I did manage to see bison, coyotes, eagles (bald and golden), elk, mule deer, pronghorn antelope and three wolf packs, although the latter were too far away to photograph.</p>

<p><a href="http://blog.lesterpickerphoto.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/01/A0023497.jpg"><img class="size-medium wp-image-2548" title="A0023497" src="http://blog.lesterpickerphoto.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/01/A0023497-300x225.jpg" alt="" width="300" height="225"></a></p>

<p>One of the most frequently asked questions I get about winter photography is how to photograph snow. Moose Peterson, a terrific wildlife photographer, recently had a blog on the topic where he recommends pushing your exposure a stop or two over your meter reading to get snow white. I agree with his advice, with a caveat.</p>

<p><a href="http://blog.lesterpickerphoto.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/01/A0023499.jpg"><img class="alignnone size-medium wp-image-2550" title="A0023499" src="http://blog.lesterpickerphoto.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/01/A0023499-300x150.jpg" alt="" width="300" height="150"></a></p>

<p>If one doesn&#8217;t over-expose snow scenes, they will render a sickening gray color, due to the meter&#8217;s attempt to &#8220;neutralize&#8221; the scene and render the scene close to 18% gray. The typical thing to do is to open up a stop or two (or even 3) to get the snow to look white. The trouble is that photographers are afraid of blowing out the snow, meaning that the overexposure is so extreme all detail is lost in the snow. As soon as they see blinkies appear on their camera screens, they dial back. But when they get home they realize that  the snow scenes did not come out as they were hoping.</p>

<p>The reason I&#8217;m writing about this now is that something interesting happened after I uploaded my images to my home system. My assistant, Bob Boyer, is an accomplsihed indoor photographer and has a long career in working with models. Frankly, he is an expert on lighting who knows more about the science of it than anyone I have ever known.</p>

<p>While I was in Yellowstone, Bob was busily working on his own photo project back home, helping a young woman develop a modeling portfolio. He showed me a sample shot he took:</p>

<p> </p>

<p><a href="http://blog.lesterpickerphoto.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/01/DSC_2603.jpg"><img class="size-medium wp-image-2549" title="DSC_2603" src="http://blog.lesterpickerphoto.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/01/DSC_2603-300x200.jpg" alt="" width="300" height="200"></a></p>

<p> </p>

<p>Now, it may not occur to you, but the three shots here have striking similarities, and I do not mean that as an insult to this stunning model. Those similarities hold a valuable lesson for landscape and wildlife photographers. In both cases we have strong lighting on the subject, in my image natural lighting and in Bob&#8217;s case mixed lighting. There are even similar tones in the bisons&#8217; coats and the model&#8217;s hair. But for the present case, ignore those similarities.</p>

<p>What is notable is that in both cases the foreground is blown out. In Bob&#8217;s image he literally smashed his histogram purposely up against the right wall, far right of 255.  In my case I pushed to the right, but not quite to the wall. In retrospect, I should have shot a few frames another 1/2-1 stop to the right. I might have gotten more detail in the coats and faces of the bison. And what would I have lost? What did Bob lose in his image? Does anyone give a darn that the sheet in the foreground of the model is so overblown that there is no detail in it whatsoever? Hardly. Our brain interprets the scene and understands the context. The white represents sheets, or in my case snow, and we focus on the model or bison with no hesitation. The model&#8217;s face and body are perfectly exposed, a compelling high-key image.</p>

<p>The lesson here is that we should understand the limits of our cameras. We need to respect the abilities of these amazing machines, but be willing to outsmart them for creative purposes.</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>If there is one iconic species in Yellowstone, it would have to be the Bison. These immense creatures are the largest land mammals in America, with the bulls weighing around 2,000 pounds! Yellowstone bison were nearly eradicated by 1900, but in one of the most visible successes in the wildlife movement, Yellowstone now is home to between 3,000 and 4,000 of these magnificent creatures.</p>

<p>In winter one has to share the road with bison, as you can see here in my 20-second little iPhone <a href="http://youtu.be/MsbIXWhA3Xc">video clip</a>. (NOTE: Please turn down your sound as the day was biting cold (-10F) and very windy). The bison graze for a few hours in the early morning, chew their cud and then mosey to a new location for their afternoon grazing. One gets a sense of just how difficult it is to survive through the winter in these parts. The bison use their nose and massive head as snowplows as they swing it from side to side, burrowing down into the snow to get to the dried grasses beneath. That chore is energy intensive, especially inm the cold, so these guys have to eat massive am0unts of forage.</p>

<p><a href="http://blog.lesterpickerphoto.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/01/DSC_5329.jpg"><img class="size-medium wp-image-2544" title="DSC_5329" src="http://blog.lesterpickerphoto.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/01/DSC_5329-300x200.jpg" alt="" width="300" height="200"></a></p>

<p> </p>

<p>It seems as if wherever one drives there are small herds of bison grazing in fields. They are skitterish and now that packs of wolves hunt in Yellowstone, they are constantly on alert. But humans, too, are well advised to keep their distance as every year people are hurt here when they approach too closely. Despite their size they can charge to 30mph incredibly quickly.</p>

<p><a href="http://blog.lesterpickerphoto.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/01/DSC_5358.jpg"><img class="alignnone size-medium wp-image-2545" title="DSC_5358" src="http://blog.lesterpickerphoto.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/01/DSC_5358-300x200.jpg" alt="" width="300" height="200"></a></p>

<p> </p>

<p>Once I get back home I leave in six days for another outing, this time for a month. But as soon as I can I&#8217;ll process my Yellowstone images and post some of them them on my blog.</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>The frigid weather in Yellowstone cleared by mid-morning and by mid afternoon the temp hit a balmy 24 degrees. No more pain when taking off gloves to adjust something on the camera.</p>

<p>I did a two hour snowshoe trek to take photos of a tree-rock grouping, but when all was said and done I&#8217;m not liking the results on my laptop. I&#8217;ll hold off final judgment until I get home to a normal desktop screen.</p>

<p>On the way out of the park towards dusk, my colleague spotted a bighorn sheep ram on the side of a cliff and we pulled over to photograph. This guy was a gorgeous specimen, shown here eating some dried grasses (captured with a Nikon D800, 200-400mm Nikkor lens, Gitzo 3541 and RRS BH-55 ballhead, ISO 1600, f5.6, 1/800 sec).</p>

<p><a href="http://blog.lesterpickerphoto.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/01/DSC_5005.jpg"><img class="alignnone size-medium wp-image-2540" title="DSC_5005" src="http://blog.lesterpickerphoto.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/01/DSC_5005-200x300.jpg" alt="" width="200" height="300"></a></p>

<p> </p>

<p>I watched as he foraged his way down the cliffside, all the while looking up to the other side of a creek, where a female stood right at the top of the ridge line. Finally, he came down to the road, ran across and down the embankment to the stream. He walked back and forth, as if deciding whether or not to cross.</p>

<p><a href="http://blog.lesterpickerphoto.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/01/DSC_4979.jpg"><img class="size-medium wp-image-2541" title="DSC_4979" src="http://blog.lesterpickerphoto.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/01/DSC_4979-300x200.jpg" alt="" width="300" height="200"></a></p>

<p> </p>

<p>Truth be told, he did turn around and run back up the cliff where we first spotted him. His libido was just no match for the frigid river.</p>

<p>Tomorrow is supposed to be the same temps, but more blue sky, so I&#8217;m psyched!</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>My first full day in Yellowstone dawned gray, misty and freezing cold. Actually, it was way below freezing, namely -7 when I awoke, warming to 9 degrees F at 3:00 PM. The first day on site anywhere I travel is always an adjustment day, including deciding what lenses to bring, how to arrange everything in the car for quick access, debugging equipment that is resistant in below zero temps, and how best to dress while still being able to manipulate those teeny camera controls.</p>

<p>In winter there is only one road open to cars and that is the north entrance to the northeast entrance. Miserable as the day&#8217;s weather was we were able to spot herds of bison, elk and mule deer, a lone moose, three wolves, and two coyotes.</p>

<p>The most fun was photographing the coyote, despite his distance. He was at the far range of how I like to shoot my Nikkor 200-400mm lens, which is not to say I didn&#8217;t try. What attracted me in the first place  was the fact that he was hunting meadow voles and burying his face deep in the snow to sniff them out. Here&#8217;s a quick capture of him. Not a quality image, but it was late in the afternoon and I had a touch of altitude sickness all day, meaning I was shooting through a throbbing headache. But, then again, you&#8217;ve heard me say many times before that I never judge an outing solely by the images I bring back. For me, just being out there in this beautiful, natural world is reward enough.</p>

<p> </p>

<p><a href="http://blog.lesterpickerphoto.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/01/DSC_4746-Edit.jpg"><img class="alignnone size-medium wp-image-2535" title="DSC_4746-Edit" src="http://blog.lesterpickerphoto.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/01/DSC_4746-Edit-300x200.jpg" alt="" width="300" height="200"></a></p>

<p>Tomorrow I&#8217;m looking at the potential for better weather, although things shift fast up here at 6,200-8,500 feet. I&#8217;d like to get a few good bison images, as well as some landscapes. I&#8217;ll keep you posted. In the meantime, stay warm&#8230; for me.</p>

<p>Well, we arrived in Yellowstone National Park around 3:30 PM, far too late to photograph anything. My friend, Sherif Osman, and I took a quick jaunt through the park just to get our bearings. It was a foggy, cold, windy day, with temperatures around zero Fahrenheit. The sun had already set behind the mountains, but there was enough diffuse light for some amazing sightings. In just over an hour we saw mule deer, elk, and bison. As we rounded a bend on the park road, we saw some slow moving traffic coming our way. I thought I&#8217;d share that tiny <a href="http://youtu.be/MsbIXWhA3Xc">20-second iPhone video</a> with you. Man, those animals are big!</p>

<p>Stay tuned for more, as tomorrow we begin our photo safari.</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>Hello. My name is Les Picker and I&#8217;ve never been to Yellowstone. There, I said it! This is like AA for a landscape photographer like me. For 20 years Yellowstone National Park naturally comes up in conversations with my colleagues and I have to say I&#8217;ve never been.</p>

<p>&#8220;You&#8217;ve never been to Yellowstone?&#8221; they&#8217;ll ask, wide-eyed, all the while backing away as if I have a communicable disease.</p>

<p>It&#8217;s not that I never wanted to go. Honest. It&#8217;s been on my must-see list for years. It&#8217;s just that life gets in the way and I&#8217;ve never carved out the time. Well, that will change next week. I needed to be in Denver for a family event and I decided to use that as a take-off point for a 5-day jaunt into Yellowstone&#8217;s winter landscapes.</p>

<p>While it will be my first trip there, I usually do not travel to a place unless I plan on coming back. That&#8217;s because it takes me a while to get a lay of the land, to see what angles I&#8217;d like to take, to get the weather conditions right, and to understand the compositions inherent in the landscape. For me, that usually doesn&#8217;t happen on one short trip.</p>

<p>On this trip I&#8217;ll be taking my two trusty camera systems; Hasselblad and Nikon. For the Hassy H4D I decided to take my 28mm, tilt-shift attachment, 50-110mm, and 300mm. For my Nikon system I&#8217;ll be taking my D800, 24mm tilt-shift, 70-200mm and 200-400mm. Of course I&#8217;ll also have with me various filters and tons of batteries. I&#8217;m limiting my gear because I also have to pack snowshoes, and many layers of clothing.</p>

<p>My plan is to shoot early morning and dusk landscapes and animals, but also night shots, so sleep will have to wait until I get back. My hope is that I&#8217;ll also be able to grab an aurora image or two.</p>

<p><a href="http://blog.lesterpickerphoto.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/01/northernlights1.jpg"><img class="size-medium wp-image-2523" title="northernlights1" src="http://blog.lesterpickerphoto.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/01/northernlights1-199x300.jpg" alt="" width="199" height="300"></a></p>

<p>Anyway, please stay tuned as I will try to post a blog or two during my stay. And, if you&#8217;ve already visited Yellowstone in winter, I would love to get your recommendations on places to shoot.</p>

One of my favorite things was dialoging with you, my loyal readers, over a range of issues. You had questions for me, but also took the time to respond to questions I asked. For that I thank you.</p>

<p>This past year my travels took me to some interesting places, including Canada, <a href="http://blog.lesterpickerphoto.com/2012/05/09/iceland-saga-snaefellsnes/">Iceland</a>, <a href="http://blog.lesterpickerphoto.com/2012/04/14/sri-lanka%E2%80%99s-incredible-yala-national-park/">Sri Lanka</a>, <a href="http://blog.lesterpickerphoto.com/2012/03/25/israel-a-nation-of-stark-contrasts/">Israel</a>, and <a href="http://blog.lesterpickerphoto.com/2012/02/17/a-cold-night-in/">Finland</a>. In the States, I taught a workshop for the Nikonians Academy in Acadia National Park, a location I know and love, having done graduate school research in that gorgeous park. Yes, I feel fortunate to travel to some iconic places as a landscape and travel photographer, but oddly enough it is the wonderful people that I get to meet that makes my trips so special.</p>

<p>We also revamped <a href="http://www.lesterpickerphoto.com">our website</a> last month. There is still work to be done on it, but I&#8217;d love to get your feedback at this point to better inform our efforts. Please take a gander at the site and then leave your comments.</p>

<p>We also staged our <a href="http://www.magicinkjet.com/pages.php?name=les_picker_photography_case_study">largest permanent photo installation</a> yet, with more than 60 of my images placed in a new medical wing at Sinai Hospital in Baltimore, Maryland. We have an amateurish, but funny, <a href="http://blog.lesterpickerphoto.com/2012/09/17/wallpaper-mural/">1-minute video</a> showing the installation of one of our large wallpaper murals. Bob Boyer, our Master Printer, outdid himself in churning out some exceptional, finely detailed prints of my work. But we are also grateful to Museo Fine Art papers for their support. In case you haven&#8217;t realized from reading my blogs, we love, love, love the luscious Museo papers.</p>

<p>We also managed to put out another e-book in my series entitled <a href="http://shop.lesterpickerphoto.com">The Photographer&#8217;s Eye</a>. We now have three ebooks: Landscape, People and Wildlife.</p>

<p>Finally, I was incredibly honored to be given the prestigious<a href="http://blog.lesterpickerphoto.com/2012/07/19/worth-the-wait/"> Canada Northern Lights Award</a> for Best Travel Photography for 2011.</p>

<h3>Looking Ahead to 2013</h3>


<p>This year&#8217;s travel promises to be the most rigorous in several years. I start in Yellowstone in January, hoping to get some quality winter landscapes and wildlife. Then it&#8217;s off to Hawaii, which includes a 2-day hike down Haleakala crater with an Aussie couple that I met entirely by chance as I photographed a sunrise in Acadia last Fall. These nice folks have visited every National Park in the continental U.S. and I&#8217;ll lead then down the crater during their visit to that Park.</p>

<p> </p>

<p><a href="http://blog.lesterpickerphoto.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/12/PICKER-AAR-sample-20-of-20.jpg"><img class="size-medium wp-image-2513" title="PICKER-AAR sample 20 of 20" src="http://blog.lesterpickerphoto.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/12/PICKER-AAR-sample-20-of-20-300x184.jpg" alt="" width="300" height="184"></a></p>

<p>After Hawaii they&#8217;ll only have Alaska&#8217;s National Parks to go. What a great accomplishment!</p>

<p>In May I&#8217;ll be in Italy and Malta. In June I&#8217;ll spend a couple of weeks RV-ing around British Columbia with my good friend Ed Hill, a retired Royal Canadian Mounted Police officer. No one knows BC better than Ed, an outdoorsman who served as a Mountie there for more than 30 years.</p>

<p>In August I return to Canada, this time to Banff and Jasper in the Canadian Rockies. This year I&#8217;ll try to avoid a bear encounter. In the past two years I&#8217;ve had two uncomfortable &#8220;meetings&#8221; with a black bear and a Grizzly. What beautiful animals!</p>

<p><a href="http://blog.lesterpickerphoto.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/12/LAP_55761.jpg"><img class="alignnone size-medium wp-image-2510" title="LAP_5576" src="http://blog.lesterpickerphoto.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/12/LAP_55761-200x300.jpg" alt="" width="200" height="300"></a></p>

<p>Then it&#8217;s on to Sri Lanka in September, where I lead a <a href="http://www.nikoniansacademy.com/all/viewWorkshop.html?course_id=1062">workshop for Nikonians</a> and then two more <a href="http://www.nikoniansacademy.com/all/viewWorkshop.html?course_id=1057">workshops in Maine</a> in October. Last year&#8217;s workshop sold out, so if you&#8217;re interested, book early. November and December are not yet set, but I&#8217;m hoping for a trip to Africa.</p>

<p>We&#8217;ll also be doing two very exciting- and very different- photo workshops this year, but plans are still forming. I will announce them as soon as they are finalized.</p>

<h3>Sound Like a Dream?</h3>


<p>But, don&#8217;t let this seemingly idyllic travel fool you. It is work; hard work. Traveling today is a mess, pure and simple. Every week seems to bring new restrictions that make travel for a pro photographer miserable. Aside from all the things that affect our livelihood- like excess baggage fees, and the minor annoyances including long lines, and the arbitrary inspections of every camera, lens and accessory- there is the constant need to secure one&#8217;s equipment from theft and damage. I&#8217;ve lost thousands of dollars worth of equipment in recent years.</p>

<p>I also rarely get anyone else to make my travel arrangements, so in addition to prepping photographically, there are all the flights, lodging, transportation, research on photo locations, and even <a href="http://blog.lesterpickerphoto.com/2012/12/16/a-good-guide-is-heaven-sent/">hiring guides</a> when necessary. There were also the two occasions when I rolled back the covers in my motel room and had very special greetings, courtesy of a horde of bedbugs!</p>

<p>At my age, it&#8217;s often not fun to trudge up mountains with a 35-pound backpack or stand in -40 temperatures for 5 hours in the dead of night photographing the Northern Lights. But, I wouldn&#8217;t trade those inconveniences for anything. And here&#8217;s why.</p>

<p>If you want to feel how insignificant you really are, stand on a mountain in the Arctic at 2:00 AM as the Northern Lights suddenly flair to life (the first time I witnessed them, I cried). Or sit at the edge of the Grand Canyon at dawn as a condor with a 10-foot wingspan rides a thermal right in front of you.</p>

<p>I don&#8217;t like churches and synagogues. I personally can&#8217;t imagine that the way to get close to the Creator force is to sit in neat rows inside four walls. The only times I feel a spiritual connection is when I&#8217;m &#8220;out there&#8221; in the wild, recording nature. I stop, look around me and am always amazed at the abundance of life and its beauty. I breathe in the intoxicating forest smells and listen to the glorious sounds of a brook, birds flitting and singing around me. That&#8217;s when I know in my heart and soul that I wouldn&#8217;t trade what I do for any job in the world.</p>

<p>Here&#8217;s to a wonderful 2013 for us all!</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>One thing we don’t often discuss in travel writing and photojournalism circles is the art of guiding. Few things can make or break a long sought after vacation or travel adventure than a guide.</p>

<p>I was reminded of this on my just-ended trip to Israel, where I was blessed to have a professional guide by the name of Jacky Sivak every day of my 10-day tour. I’m really not the tour type, but I have to say that Jacky made every moment enjoyable. I’d take a tour with her any day.</p>

<p>As a registered tour guide, Jacky obviously had to meet the minimum standards of her industry. But what differentiated Jacky, and all good guides, from the merely mediocre, is her passion for what she does and her incredible grasp of historical fact and current facts-on-the-ground in Israel. This woman truly loves what she does and it shines.</p>

<p>I’ll link this to photography by saying that a good guide is nearly a must when you visit an area that you’d like to extensively photograph for the first time. A guide will impart to you knowledge gained from years of experience.</p>

<p>The absolutely best, most ideal situation is when your guide is also willing to help you porter your equipment. Ah, the relief, the joy, the luxury of that! Sharing the load allows you to concentrate on your photography. In most developing countries fees for such people are reasonable and provide critical revenue for your guide.</p>

<p>I had just such an experience most recently in Sri Lanka, where several regional guides helped me to carry my 30 pounds of equipment (I shoot Hasselblad and Nikon). My best situation was my driver, guide and porter rolled into one in a quiet, generous and industrious man named Susil Ranjith. Although his English was a bit rough (my Sri Lankan is totally nonexistent!), we still managed to communicate. After one day, Susil began anticipating my moves and would have my tripod legs extended, or my backpack held out in his hands ready for me to unzip and remove my gear. By the third day, I swear, he was suggesting excellent photo targets to me, even driving me to out of the way places that he thought would work.</p>

<p><a href="http://blog.lesterpickerphoto.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/12/A0019129.jpg"><img class="size-medium wp-image-2501" title="A0019129" src="http://blog.lesterpickerphoto.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/12/A0019129-300x225.jpg" alt="" width="300" height="225"></a></p>

<h3>A half-dozen tips for guides</h3>


<ol>
<li>
<strong>Ask around</strong>. Ask for recommendations from friends who have been to a locale you wish to visit</li>
    <li>
<strong>Check references</strong>. It is perfectly appropriate to ask a guide for recent references. Make up a list of characteristics that would be important to you. Call the guide(s) and ask questions to determine if there is compatibility.</li>
    <li>
<strong>Agree on fees in advance</strong>. This works both ways. You certainly don’t want to be charged for items that you thought were included. On the other hand, it is unfair to ask a guide to include sites that were never agreed to, or to show up with six extra cousins for the same fee. Be clear about what you expect him/her to do.</li>
    <li>
<strong>Discuss physical limitations</strong>. Many sites are difficult to traverse due to uneven paving. Other sites require fairly long walks to access. Bazaars and markets can be a challenge,too.</li>
    <li>
<strong>Agree to your itinerary</strong>. Be specific, but allow for those “I’ve got to stop for that image” opportunities.</li>
    <li>
<strong>Be astute.</strong> The first few days will be a mutual learning experience as you adapt to each other’s pace and modus operandi. Dole out responsibilities reasonably. I met a senior woman in Sri Lanka on my recent trip there who had hired a guide in India to porter her gear. He commented on how much nice equipment she had. When they got to a temple in India, he suggested she go in, take her time and photograph, while he watched her pack. She left her good gear and took a simple point-and-shoot with her. When she came back out, he was nowhere to be found!One solution to this, of course, is to check references or hire your guide through a reputable agency (usually at twice the going rate). Another option is to ask the guide for his driver’s license or government identification card and get a photocopy of these items.</li>
