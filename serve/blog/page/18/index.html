  <div class="entry-content"><p>I just received word about an interesting contest from my colleague, Scott Jordan, the CEO of <a href="http://www.scottevest.com">ScotteVest</a>, an outdoor clothing company based in Colorado. If you are a regular reader of my blog you know that I am the photography columnist for the ScotteVest website (you can find my columns <a href="http://www.scottevest.com/company/photography.shtml">here</a>), although I’d been using their fine clothing long before I began writing/photography for them. I find their clothing line to be perfect for photographers, with scads of pockets to store virtually every gadget we typically use. In fact, in my recent blog on my <a href="http://blog.lesterpickerphoto.com/2011/09/02/close-encounters-of-the-bear-kind/">bear encounter in the Yukon</a>, you can see that I was wearing my &#8220;uniform,&#8221; a ScotteVest Fleece 5.0 jacket.</p>

<p><a href="http://blog.lesterpickerphoto.com/wp-content/uploads/2011/09/pro_photographers_09_page.jpg"><img class="aligncenter size-medium wp-image-1603" title="pro_photographers_09_page" src="http://blog.lesterpickerphoto.com/wp-content/uploads/2011/09/pro_photographers_09_page-300x111.jpg" alt="" width="300" height="111"></a></p>

<p>SeV is offering a $10,000 <em><strong>Trip of Your Life</strong></em> contest that will send the lucky winner on their dream vacation, all decked out in the latest, greatest SeV clothing, of course!</p>

<p>Full details can be found <a href="http://www.scottevest.com/contest">here</a>. If you are the creative sort, this contest sounds like lots of fun and just might be your cup of tea (in India or China, for example).</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>The time is upon us; the quintessential season when photographers of every stripe dust off their lenses, check their camera batteries and hit the road to capture those radiant fall colors.</p>

<h2>Shooting Tips</h2>


<p>Here is a small sampling of my favorite tips for capturing fall colors, borrowed from my upcoming e-Book on fall photography and condensed for this blog.</p>

<h3>Look for Yucky Days</h3>


<p>Contrary to popular opinion, you can capture some of the best fall images on overcast days, particularly after a rainy spell. You just have to leave out the gray sky and instead focus on the forest canopy itself or on a tight shot of the forest floor.</p>

<p><a href="http://blog.lesterpickerphoto.com/wp-content/uploads/2011/09/dawsoncity1-1-of-1.jpg"><img class="size-medium wp-image-1592" title="dawsoncity" src="http://blog.lesterpickerphoto.com/wp-content/uploads/2011/09/dawsoncity1-1-of-1-300x199.jpg" alt="" width="300" height="199"></a></p>

<h3>Use a Polarizing Filter</h3>


<p>Polarizing filters cut glare, haziness and accentuate colors, making them pop off the printed page (or your iPod or iPad screen).</p>

<p><a href="http://blog.lesterpickerphoto.com/wp-content/uploads/2011/09/Hillsdale-Meadows-Banff-NP.jpg"><img class="size-medium wp-image-1593" title="Hillsdale Meadows, Banff NP" src="http://blog.lesterpickerphoto.com/wp-content/uploads/2011/09/Hillsdale-Meadows-Banff-NP-300x199.jpg" alt="" width="300" height="199"></a></p>

<p style="text-align: center;"></p>




<h3>Try a Neutral Density Filter</h3>


<p>For moving water, using a neutral density filter will help immensely. ND filters, as they are called, cut the amount of light reaching the sensor <em>without</em> affecting color. That means you will have to keep the shutter open longer to let in enough light, exactly what you want to do to make that water appear “soft.” However, you’ll also have to use a tripod to make this work.</p>

<p><a href="http://blog.lesterpickerphoto.com/wp-content/uploads/2011/09/SSP-RockRunStream-Version-2.jpg"><img class="size-medium wp-image-1594" title="SSP-RockRunStream - Version 2" src="http://blog.lesterpickerphoto.com/wp-content/uploads/2011/09/SSP-RockRunStream-Version-2-199x300.jpg" alt="" width="199" height="300"></a></p>

<p style="text-align: center;"></p>




<h3>Bring Along a Tripod</h3>


<p>Using a tripod allows you to take longer exposures, which may help you with images that show moving water, assuming you want a “softer” look to the water. It will also help on overcast days, as you’ll want to keep your ISO as low as possible to minimize grain.</p>

<p><a href="http://blog.lesterpickerphoto.com/wp-content/uploads/2011/09/Maryland-Harford-county-Falling-Branch_2009-10-22_1591%C2%A9LesterPicker.jpg"><img class="size-medium wp-image-1595" title="Maryland-Harford county-Falling Branch_2009-10-22_1591©LesterPicker" src="http://blog.lesterpickerphoto.com/wp-content/uploads/2011/09/Maryland-Harford-county-Falling-Branch_2009-10-22_1591%C2%A9LesterPicker-300x199.jpg" alt="" width="300" height="199"></a></p>

<p style="text-align: center;"></p>




<h3>Go Often and Stay Long</h3>


<p>The key to good fall images is to be there. That means repeat visits to your local park at different times of day and during varied weather conditions. Staying rooted in one spot often helps.  A couple walking down a leaf-strewn park lane makes for a dynamic photo. Deer, squirrels, fox and other critters may get used to your presence and perform for you&#8230; maybe even a bear.</p>

<p><a href="http://blog.lesterpickerphoto.com/wp-content/uploads/2011/09/LAP_5687.jpg"><img class="size-medium wp-image-1596 " title="LAP_5687" src="http://blog.lesterpickerphoto.com/wp-content/uploads/2011/09/LAP_5687-300x199.jpg" alt="" width="300" height="199"></a></p>

<h3>Double the Pleasure</h3>


<p>Fall is the perfect time to catch reflections in a pond or lake, thereby doubling the impact of the image.</p>

<p><a href="http://blog.lesterpickerphoto.com/wp-content/uploads/2011/09/Wedge-Pond-Canadian-Rockies.jpg"><img class="size-medium wp-image-1597" title="Wedge Pond-Canadian Rockies" src="http://blog.lesterpickerphoto.com/wp-content/uploads/2011/09/Wedge-Pond-Canadian-Rockies-300x199.jpg" alt="" width="300" height="199"></a></p>

<h3>Be Abstract</h3>


<p>Fall colors themselves are so outrageous you can rely on them alone to carry the image.</p>

<p><a href="http://blog.lesterpickerphoto.com/wp-content/uploads/2011/09/Fall-Foliage-13-Version-2.jpg"><img class="aligncenter size-medium wp-image-1598" title="Fall Foliage 13 - Version 2" src="http://blog.lesterpickerphoto.com/wp-content/uploads/2011/09/Fall-Foliage-13-Version-2-300x195.jpg" alt="" width="300" height="195"></a></p>

<p>Even in late fall, tight images of things like frozen leaves can be compelling.</p>

<p><a href="http://blog.lesterpickerphoto.com/wp-content/uploads/2011/09/SusqStPk2009-Version-2-Version-2.jpg"><img class="size-medium wp-image-1599" title="SusqStPk2009 - Version 2 - Version 2" src="http://blog.lesterpickerphoto.com/wp-content/uploads/2011/09/SusqStPk2009-Version-2-Version-2-199x300.jpg" alt="" width="199" height="300"></a></p>

<p>No matter what tips you read about, nothing beats actually getting out there and shooting. Like I said, now is the time to dust off those cameras and lenses…</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>Finally, I made a decision. It wasn’t easy to do, but after investing much more money than I had originally budgeted,  and lots of time, I’ve decided to give up on 4x5 large format (LF) film photography. In fact, if you’re looking for a great deal on my equipment, all in great condition, just write me… <a href="mailto:les@lesterpickerphoto.com">les@lesterpickerphoto.com</a>.</p>

<h3>Why I Went for Large Format</h3>


<p>I told you I’d keep you posted on this as the year - and my experiment- developed. I first got into large format because my clients often request large prints. No, I’m not referring to 20 x 30 inches here. I’m talking really big, like 5 FEET by 9 FEET! No 12 megapixel or even 24 megapixel camera is going to measure up to my standards when blown up to that degree.</p>

<p>A 4 x 5 view camera offers tons more real estate on which to place an image, making enlargements a breeze. Film still has some attractive properties that digital can’t quite match. Plus, I often like to slow down my photography and will spend hours capturing one image. So it seemed like LF would be a good match for me. Besides, I had my very capable assistant, <a href="http://photo.rwboyer.com/">Bob Boyer</a>, eager to help me make the transition. Bob has a good deal of experience in LF.</p>

<h3>The Barriers</h3>


<p>But, there were barriers I had to overcome to use LF proficiently. First there were the several films, each one of which one has to be intimately familiar with to make the proper choice for the circumstance. I was juggling Velvia 50, Ektar 100, Portra 160, Portra 400… I’m sure you get the point.</p>

<p>Then there were the various camera movements to learn, which it turns out I really enjoyed. After the first trial and error results, I started to really enjoy the final products as they came back from the lab.</p>

<p>Finally there were the myriad metering issues involved. LF is not like a point-and-shoot, or even a good DSLR like my Nikon equipment, in that the camera itself does the metering, and usually quite well. With LF I had to go back to my roots and use a hand-held meter. Then I had to decide in every circumstance whether I needed to use incident or reflected light readings, depending on my subject, how the scene was lit and the effect I wanted. Once the reading was obtained, I had to translate it into the correct f-stop and shutter speed.</p>

<p>Of course, we have all become spoiled by digital with its instant results, viewable on the LCD screen in a fraction of a second. With LF film photography it’s back to waiting until the film is packaged, mailed, processed and sent back to me. I also have to keep accurate records of each shot taken, so I can compare it to the final results. With digital, all that info is automatically available in the EXIF file information.</p>

<p>However, the biggest obstacle it turned out was the extra weight and bulk of lugging around the LF equipment. There was the camera itself, a wonderful piece of machinery by Arca-Swiss. Unfortunately, a LF camera takes up lots of room. Then there were the lenses, film, film holders, film changing tent, etc. Because I also had to take my 35mm equipment with me, I felt like a mid-Eastern caravan when I left the house for a shoot.</p>

<h3>The Final Decision</h3>


<p>Still, I kept giving it my best shot, so to speak, spending weekends and evenings trying to master the art. If nothing else you LF photographers have earned my undying admiration.</p>

<p>It was when I went to the Yukon on my most recent assignment that I made my decision. First, I had to take my normal 35mm equipment with me. That gets packed into a 45-50 lb suitcase, barely under the airline weight requirement. Plus, I carry my 200-400 lens as carry-on, and I still have accessories in my checked luggage!</p>

<p>Now, add to that a Pelican suitcase with 40 more pounds of 4x5 gear! Aside from an extra $50 in baggage fees each way, I had to lug that around the airport and into rental cars. I was still willing to make that sacrifice, but then this happened…</p>

<p>I was setting up on my LF equipment on a ridge at the Yukon border with North West Territory, overlooking a scenic valley and the ribbon of Dempster Highway below me. Big vista, a perfect opportunity for LF. It was cold, the winds were blowing, and so I had to move fast to get everything in before conditions shifted, which they do with alarming frequency above the Arctic Circle.</p>

<p><a href="http://blog.lesterpickerphoto.com/wp-content/uploads/2011/09/LAP2912.jpg"><img class="size-medium wp-image-1587" title="_LAP2912" src="http://blog.lesterpickerphoto.com/wp-content/uploads/2011/09/LAP2912-200x300.jpg" alt="" width="200" height="300"></a></p>

<p>So, set up camera on tripod, level it, open lens so I can compose and focus, duck my head under the focusing cloth, tilt, shift, swing, focus, tilt, focus again, fine tune, focus again, check with the magnifying loupe against the screen, focus more, take a meter reading, double check it, close the lens, cock the shutter, put in the film, take out the slider, press shutter release, put slider back in, take out film holder. Whew! One image taken. Oh, crap, that cloud covered the sun!</p>

<p><a href="http://blog.lesterpickerphoto.com/wp-content/uploads/2011/09/LAP2919.jpg"><img class="size-medium wp-image-1588" title="_LAP2919" src="http://blog.lesterpickerphoto.com/wp-content/uploads/2011/09/LAP2919-300x199.jpg" alt="" width="300" height="199"></a></p>

<h3>Looking Forward</h3>


<p>Now I’m back where I started, a bit wiser, but no further along in terms of gaining pixels. Now I have to sell my LF equipment. I’m already exploring some medium format options, which I now realize is probably a reasonable compromise. Instead of 12-25 megapixels, I’ll be able to get 40-80. I’m looking at the Hasselblad H4D-40 and the new Pentax 645D. Your opinion? As always, I’ll keep you informed.</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>Today my 5th visit to the Yukon is over. After 24 days in this majestic land, I’m heading home on Air Canada on a route that has by now become familiar to me. I’ll process some photos, write a bit, read a good novel (right now I’m reading <em>Eventide</em>, the sequel to the acclaimed <em>Plainsong</em> by Kent Haruf)), and begin thinking about my next visit.</p>

<h3>Take Our Workshop!</h3>


<p>Which brings up an interesting point. Richard Hartmier (<a href="http://www.hartmier.com">www.hartmier.com</a>)  and I are planning a photo tour of the Yukon next summer, stretching over the Labor Day weekend, when the Fall colors should be at their prime. If any of you have an interest in seeing some of the most spectacular vistas on Earth, tune in as I provide you with more details as the year progresses. The trip will be offered through <a href="http://www.Nikonians.org">Nikonians.org</a>, the largest Nikon organization in the world, with more than 300,000 members. I am a faculty member for <a href="http://www.nikoniansacademy.com">Nikonians Academy</a>, but you can use any camera system, or even a plain point-and-shoot, to join us for eight glorious, albeit rugged, days. If you are interested, please write me and I’ll put you on a special list for periodic updates: <a href="mailto:les@lesterpickerphoto.com">les@lesterpickerphoto.com</a>.</p>

<h3>Some Impressions</h3>


<p>Getting back to my latest Yukon visit, I’ll try here to recall some of the highlights of the photography part of my visit.</p>

<p>First, there’s the infamous bear spray issue. I had two occasions to use my can of bear spray this visit, once on a too curious bear and once on… well that’s a story for another blog. All I can tell you is that bear spray works. I gave only the tiniest spritz to a large grizzly only 7 or 8 feet from me and he took one sniff and backed up.</p>

<p><a href="http://blog.lesterpickerphoto.com/wp-content/uploads/2011/09/LAP_5576.jpg"><img class="size-medium wp-image-1579" title="LAP_5576" src="http://blog.lesterpickerphoto.com/wp-content/uploads/2011/09/LAP_5576-200x300.jpg" alt="" width="200" height="300"></a></p>

<p>The next highlight is a small wildlife moment, but one that makes nature photography so interesting. We saw lots of ptarmigans on our travels up the Dempster Highway. Ptarmigans are small chicken-sized birds that are endemic to the polar regions. In the southern part of the Yukon they were their typical gray and brown colors. Once we were up near the Arctic Circle they were beginning to turn into their winter color of pure white, an amazing transformation.</p>

<p>Another thing I recall is the waiting. As photographers we tend to forget all the time it takes to land that shot. This one of a grizzly, for example, took three hours of waiting, plus another hour of photographing, plus eight hours of driving up the washboarded Dempster, plus eight more hours from Whitehorse, plus a cross-country flight from Maryland and then the return trip. Does that give you an inkling into the cost of buying a signed fine-art landscape, wildlife or nature image?</p>

<p>Then there was the day we waited 45 minutes in a cold wind for a cloud to move so the sun would light up a hill properly for the image we envisioned. And the time we waited an hour for the wind to die down so we could capture reflections in a pond. Best of all was the three-day wait in cold and rain for a few decent images of <a href="http://blog.lesterpickerphoto.com/2011/08/28/the-bear-truth-and-other-musings/">grizzlies fishing for salmon</a> in Haines, Alaska. These are just some of the waits that photographers endure. But, how could I complain about waiting in some of the most pristine environments on the planet?</p>

<p><a href="http://blog.lesterpickerphoto.com/wp-content/uploads/2011/09/LAP2336.jpg"><img class="size-medium wp-image-1580" title="_LAP2336" src="http://blog.lesterpickerphoto.com/wp-content/uploads/2011/09/LAP2336-300x200.jpg" alt="" width="300" height="200"></a></p>

<p>At one point I stood on a rise, photographing the awesome Tombstone Valley. The weather was overcast, cold and windy, but there were breaks in the clouds that gave us hope the sun would punch through and light the far mountains. They never did, but no matter. Instead the clouds moved over us, temporarily obscuring our view. We took refuge in the truck. When the clouds blew away the mountains were coated with a cap of white. What a thrill!</p>

<p><a href="http://blog.lesterpickerphoto.com/wp-content/uploads/2011/09/LAP1559-Panorama-Tombstone-1.jpg"><img class="size-medium wp-image-1581" title="_LAP1559 Panorama-Tombstone-1" src="http://blog.lesterpickerphoto.com/wp-content/uploads/2011/09/LAP1559-Panorama-Tombstone-1-300x283.jpg" alt="" width="300" height="283"></a></p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>Klondike Gold Rush fever spread through the world in 1898, bringing tens of thousands of dreamers, mostly Americans, into the harsh and frigid reality of the Yukon. Dawson City was its epicenter, but to get there those Klondikers had to endure a months-long journey against Mother Nature that was brutal beyond imagination. During its peak year, almost 90,000 people lived in and around Dawson City, where before there had been a tiny outpost and First Nations dwellers.</p>

<p>When the gold rush ended, gold mining by larger corporations continued until the early sixties. But what is little known by the outside world is that small claim gold mining has continually existed. It lives on in the spirit of a hardy bunch of dreamers even today.</p>

<h3>Yukon Mining Today</h3>


<p>I had a rare chance to visit the normally secretive world of the small claim gold miner, to learn about how these men and women etch out a living from the Yukon’s very soil. It’s fascinating tale for those of you interested in the nexus of history, geology and mineralogy.</p>

<p>Even today, anyone can stake a claim to mine gold in this incredibly beautiful country. The fees are modest and once registered the lone miner usually second mortgages his home or begs and borrows from friends and relatives to buy the equipment needed to extract these metals and minerals from the earth. Few miners today pan for gold, although some still do. Most miners here do what is known as placer mining, derived from the Spanish, meaning “a place where gold can be extracted from gravel.” Placer mining involves using massive amounts of high pressure water to forcibly remove equally massive amounts of soil and gravel from a hillside in order to expose and recover the gold.</p>

<h3>One Miner’s Story</h3>


<p>I visited the claim of Ralph Troberg, who has been mining his patch of ground near Bonanza Creek for the past 40 years.</p>

<p><a href="http://blog.lesterpickerphoto.com/wp-content/uploads/2011/09/LAP3233.jpg"><img class="size-medium wp-image-1567" title="_LAP3233" src="http://blog.lesterpickerphoto.com/wp-content/uploads/2011/09/LAP3233-199x300.jpg" alt="" width="199" height="300"></a></p>

<p>Ralph mined full time until 1991, when the price of gold dipped so low it was not economical to mine anymore. For 15 years he depended on his training as a heating mechanic in his own business. With the rise of gold to new historic highs in recent years, Ralph is back to full time mining, a calling that he loves dearly. Mining nowadays is often a family operation.</p>

<p>“My son would join me if he could,” Ralph told me. “But his job and family situation in Edmonton prevents him from leaving right now.” In the same way, many women were brought up in mining families and have their own claims.</p>

<p>On a typical day, Ralph will draw water from the creek along a piping system with a series of check valves.</p>

<p><a href="http://blog.lesterpickerphoto.com/wp-content/uploads/2011/09/LAP3265.jpg"><img class="size-medium wp-image-1568" title="_LAP3265" src="http://blog.lesterpickerphoto.com/wp-content/uploads/2011/09/LAP3265-199x300.jpg" alt="" width="199" height="300"></a></p>

<p>These pipes run water to what is known as a monitor, or a hose setup that blasts high speed water towards the exposed soil.</p>

<p><a href="http://blog.lesterpickerphoto.com/wp-content/uploads/2011/09/LAP3257.jpg"><img class="size-medium wp-image-1569" title="_LAP3257" src="http://blog.lesterpickerphoto.com/wp-content/uploads/2011/09/LAP3257-199x300.jpg" alt="" width="199" height="300"></a></p>

<h3>A Miner’s Workday</h3>


<p>Ralph will operate this monitor for 12-16 hours a day during the 100-day period that the Yukon does not experience winter.  The high pressure water Slams against the cliff face, exposing the permafrost to the warmer air. As the soil melts, Ralph will spray it over and over, blasting away the hillside inches a day. The shallow-rooted trees on the top of the hillside will eventually fall into the excavation site, to be bulldozed away later.</p>

<p><a href="http://blog.lesterpickerphoto.com/wp-content/uploads/2011/09/LAP3287.jpg"><img class="size-medium wp-image-1570" title="_LAP3287" src="http://blog.lesterpickerphoto.com/wp-content/uploads/2011/09/LAP3287-199x300.jpg" alt="" width="199" height="300"></a></p>

<p>The monitor is counterbalanced by a bucket of discarded mining equipment, proof that a miner can run his operation on chewing gum and rubber bands.</p>

<p><a href="http://blog.lesterpickerphoto.com/wp-content/uploads/2011/09/LAP3204.jpg"><img class="size-medium wp-image-1571" title="_LAP3204" src="http://blog.lesterpickerphoto.com/wp-content/uploads/2011/09/LAP3204-199x300.jpg" alt="" width="199" height="300"></a></p>

<p>Even though he seriously undercuts the hillside, the soil will not collapse in chunks because of its high clay content and frozen state.</p>

<p><a href="http://blog.lesterpickerphoto.com/wp-content/uploads/2011/09/LAP3296.jpg"><img class="size-medium wp-image-1574" title="_LAP3296" src="http://blog.lesterpickerphoto.com/wp-content/uploads/2011/09/LAP3296-199x300.jpg" alt="" width="199" height="300"></a></p>

<p>A gold mining operation it is a dangerous place to work. As soon as I entered his claim, Ralph warned us: “I don’t have no insurance, so if you get hurt I’ll have to bury you right here.” I think that was a joke.</p>

<p>Throughout the mining camp old discards are used in practical ways, as you can see from the used barrels being used as supports. The monitor itself dates back to the period right after World War I.</p>

<p><a href="http://blog.lesterpickerphoto.com/wp-content/uploads/2011/09/LAP3280.jpg"><img class="size-medium wp-image-1572" title="_LAP3280" src="http://blog.lesterpickerphoto.com/wp-content/uploads/2011/09/LAP3280-300x199.jpg" alt="" width="300" height="199"></a></p>

<p>The muddy water runs downhill to a series of holding ponds that allow the silt to settle out before being returned to the watershed. Environmental studies conflict on whether and how much this deteriorates water quality, but there is little dispute about its effects on the land. Since the late 1980s, miners have to implement a land reclamation process to ensure that the land is returned to prior use standards. This next image shows an unrestored mining area from the early 20th century that is nonetheless restoring itself. The piles of stone are called tailings, and they were left in giant heaps as immense  dredges scoured the creeks for gold. These tailings snake through the landscape for miles. But the dredging was necessary to remove the top-layer of soil and gravel to get to the layer where gold particles could be found.</p>

<p><a href="http://blog.lesterpickerphoto.com/wp-content/uploads/2011/09/LAP3188.jpg"><img class="size-medium wp-image-1573" title="_LAP3188" src="http://blog.lesterpickerphoto.com/wp-content/uploads/2011/09/LAP3188-199x300.jpg" alt="" width="199" height="300"></a></p>

<p>Gold, being some 19 times denser than water, will sink as the water runs downhill and Ralph later dredges it up and brings it to a sluice, where he rinses it again to remove the gold from the silt.</p>

<p>How profitable is Yukon gold mining today? No reputable miner will ever tell you. But Ralph, for example, is able to fly to Mexico for the winter and also managed to take a cruise through the Panama Canal last year, something he has wanted to do for decades.</p>

<p>So, if you’re willing to endure long hours, tedium, hard work and loneliness, come to the Yukon and stake a claim. There’s still gold in them thar hills.</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>Today Richard Hartmier and I left Eagle Plains for the drive back to Dawson City. It was another long day of driving and photographing, but it seems like every turn in the road brings another spectacular vista&#8230; even the road itself.</p>

<p><a href="http://blog.lesterpickerphoto.com/wp-content/uploads/2011/09/LAP3121.jpg"><img class="aligncenter size-medium wp-image-1555" title="_LAP3121" src="http://blog.lesterpickerphoto.com/wp-content/uploads/2011/09/LAP3121-300x200.jpg" alt="" width="300" height="200"></a></p>

<p>At the northern part of our drive the Fall red colors have begun to develop.</p>

<p><a href="http://blog.lesterpickerphoto.com/wp-content/uploads/2011/09/LAP2935.jpg"><img class="aligncenter size-medium wp-image-1556" title="_LAP2935" src="http://blog.lesterpickerphoto.com/wp-content/uploads/2011/09/LAP2935-300x199.jpg" alt="" width="300" height="199"></a></p>

<p>We stopped along the Ogilvie River for what was supposed to be a quick photo session.</p>

<p><a href="http://blog.lesterpickerphoto.com/wp-content/uploads/2011/09/LAP3077.jpg"><img class="aligncenter size-medium wp-image-1557" title="_LAP3077" src="http://blog.lesterpickerphoto.com/wp-content/uploads/2011/09/LAP3077-199x300.jpg" alt="" width="199" height="300"></a></p>

<p>But one of Richard&#8217;s most trusted lenses developed a light leak, so we stayed for a while testing it to find out the cause.</p>

<p>Onward, and with the last light of day quickly disappearing behind ominous clouds, we stopped at a pond to take in the reflections in the surrounding mountains (remember to click on the images to enlarge them).</p>

<p><a href="http://blog.lesterpickerphoto.com/wp-content/uploads/2011/09/LAP3152.jpg"><img class="aligncenter size-medium wp-image-1559" title="_LAP3152" src="http://blog.lesterpickerphoto.com/wp-content/uploads/2011/09/LAP3152-300x199.jpg" alt="" width="300" height="199"></a></p>

<p>Within minutes of taking this image, the weather went south on us, as did we. We continued south to Dawson City under black clouds and rain, but we did see some gorgeous scenery and even had a chance to capture some &#8220;keepable&#8221; images.</p>

<p>Tomorrow we take off from Dawson to the Dempster to explore its lower section more. We&#8217;re hoping for great weather to make up for yesterday. Remember that you can follow us live, nearly step by step, on <a href="http://share.findmespot.com/shared/faces/viewspots.jsp?glId=0kZSlrkmUT5roDXDQ9VAGrsoTydOkgGEl">my SPOT site</a>.

  <div class="entry-content"><p>There are good days and there are bad days. And then there are days like today.</p>

<p>The day started out poorly, as inclement weather kept us grounded until just before lunch. The skies began to clear and we sailed north along the Dempster Highway, tracking reports of grizzly bear sightings near the border with North West Territory. Along the way we stopped for some landscape images right at the Arctic Circle (click on the images to enlarge).</p>

<p><a href="http://blog.lesterpickerphoto.com/wp-content/uploads/2011/09/LAP2882.jpg"><img class="aligncenter size-medium wp-image-1544" title="_LAP2882" src="http://blog.lesterpickerphoto.com/wp-content/uploads/2011/09/LAP2882-199x300.jpg" alt="" width="199" height="300"></a></p>

<p>Proceeding north from there, we didn’t have to wait long before we sighted a gorgeous grizzly specimen. This was one well-fed brute, but his markings were also particularly beautiful, with a striking black stripe down his spine, light fur and a pronounced hump. We stopped and began to photograph him, even though he was quite a distance away. Our hope was that he would continue to graze on berries and dig up roots and work his way closer to us. It took two hours before he came close enough to us for some great images.</p>

<p><a href="http://blog.lesterpickerphoto.com/wp-content/uploads/2011/09/LAP_5673.jpg"><img class="aligncenter size-medium wp-image-1545" title="LAP_5673" src="http://blog.lesterpickerphoto.com/wp-content/uploads/2011/09/LAP_5673-300x200.jpg" alt="" width="300" height="200"></a></p>

<p>Inquisitive, at one point he warily stood up to sniff us, not more than 25 feet from us. At this point he was considerably taller than either of us.</p>

<p><a href="http://blog.lesterpickerphoto.com/wp-content/uploads/2011/09/LAP_5591.jpg"><img class="aligncenter size-medium wp-image-1546" title="LAP_5591" src="http://blog.lesterpickerphoto.com/wp-content/uploads/2011/09/LAP_5591-199x300.jpg" alt="" width="199" height="300"></a></p>

<p>Now I was getting a bit anxious. Bears usually have a goodly fear of humans, especially when they see us in advance. But this bear was getting a bit too close. I got my bear spray out of the holder, just to be on the safe side.</p>

<p>Just then a passing RV spooked him and he ran away and crossed the road about 50 yards from us. He resumed his feast, all the while ambling closer and closer to us. By now Richard Hartmier, a fellow pro photographer, and I were shooting frantically. Still he came, creeping closer, head bowed and shoulders down, as would a large feline.</p>

<p><a href="http://blog.lesterpickerphoto.com/wp-content/uploads/2011/09/LAP_5641.jpg"><img class="aligncenter size-medium wp-image-1547" title="LAP_5641" src="http://blog.lesterpickerphoto.com/wp-content/uploads/2011/09/LAP_5641-200x300.jpg" alt="" width="200" height="300"></a></p>

<p>Finally, we could wait no longer. We backed away, but he kept on advancing to within ten feet and we were forced to leave our tripods, cameras and long lenses and jump into the car.</p>

<p>My heart sank to my stomach as I watched him tip over my tripod with one little swat of his huge paws. He sniffed at it, totally ignoring us as we screamed at him. I pointed my bear spray, but did not press the trigger. After all, the damage had already been done and now he was doing what bears do and that is to explore.</p>

<p>He dragged my $10,000 rig to the side of the road and began to eat the foam on my tripod legs. I suspected my brand new Nikon lens was now a doorstop and the camera a paperweight, but he would not leave, so I gave a quick spritz of the pepper spray. He sniffed the air and when he sensed the sting in his nostrils, he left immediately.</p>

<p>In the meantime, Richard had also gotten out of the vehicle and very, very carefully took some shots of the bear near my photo rig. The bear wandered away nonchalantly.</p>

<p><a href="http://blog.lesterpickerphoto.com/wp-content/uploads/2011/09/RMH9281.jpg"><img class="size-medium wp-image-1548" title="_RMH9281" src="http://blog.lesterpickerphoto.com/wp-content/uploads/2011/09/RMH9281-300x212.jpg" alt="" width="300" height="212"></a></p>

<p>With much trepidation, I examined my gear. The lens was in perfect working order, even after having survived a 6-foot fall onto the hard-packed gravel road. My camera had a minor injury; the battery compartment door had snapped off from the impact. A little duct tape later and it worked just fine.</p>

<p><a href="http://blog.lesterpickerphoto.com/wp-content/uploads/2011/09/RMH9297.jpg"><img class="size-medium wp-image-1549 " title="_RMH9297" src="http://blog.lesterpickerphoto.com/wp-content/uploads/2011/09/RMH9297-300x200.jpg" alt="" width="300" height="200"></a></p>

<p>With that established we did what any other self-respecting photographer would do, and that was to continue to photograph this magnificent animal, which we did for another hour or so.</p>

<p>Just a couple of final remarks. First, Richard and I never felt in danger and we continuously checked with each other to be sure we were in agreement on that score. The bear did not appear to be aggressive at any point and after tracking it for three hours, we felt that we saw enough of its natural behavior to be alerted if it became aggressive. In fact, right after it chewed on my tripod, it immediately began to dig roots from the roadbed. Richard has lived in the Yukon most of his life and is experienced photographing bear. Besides, he’s slower than I, so I probably felt more secure than he did.</p>

<p>Finally, hats off to Nikon. Their pro line is durable, that’s for sure. Also, a big nod to the folks at Really Right Stuff. The tripod ball head they make is widely considered the best in the industry. It held the camera fast, which is a major reason I feel the camera and lens did not shatter. Add “bear-proof” to your list of features, guys.</p>

<p>Oh, one more thing… bear spray works!</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>Well, today has been a l-o-n-g day of photography. <a href="http://www.hartmier.com">Richard Hartmier</a> and I spent the night at the Downtown Hotel in Dawson City, had a 6:00 AM breakfast and were on the road before 7 in order to get to a beaver pond by 8:30 to record their winter preparations before they went to sleep for the day.</p>

<h3>Frustrations</h3>


<p>That’s when we encountered our first frustration. The pond was lightly frozen over (remember, today is August 31!) with a few small holes indicating where the beavers had recently surfaced, but there were no signs of the beaver families. Strike one. However, we did take some landscape images at the pond, so it was not a total waste. I’ll share some of these experimental images with you in a future blog… I’ll need your feedback!</p>

<p>We continued to the Tombstone valley overlook, which I had eagerly anticipated because that would be the first time on this trip that I’d get to use my 4x5 view camera. The day was crisp and clear, the sun was shining, but there was nary a cloud in the sky and the tundra plants had not yet turned into their Fall colors due to the enormous amounts of rain in the Yukon over this summer. The vista, which is normally strikingly rich, with lots of depth, was flat and uninteresting. I never even set up my camera. Strike two.</p>

<h3>Landscapes</h3>


<p>With two strikes against us, we were eager to hit some home runs… and we did. As we drove due north, we managed some interesting landscape images.</p>

<p><a href="http://blog.lesterpickerphoto.com/wp-content/uploads/2011/09/LAP2748.jpg"><img class="size-medium wp-image-1531" title="_LAP2748" src="http://blog.lesterpickerphoto.com/wp-content/uploads/2011/09/LAP2748-300x199.jpg" alt="" width="300" height="199"></a></p>

<p>We also stopped at Two Moose Pond, not expecting to find any moose, since a few weeks ago a group of First Nations hunters had shot two moose at the pond, in front of shocked tourists.</p>

<h3>Of Moose and Bears</h3>


<p>We hung around taking some landscape images, and suddenly, there was a cow and calf in the distance, the first to repopulate the lush pond environment. Unfortunately we weren’t able to get close, but I did manage a few shots using a Nikkor 500mm lens and 1.4 teleconverter on a Nikon D300 body.</p>

<p><a href="http://blog.lesterpickerphoto.com/wp-content/uploads/2011/09/LAP_5371.jpg"><img class="size-medium wp-image-1532" title="LAP_5371" src="http://blog.lesterpickerphoto.com/wp-content/uploads/2011/09/LAP_5371-300x199.jpg" alt="" width="300" height="199"></a></p>

<p>Later we spotted a black bear with a light coat, which the locals call a cinnamon bear. We followed it for a bit, but noticed that he was stressed and wanted us gone. We quickly complied, as black bears are generally more aggressive than grizzlies.</p>

<p><a href="http://blog.lesterpickerphoto.com/wp-content/uploads/2011/09/LAP_54021.jpg"><img class="size-medium wp-image-1534" title="LAP_5402" src="http://blog.lesterpickerphoto.com/wp-content/uploads/2011/09/LAP_54021-300x200.jpg" alt="" width="300" height="200"></a></p>

<p>The temperatures reached 62F, an absolutely sweltering day in the Yukon at this time of year. We continued up the rutted, gravel-and-dirt road, stopping every so often for more images.</p>

<p><a href="http://blog.lesterpickerphoto.com/wp-content/uploads/2011/09/LAP2796.jpg"><img class="size-medium wp-image-1540" title="_LAP2796" src="http://blog.lesterpickerphoto.com/wp-content/uploads/2011/09/LAP2796-300x199.jpg" alt="" width="300" height="199"></a></p>

<p>But the time was getting away from us, so we made a pact to not stop unless both of us declared it a strikingly, amazingly, impossible-to-pass-up photo opp. Of course that occurred every kilometer or two. We had no time for lunch. Then again there is only one commercial establishment on the Dempster and we were hours away by mid afternoon.</p>

<p><a href="http://blog.lesterpickerphoto.com/wp-content/uploads/2011/09/LAP27701.jpg"><img class="size-medium wp-image-1536" title="_LAP2770" src="http://blog.lesterpickerphoto.com/wp-content/uploads/2011/09/LAP27701-300x199.jpg" alt="" width="300" height="199"></a></p>

<h3>A Weather Phenom</h3>


<p>We finally rolled into Eagle Plains, checked into the only motel/restaurant and had dinner around 5. In 30 minutes we headed north again for the Arctic Circle and the North West Territory border, we there had been numerous grizzly sightings during the day. Strike three on that score, but we did encounter one of the most unusual weather phenomenon I’ve ever seen. If any of you readers know anything about this, please add your comment to this blog. Stretched across the open tundra landscape was a wall of cloud like none other in my experience.</p>

<p><a href="http://blog.lesterpickerphoto.com/wp-content/uploads/2011/09/LAP2807.jpg"><img class="size-medium wp-image-1537" title="_LAP2807" src="http://blog.lesterpickerphoto.com/wp-content/uploads/2011/09/LAP2807-300x199.jpg" alt="" width="300" height="199"></a></p>

<p>It was a dense roll, an immense wall, almost frightening in its beauty. This band did not move, but changed shape as we watched. From below the cloud, dense fog spewed out in regular waves, carrying with it high winds.</p>

<p>Richard has experience with such things and we decided to drive into the fog. The winds buffeted our SUV and we finally made it to the North West Territory border where we could hardly see a hundred yards in front of us. The wind at this point was howling. As we turned around, we snapped a few pictures of the Welcome to the Yukon sign.</p>

<p><a href="http://blog.lesterpickerphoto.com/wp-content/uploads/2011/09/LAP2823.jpg"><img class="size-medium wp-image-1538" title="_LAP2823" src="http://blog.lesterpickerphoto.com/wp-content/uploads/2011/09/LAP2823-300x199.jpg" alt="" width="300" height="199"></a></p>

<p>Perhaps ten kilometers down the road the sun began to set and we pulled over, still in high winds, to record it. The only way to describe what we witnessed was to use the trite expression that the sky was on fire. You judge for yourself from this next image- straight out of my camera and untouched- how accurate that description was.</p>

<p><a href="http://blog.lesterpickerphoto.com/wp-content/uploads/2011/09/LAP_5430.jpg"><img class="size-medium wp-image-1539" title="LAP_5430" src="http://blog.lesterpickerphoto.com/wp-content/uploads/2011/09/LAP_5430-300x199.jpg" alt="" width="300" height="199"></a></p>

<p>This image was from just one portion of the sky. By now it was after 10:00 PM and we doubled back to the Eagle Plains Motel, rolling in around midnight, utterly exhausted, but thrilled by a full day of photographing our natural world in all its glory.</p>

<p>Once in Whitehorse I got to meet several of Richard’s friends and colleagues, especially an incredible artist in Dawson City named Romy Jansen. For years I’ve admired her fine art of aboriginal scenes and once even offered to buy one of her paintings from a restaurant in Whitehorse. I had no idea who she was but, as it turns out, she is a good friend of <a href="http://www.hartmier.com">Richard Hartmier</a> (my photo colleague).</p>

<p>Romy runs <strong>Wild &amp; Wooly</strong>, an eclectic and classy women’s boutique in Dawson. As if those two skills weren’t enough, Romy is also a truly excellent wildlife and landscape photographer, selling her work on gift cards in her store.</p>

<p>Tonight we were hoping to get some Northern Lights to photograph, but the major prediction websites give us little (actually, zero) hope. So, instead we’ll crash early tonight and get an early start up the <a href="http://www.mopedtrip.com/dempster/index.html">Dempster Highway</a>, so we can photograph a family of beavers just after sunrise and then focus on landscape shots for the rest of the day. After a short evening nap, we plan to shoot Northern Lights at the Arctic Circle tomorrow night starting at midnight, but that depends on factors beyond our control. But how can one complain when we passed scenic after glorious scenic, like this panorama I did of Gravel Lake along the way today.</p>

<p>Over the next few days we also hope to get some images of grizzlies and caribou. Please send out good vibrations for good lights and good images… thanks.</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>I’m back in <a href="http://blog.lesterpickerphoto.com/2011/02/13/whitehorse-yukon-gateway-to-the-north/">Whitehorse</a>, the capital of Yukon Territory, recharging my batteries, cleaning my equipment, doing laundry and running assorted errands before leaving for the Dempster Highway again to photograph the Fall colors and Northern Lights (hopefully). I thought it would be good to review with you the past week’s photo shoot and some things I learned from the experience.</p>

<p>For those of you following my progress on <a href="http://share.findmespot.com/shared/faces/viewspots.jsp?glId=0kZSlrkmUT5roDXDQ9VAGrsoTydOkgGEl">my interactive SPOT geo-tracking page</a>, it will be inactive for the next two days. On Tuesday, my fellow photographer, <a href="http://www.hartmier.com">Richard Hartmier</a> and I will leave for <a href="http://blog.lesterpickerphoto.com/2011/02/10/dawson-city-or-bust/">historic Dawson City</a>. Just before we go I’ll re-post the link to my SPOT site.</p>

<p>The first thing I re-learned from my week with Richard is how much fun it can be photographing with another passionate professional. Perhaps 90% of the time I prefer to photograph alone, communing with nature as much as photographing. But when I find someone who I can share my passion and dedication with, it is rewarding in itself. Richard and I banter and tease throughout our shoots, but underlying it all is a respect for each other’s body of work. In fact, one amateur photographer we met over the three days summed up our friendship after hearing us razz each other.</p>

<p>“You two are friends… aren’t you?”</p>

<p>Frankly, I struggled to get decent results with my new Nikon 200-400mm VR lens. My first day’s shots lacked crystal clarity, something that other photographers have reported. I finally took a colleague’s (Thom Hogan) recommendation and removed the protective clear glass from the front of the lens and that made a difference. That’s a risky practice with a $7,500 lens, but if I can’t get the results I need, that investment immediately becomes a doorstop.</p>

<p><a href="http://blog.lesterpickerphoto.com/wp-content/uploads/2011/08/LAP_5284.jpg"><img class="size-medium wp-image-1508" title="LAP_5284" src="http://blog.lesterpickerphoto.com/wp-content/uploads/2011/08/LAP_5284-200x300.jpg" alt="" width="200" height="300"></a></p>

<p>I also tried a Nikon 500mm, manual focus lens, but had difficulty adjusting to its quirks, after just having used my 200-400. That was entirely my fault. The lens is capable of giving tack sharp results. I told myself that I needed to practice with the controls the night before in my motel room, but I had too many other things to do and never got around to it. Bad mistake. On our final morning the bear cubs were very active, wrestling and sparring with each other. I missed the entire sequence as I battled with the settings on the lens and camera. Yes, pros do such knuckle-headed things, too. Making matters much, much worse was the fact that Richard got some great images. Ouch!</p>

<p><a href="http://blog.lesterpickerphoto.com/wp-content/uploads/2011/08/LAP_5276.jpg"><img class="size-medium wp-image-1509" title="LAP_5276" src="http://blog.lesterpickerphoto.com/wp-content/uploads/2011/08/LAP_5276-199x300.jpg" alt="" width="199" height="300"></a></p>

<p>Other musings include the fact that most of the bears in this park were tagged, a good thing for biologists studying them, but bad for wildlife photographers. We also put some of our down time to good use, photographing small waterfalls and beach scenes.</p>

<p><a href="http://blog.lesterpickerphoto.com/wp-content/uploads/2011/08/LAP2386.jpg"><img class="size-medium wp-image-1511" title="_LAP2386" src="http://blog.lesterpickerphoto.com/wp-content/uploads/2011/08/LAP2386-200x300.jpg" alt="" width="200" height="300"></a></p>

<p>People often ask me what it&#8217;s like photographing wildlife. There is always a balancing act between getting the shot and risking life and limb. Bears are unpredictable creatures that can do horrific damage with one swipe of their paws. We had watched this family for two days, so I somewhat felt I had a handle on their behavior. As soon as this shot was taken by Rick Price, a Canadian pro wedding photographer and amateur wildlife shooter, I backed off. However, please note the can of bear spray in my right hand. Even after I backed off, these cubs came on land toward me. Cubs are even more unpredictable than their mothers. When they were too close for my comfort level, I raised the can of spray at them and yelled and they turned and went back into the water. Bears and humans need to have a healthy fear and respect for each other. Thanks, Rick, for those pictures.</p>

<p>But, the best thing of all is this: There is no such thing as a bad day for a nature photographer. Veteran photographer George Lepp said that and I concur. I was out there in the rain and cold, standing next to pristine glacial streams that helped carve out the majestic snow-capped mountains in the park. Perhaps I didn&#8217;t get all the images I wanted, but I felt blessed to be able to watch such magnificent animals interact with their environment as their species has done for thousands of years. It just doesn’t get much better than that.</p>
