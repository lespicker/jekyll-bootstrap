  <div class="entry-content"><p>We are in the Inuvik airport now, waiting for our flight to Tuktoyaktuk, which has been delayed at least an hour due to pea-soup fog. Thankfully, the airport has free Wifi. Knowing that you have all waited your entire lives for a tour of the Inuvik airport, I thought I&#8217;d include some shots.</p>

<p><a href="http://blog.lesterpickerphoto.com/wp-content/uploads/2011/08/LAP1400.jpg"><img class="size-medium wp-image-1432" title="_LAP1400" src="http://blog.lesterpickerphoto.com/wp-content/uploads/2011/08/LAP1400-300x199.jpg" alt="" width="300" height="199"></a></p>

<p>Inside the Terminal building there is a terrific map of the Arctic. The pink is Canadian territory. We are located at the top left of the pink area.</p>

<p><a href="http://blog.lesterpickerphoto.com/wp-content/uploads/2011/08/LAP1406.jpg"><img class="size-medium wp-image-1433" title="_LAP1406" src="http://blog.lesterpickerphoto.com/wp-content/uploads/2011/08/LAP1406-300x199.jpg" alt="" width="300" height="199"></a></p>

<p>If you want a better view of where we are in relation to the North Pole, take a gander at this video I made of the map, showing the entire circumpolar region. I try to trace our route from Whitehorse, Yukon Territory, to Dawson City, then up the Dempster Highway to Inuvik, then to Tuktoyaktuk. It&#8217;s sobering to think that, as far as we&#8217;ve come, the actual North Pole is still 2,000 miles away! Scary!!</p>

<p><a href="http://youtu.be/rXjm_hE4bYg">http://youtu.be/rXjm_hE4bYg</a></p>

<p>Also in the Terminal building is this polar bear which, by the way, was NOT killed for the making of this diorama. It was found dead on the ice and put to good biological use.</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>It’s been a long and grueling 450-mile drive up Canada’s Dempster Highway, battling rain, potholes and our RV sliding in the mud. But, we finally drove into the remote town of Inuvik, North West Territory this afternoon. The final segment of our drive found us on two ferries, one on the Peel River and the other over the McKenzie River, as we descended from the Yukon tundra to the ocean, a descent of about 3,300 feet.</p>

<p><a href="http://youtu.be/D-MZdRsaRs8">http://youtu.be/D-MZdRsaRs8</a></p>

<p>Once we crossed the McKenzie, we made a beeline to Inuvik, as interesting a town as anyone has ever seen. There is only one major shopping street, with a mix of hotels, gift shops, cafes and bars. Lots of bars, an unfortunate by-product of the difficult plight of the indigenous people worldwide.</p>

<p><a href="http://blog.lesterpickerphoto.com/wp-content/uploads/2011/08/LAP1374.jpg"><img class="size-medium wp-image-1422 " title="_LAP1374" src="http://blog.lesterpickerphoto.com/wp-content/uploads/2011/08/LAP1374-300x199.jpg" alt="" width="300" height="199"></a></p>

<p>Inuvik sits on the edge of a huge estuarine delta, and historically its people have survived with fishing and hunting. The climate is unforgiving. Today, on August 16, it might reach as high as 45F, not counting the wind chill factor.</p>

<p><a href="http://blog.lesterpickerphoto.com/wp-content/uploads/2011/08/LAP1383.jpg"><img class="size-medium wp-image-1429" title="_LAP1383" src="http://blog.lesterpickerphoto.com/wp-content/uploads/2011/08/LAP1383-300x199.jpg" alt="" width="300" height="199"></a></p>

<p>To cope with the low end of weather extreme, all houses are built on cement posts, so as not to melt the permafrost and cause the house to sink.</p>

<p><a href="http://blog.lesterpickerphoto.com/wp-content/uploads/2011/08/LAP1382.jpg"><img class="aligncenter size-medium wp-image-1427" title="_LAP1382" src="http://blog.lesterpickerphoto.com/wp-content/uploads/2011/08/LAP1382-199x300.jpg" alt="" width="199" height="300"></a></p>

<p>Water and waste must travel above ground for the same reasons, so the community has built what is known as the Utilidor, a network of above-ground corrugated metal conduits that are heavily insulated. All homes in the community are connected to this grid.</p>

<p><a href="http://blog.lesterpickerphoto.com/wp-content/uploads/2011/08/LAP1389.jpg"><img class="size-medium wp-image-1428" title="_LAP1389" src="http://blog.lesterpickerphoto.com/wp-content/uploads/2011/08/LAP1389-199x300.jpg" alt="" width="199" height="300"></a></p>

<p>Tomorrow we fly to Tuktoyaktuk to take a dip in the Beaufort Sea, part of the Arctic Ocean. The weather report calls for a temp of 23F, including the wind chill. The water temp is 29.4F (salt water freezes at a lower temp). Brrr!</p>

<p>Once again, you’ll be able to follow my progress- live- via my SPOT GPS device for the next 2 weeks at this site:</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>Yukon with friends. Can there be anything more satisfying? Well, maybe one thing; traveling in the Yukon with my wife a few years ago. Still, traveling the famed Dempster Highway with my guy friends runs a close second. We’re in the third (or is it the fourth?) day of our 11-day adventure together, the six of us celebrating 25 years of friendship with a slam-bang trip to the spectacular vistas made famous by Jack London (with credit to Sargent Preston, of course). Lots of laughing and teasing, reminisces, catching up on each others’ lives.</p>

<p>Tonight we’re camping alongside the Blackstone River, surrounded by mountains whose low-lying reddish vegetation is just beginning to show signs of approaching Fall. I looked out the window and saw that Jay caught and released the first fish of the trip. Somehow five of us managed to cook a decent meal of fish, potatoes and broccoli. We ate it together, watching the river flow swiftly by. The days are long in August in this part of the world, so we finally bed down around 11:00, with the mountains still silhouetted by the day’s retiring light. Our RVs are parked so close to the river I’m worried about them floating away if this infernal rain keeps up.</p>

<p>As it turns out we made it through the cold night still dry, but a light rain started again in early morning as we where on the road. And what a road the Dempster Highway is. Callijng it a Highway was some bureaucrat’s idea of a joke, for sure. It is a gravel road, full of constant bumps, ruts and potholes so that as you drive you feel like you are in a blender. The views are spectacular when the weather cooperates, but today we are socked in by low-lying clouds and fog. The road is muddy, so we have the added thrill of slipping and sliding in our 25-foot RV.</p>

<p>At milepost 229 (369-km), we stop for water and gas at Eagle Plains Hotel (and restaurant, gas station and small store), the only stop on the entire 450-mile highway. It’s still a long way to Inuvik, which is the end of the highway in summer. During the winter, the road continues as an ice road all the way to Tuktoyaktuk on the Beaufort Sea (part if the Arctic Ocean). Our plan is to reach Inuvik and take a puddle jumper to Tuk, as the locals call it. There- you guessed it- our troupe will take a celebratory dip into the frigid ocean! (For those of you women reading this, it’s a guy thing).</p>

<p><a href="http://blog.lesterpickerphoto.com/wp-content/uploads/2011/08/LAP13002.jpg"><img class="size-medium wp-image-1414" title="_LAP1300" src="http://blog.lesterpickerphoto.com/wp-content/uploads/2011/08/LAP13002-300x199.jpg" alt="" width="300" height="199"></a></p>

<p>Once our guy-cation is done, I’ll spend another 10 days in Yukon intensely photographing. On the agenda are grizzlies feeding on salmon, Northern lights and some pristine landscape images.</p>

<p>My next post will be in a few days, after we reach Tuk. So, please stay tuned.  In the meantime you can <a href="http://share.findmespot.com/shared/faces/viewspots.jsp?glId=0kZSlrkmUT5roDXDQ9VAGrsoTydOkgGEl">follow my progress on a live, interactive map by clicking here</a>.</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>Baltimore, Maryland, USA, to Toronto, Canada to Vancouver to Whitehorse, Yukon Territory. I tired, but excited to be back here. After a short night&#8217;s sleep, I&#8217;m taking off with 5 of my long-time friends for the first leg of the Yukon journey. For ten days I&#8217;ll take my group from Whitehorse to the Arctic Ocean in 2 rented RVs. Once they head back home, I&#8217;ll go on a 2-week photography odyssey with my colleague Richard Hartmier, a professional Yukon photographer.</p>

<p><a href="http://blog.lesterpickerphoto.com/wp-content/uploads/2011/08/2008-Yukon-Dawson-City-332008-09-19-1.jpg"><img src="http://blog.lesterpickerphoto.com/wp-content/uploads/2011/08/2008-Yukon-Dawson-City-332008-09-19-1-300x199.jpg" alt="" title="Northen lights over Yukon River, Dawson City, Yukon, Canada" width="300" height="199" class="aligncenter size-medium wp-image-1405"></a></p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>Tomorrow I leave again for Canada&#8217;s Yukon Territory, my second trip up there this year. When I visited in February the temperature was minus 40F, so I&#8217;m in hopes that this trip will be a bit warmer.</p>

<p>Those of you who read my blog know that I have a love affair with the Yukon, with its abundance of wildlife, mind-blowing scenics and friendly people. With a land mass 20% larger than California&#8217;s, the Yukon has 30,000 residents, compared to California&#8217;s 33,000,000. Since 24,000 of Yukon&#8217;s residents live in the capital city of Whitehorse, that leaves 6,000 people to share the land with 30,000 bear, 60,000 moose and hundreds of thousands of caribou and elk.</p>

<p><a href="http://blog.lesterpickerphoto.com/wp-content/uploads/2011/08/northernlights1.jpg"><img src="http://blog.lesterpickerphoto.com/wp-content/uploads/2011/08/northernlights1-199x300.jpg" alt="" title="northernlights1" width="199" height="300" class="size-medium wp-image-1395"></a></p>

<p>On this trip I&#8217;ll be trying a new high-tech solution. If you want to follow my travels on a map, I will be  sending my &#8220;tracks&#8221; to a SPOT GPS device. On my first blog from the Yukon on Saturday, Aug 13, I&#8217;ll leave a direct link embedded in the blog. You simply click on that and a map will open up showing you where I am in real time. Pretty nifty, eh? Plus, on the upper right hand side of the map, you can change the view from road, to terrain to satellite, allowing you to see the contours of the land.</p>

<p>I&#8217;ll also be posting some short, 1-minute videos at various locales, including on a 3-day Grizzly bear photo shoot near the end of the month. So, stay tuned and visit here often during the trip.</p>

<p>Have a wonderful remainder of the summer.</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>Allow me to digress a bit here, away from photography and into the not too distant past. I just spent the weekend with family in the Boston area and had an opportunity to visit Concord, Massachusetts, a picturesque New England town. It is here that the &#8220;shots heard &#8216;round the world&#8221; were fired and here that the great liberal thinkers of America gathered to debate the great themes and to write the works that defined the American literary scene.</p>

<h3>The Shot Heard Round the World</h3>


<p>So, moving chronologically, I visited The Manse, the home of Ralph Waldo Emerson, and at one point rented out to his friend Nathaniel Hawthorne and his new wife.</p>

<p><a href="http://blog.lesterpickerphoto.com/wp-content/uploads/2011/08/photo.jpg"><img class="size-medium wp-image-1383" title="photo" src="http://blog.lesterpickerphoto.com/wp-content/uploads/2011/08/photo-300x225.jpg" alt="" width="300" height="225"></a></p>

<p>From the upstairs bedroom, Emerson&#8217;s father and grandfather looked out their back field and saw a group of farmers on the far bank of the stream, facing off against a contingent of British Redcoats on the near side. The day was April 19, 1775. To their horror, they were witness to the first battle of the Revolutionary War, the Battle of Concord and Lexington, immortalized in Emerson&#8217;s poem, <a href="http://www.nationalcenter.org/ConcordHymn.html">Concord Hymn</a>.</p>

<p>Standing in that bedroom with my wife and granddaughter, I couldn&#8217;t get out of my mind the obvious futility of that action. Who in their right mind would have given even million-to-one odds of those brave men succeeding? Who could have even conceived of a band of simple men and their intelligentsia fellow Brits (technically they were all British citizens) sustaining a revolution that would go on to defeat the mightiest nation on Earth? I chocked up at the thought.</p>

<p>I took a few video segments this weekend with my trusty iPod Touch. Here is one showing the monument erected in 1836, for which Emerson wrote &#8220;Concord Hymn &#8221; and coined that iconic phrase. As I panned from the monument to the river beyond, I could imagine the ragtag farmers armed with their crude muskets, facing the well-trained British soldiers.</p>

<iframe width="560" height="349" src="http://www.youtube.com/embed/oadeWYHr-Fw" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen></iframe>


<p>Now look at this short clip of the monument to the British soldiers who died that day. Note toward the end, as I pan over the marker, you can see Emerson&#8217;s house (The Manse) in the background.</p>

<iframe width="560" height="349" src="http://www.youtube.com/embed/ZVzrkOx5_qE" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen></iframe>


<h3>Sleeping Hollow Cemetery</h3>


<p>Later that day we walked from Concord&#8217;s picture-perfect public square to the Sleeping Hollow Cemetery, where the American literary nobility lay buried. We visited the graves of Emerson, Louisa May Alcott, Nathanial Hawthorne and Henry Thoreau. The cemetery itself is beautiful and well maintained, with rolling hills and walking paths. But seeing the graves of these literary giants brought lumps to our throats.</p>

<p>Most humbling, to me anyway, were the testimonial notes left by other visitors. I teared up reading some of them. One young girl, still struggling with her spelling and grammar, praised Alcott for writing some of her favorite books. An older man left a touching note thanking Thoreau for launching him on a lifelong love of nature. Admittedly, that one broke the dam for me.</p>

<iframe width="560" height="349" src="http://www.youtube.com/embed/kMpeH1XBJD4" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen></iframe>


<p>This was a family outing. I chose not to have a camera with me, just my iPod. But, I guarantee you those precious memories will stay with me as long as any photographic image.</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>After months of behind-the-scenes development work, I&#8217;m proud to announce the launch of my first photography eBook.</p>

<p>In <em><strong><a href="http://blog.lesterpickerphoto.com/ebook/">The Photographer’s Eye: Landscapes 1</a></strong></em>, I&#8217;ll take you behind the scenes where I showcase some of my techniques and the thinking that goes into professional compositions. You will gain insights into the photographic process as I explain how each of ten, specially chosen stunning images was made, what I had to overcome to get the shot and how I tackled familiar and unique lighting challenges to bring home these highly praised photos.</p>

<p><a href="http://blog.lesterpickerphoto.com/wp-content/uploads/2011/08/landscape-ebook-cover-jpg1.jpg"><img class="aligncenter size-medium wp-image-1371" title="landscape ebook cover-jpg" src="http://blog.lesterpickerphoto.com/wp-content/uploads/2011/08/landscape-ebook-cover-jpg1-300x241.jpg" alt="" width="300" height="241"></a></p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>Histograms! Sounds like a medical procedure or, worse yet, mathematics.</p>

<p>Well, if you’re a photographer, histograms are your friends. Don’t be intimidated by them. Learn how to use a histogram and your images will dramatically improve.</p>

<h3>What Is a Histogram?</h3>


<p>In digital photography a histogram is an electronic display of all the pixels, light-to-dark, recorded on the sensor when you press the shutter release. It appears as a graph on the rear LCD screen in DSLR cameras and even on many point-and-shoots, such as the Canon G12.</p>

<p>There is really no such thing as a good or bad histogram, as I’ve read online and heard people say. A histogram simply is. And that’s why it is such a great tool. It only records the facts and presents it to you in easy-to-understand fashion. It is up to you to understand what it is telling you and then use that information to improve the image.</p>

<h3>A Balanced Example</h3>


<p>In the following image I took, you’ll notice that the distribution of the light is pretty even. Yes, there are some bright spots and deep shadows, but nothing glaringly bad about the image’s appearance. Just looking at the light in the image, it appears pretty well balanced.</p>

<p><a href="http://blog.lesterpickerphoto.com/wp-content/uploads/2011/07/CanadianRockies2009-3032009-10-05.jpg"><img class="size-medium wp-image-1338" title="CanadianRockies2009 3032009-10-05" src="http://blog.lesterpickerphoto.com/wp-content/uploads/2011/07/CanadianRockies2009-3032009-10-05-300x199.jpg" alt="" width="300" height="199"></a></p>

<p>Now look at the histogram for this image.</p>

<p><a href="http://blog.lesterpickerphoto.com/wp-content/uploads/2011/07/wedgepondhisto.jpg"><img class="size-full wp-image-1339" title="wedgepondhisto" src="http://blog.lesterpickerphoto.com/wp-content/uploads/2011/07/wedgepondhisto.jpg" alt="" width="296" height="174"></a></p>

<p>The graph represents the distribution of pixels from dark on the left side of the histogram to lighter pixels as we head to the right. You will note that none of the pixels are knocking into the “wall” at the far left or right. That indicates that the image is not overexposed or underexposed. Overexposed pixels would be stacked high up against the far right wall. That means that one could not discern any details in those highlights. They would appear white and featureless. On the other hand, underexposed pixels would crowd up against the far left wall. No details would be discernable in those black areas.</p>

<h3>Underexposed</h3>


<p>Take this next image, for example.</p>

<p><a href="http://blog.lesterpickerphoto.com/wp-content/uploads/2011/07/West-Maui-Mountains-575.jpg"><img class="size-medium wp-image-1340" title="West Maui 575" src="http://blog.lesterpickerphoto.com/wp-content/uploads/2011/07/West-Maui-Mountains-575-199x300.jpg" alt="" width="199" height="300"></a></p>

<p>You can see that the image has many dark black, featureless areas where you cannot see any details in the darkest shadows. Actually, that was intentional on my part. I wanted to silhouette that rock on the right and put the emphasis on the sunset, the water and the mid-range rocks. Note the histogram:</p>

<p><a href="http://blog.lesterpickerphoto.com/wp-content/uploads/2011/07/hawaii-histo.tiff"><img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-1341" title="hawaii-histo" src="http://blog.lesterpickerphoto.com/wp-content/uploads/2011/07/hawaii-histo.tiff" alt=""></a></p>

<p>Pixels are bumped up against the far left wall. In this case I didn’t mind at all. But, if I had wanted to get some details in the shadows on the right, I would have opened up my aperture perhaps 2/3 or one full f-stop. Alternately, I could have just left the shutter open a bit longer to allow in more light. My point here is that the histogram only gives you data. It’s up to you to make decisions based on it.</p>

<h3>Overexposed</h3>


<p>One of the most dreaded results in photography is when you have horribly overexposed areas in an image. We refer to those areas as blown-out highlights. The best way to come home with a well-balanced image is to take a test shot, look at the histogram and check to see if the graph slams into the right side of the wall. If it does, you have blown-out highlights somewhere in the image. Sometimes you will want some blown-out highlights to achieve a certain effect, but most of the time you’ll want to change the aperture or exposure to minimize those overexposed areas.</p>

<p>Look at the following image. Notice that it is waaay overexposed. No doubt about it, a very bad shot. The highlights are &#8220;blown,&#8221; meaning that you cannot discern any details in the lightest areas, even though there were some nice clouds above the mountain. The whole area is featureless.</p>

<p><a href="http://blog.lesterpickerphoto.com/wp-content/uploads/2011/07/Costa-Rica2010_2010-05-21_2257%C2%A9LesterPicker.jpg"><img class="size-medium wp-image-1343" title="Costa Rica2010_2010-05-21_2257©LesterPicker" src="http://blog.lesterpickerphoto.com/wp-content/uploads/2011/07/Costa-Rica2010_2010-05-21_2257%C2%A9LesterPicker-200x300.jpg" alt="" width="200" height="300"></a></p>

<p>Let’s look at its histogram:</p>

<p><a href="http://blog.lesterpickerphoto.com/wp-content/uploads/2011/07/costaricahisto1.jpg"><img class="size-medium wp-image-1344" title="costaricahisto" src="http://blog.lesterpickerphoto.com/wp-content/uploads/2011/07/costaricahisto1-300x174.jpg" alt="" width="300" height="174"></a></p>

<p>Ouch!! Even pros make mistakes. Here you can see that the pixels are piled up on the right wall, indicating overexposure. No choice here but to re-shoot. I’d have to close down my aperture two or three stops or increase the shutter speed a good deal to let in far less light. But in other cases I might have some blown pixels in the image and be happy with the results. Like I said, histograms just are.</p>

<p>The beauty of digital is that you can shoot again and again, look at your histogram (and the LCD preview image) and decide when you’ve nailed the shot. Combined with the image you see on your LCD screen, using your histogram can result in far better images.</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>In Search Of the perfect ISO for your photographic efforts? So many amateur photographers I meet are confused about what the ISO means and how to best tune it to their imaging needs. I thought I’d give a brief primer here on the topic.</p>

<h3>Just What Is ISO?</h3>


<p>ISO is equivalent to what we called ASA during film days. ISO is a measure of how sensitive a sensor is to light. The higher the ISO, the better its ability to record light, but the ‘grainier’ the image looks. There’s always a trade-off, isn’t there? Sometimes you want that grainy effect; most of the time in landscape photography you won’t. In digital photography we refer to that grain as ‘noise.’ Noise is most prominent in the shadow areas of the image. Also, as you blow up the image beyond a print size of 8 x 10, the noise becomes more apparent.</p>

<p>Take this example here.</p>

<p><a href="http://blog.lesterpickerphoto.com/wp-content/uploads/2011/07/sandhillcranes2.jpg"><img class="aligncenter size-medium wp-image-1328" title="sandhillcranes2" src="http://blog.lesterpickerphoto.com/wp-content/uploads/2011/07/sandhillcranes2-300x201.jpg" alt="" width="300" height="201"></a></p>

<p>This image is one that many of my clients enjoy. Its overall effect is pleasing. The image, taken hand-held in the northern Yukon, is of Lesser Sandhill Cranes migrating south from their summer feeding grounds in the Arctic. I took this as the sun was barely rising. That meant that there wasn’t much light, especially near ground level. Plus the birds were moving, so I had to use a fast shutter speed. The only way I could do this was to ratchet up the ISO on my digital camera to 800, some four times the recommended (baseline) ISO of 200.</p>

<p>When you magnify the image, as I’ve done below, you can see just how much grain there is in the shadow areas of the image.</p>

<p><a href="http://blog.lesterpickerphoto.com/wp-content/uploads/2011/07/Screen-shot-2011-07-27-at-6.04.58-PM.jpg"><img class="aligncenter size-medium wp-image-1329" title="Screen shot 2011-07-27 at 6.04.58 PM" src="http://blog.lesterpickerphoto.com/wp-content/uploads/2011/07/Screen-shot-2011-07-27-at-6.04.58-PM-300x224.jpg" alt="" width="300" height="224"></a></p>

<h3>Manipulating ISO</h3>


<p>The take-away is to try to keep your ISO at 200 or below when doing landscape photography, where you want everything to be sharp with no noise. Many cameras can handle up to ISO 400 or even 800 with minimal noise, but don’t count on it. Personally, I try to keep my ISO at 100-200. However, to effectively use ISO 200 or below you will almost always have to use a tripod. The lower the ISO, the lower the light sensitivity of the sensor. In other words, all other variables being equal, as you lower the ISO you must keep open the shutter for a longer period of time to allow in enough light or else open the aperture of the lens more. To prevent hand shake during exposures a tripod and cable release are critical.</p>

<p>ISO is the third major variable available to digital photographers to manipulate the capture of light, which is what photography is all about. The triad consists of shutter speed, aperture and ISO. Change any one of these and the other two will be affected. For example, in the photo above I shot the scene at f11 (aperture) at 1/320 second (shutter speed) at ISO 800. I needed to shoot at f11 to get more birds in focus, since they were scattered across the sky. I also wanted the mountain, trees and clouds to be reasonably in focus. But, at ISO 200, I would have had to shoot at 1/80 second, far too slow to freeze the birds. Truth be known I also have arthritis in my hands and as a result I can no longer hand-hold a 70-200 lens and get a decent image at 1/80.</p>

<p>So, what does an arthritic old pro do in such circumstances? If I double the ISO to 400, I can double the shutter speed to 1/160, good but still iffy for me. So, I cranked the ISO up to 800 and then I could shoot at a safe 1/320 second. Problem solved… well almost… there’s that nasty noise to deal with. Some of that noise can be reduced by special software, which I eventually did with this photo in order to enlarge it for display. In retrospect I should have taken my tripod with me on that day. That would have allowed me to shoot at ISO 400, with far less noise.</p>

<h3>Creative Use of ISO</h3>


<p>You’ve probably already figured out that there are times you’ll want to use the noise inherent in high ISOs to good effect in an image. I remember when I started out as a cub photojournalist watching one of the veteran photographers working in the darkroom and oulling from the soup an image I’ll never forget. It was an inner city corner at night with a drug dealer leaning against a post and an obvious customer talking to him. It was shot in black and white with the old Tri-X film, which was rated at ASA 400. This photographer had boosted it to ASA 1600 and the grain in the image gave a gritty feel to the scene. Perfect for the story.</p>

<p>I did the same in this image taken in Capetown, South Africa. I came across this scene as I walked the waterfront at sunrise. There was dense fog, as there often is in Capetown. From a few hundred yards away I did not even see the ship. Suddenly, it loomed large in the fog. I set up the shot and intentionally cranked up the ISO to give the image a gritty feel.</p>

<p><a href="http://blog.lesterpickerphoto.com/wp-content/uploads/2011/07/untitled-154-of-170.jpg"><img class="aligncenter size-medium wp-image-1330" title="&lt;untitled&gt; 154 of 170" src="http://blog.lesterpickerphoto.com/wp-content/uploads/2011/07/untitled-154-of-170-200x300.jpg" alt="" width="200" height="300"></a></p>

<h3>A Final Thought</h3>


<p>One final thought on high ISO settings. Some newer cameras, like my Nikon D700, can shoot at ISO 800 with virtually no noise at all. That day in the Yukon I shot with an older Nikon camera. Improvements in sensor technology has meant great leaps in quality images. Now if I can only get back to the Yukon at the right time of year and get the sun, clouds and birds to cooperate…</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>I’m all wet. I admit it. Part of my job sometimes involves getting into water up to my waist to capture a scene. But when I notice that someone with a camera is watching me, I shudder with angst that by following my example s/he might get into trouble… which prompts this blog.</p>

<p>Summertime invites water images, but taking an image while standing in water is fraught with difficulty and danger. I never, ever take such shots casually. I take prudent precautions and preparations. I always weigh the risks carefully before making a decision. Even then, I am constantly reconsidering, looking for a land-based angle, even as I’m pressing the shutter. With summer here in full force, people are more prone to try to ‘immerse’ themselves in their photography (forgive the pun… please!).</p>

<p>What I’d like to do here is give some advantages and disadvantages to shooting while in water and then offer some tips and suggestions.</p>

<h3>Advantages</h3>


<p><strong>You’re in the thick of it</strong>. Like recording a forest scene, being right in the water gives you a feel that no other vantage point can quite achieve. There is usually a sense of separation when photographing water scenes from land. The immersive experience brings your viewer right into the element.</p>

<p><a href="http://blog.lesterpickerphoto.com/wp-content/uploads/2011/07/SSP-RockRunStream.jpg"><img class="aligncenter size-medium wp-image-1321" title="SSP-RockRunStream" src="http://blog.lesterpickerphoto.com/wp-content/uploads/2011/07/SSP-RockRunStream-199x300.jpg" alt="" width="199" height="300"></a></p>

<p><strong>Unique perspectives</strong>. Often a photographer cannot quite get the right framing unless s/he steps into the water. Leaves are in the way, a branch obstructs the view, or that stream bank is too high. Getting into the water opens up new possibilities.</p>

<p><strong>Terrific foreground elements</strong>. By going into the water you can choose the scenes that give you powerful foreground elements.</p>

<p><a href="http://blog.lesterpickerphoto.com/wp-content/uploads/2011/07/Harford-County-MD-Jerusalem-Bridge-24-of-32.jpg"><img class="aligncenter size-medium wp-image-1322" title="Harford County-MD-Jerusalem Bridge 24 of 32" src="http://blog.lesterpickerphoto.com/wp-content/uploads/2011/07/Harford-County-MD-Jerusalem-Bridge-24-of-32-199x300.jpg" alt="" width="199" height="300"></a></p>

<h3>Disadvantages</h3>


<p><strong>Shooting in water can be dangerous</strong>. Think currents, waves, riptides, splashing, and slippery rocks. None of them are great for your gear or body. A few months ago my assistant, Bob, slipped on a muddy rock in a stream we were photographing and was badly hurt. I was recently bowled over by the rogue wave you see in the distance while I was in Australia taking the following image (click on image to enlarge it).  Fortunately I was able to hoist my tripod over my head and I landed on my feet on the sand. Whew! Close call.</p>

<p><a href="http://blog.lesterpickerphoto.com/wp-content/uploads/2011/07/Great-Ocean-Road-Victoria-Australia-1702010-11-11.jpg"><img class="aligncenter size-medium wp-image-1323" title="Great Ocean Road, Victoria, Australia 1702010-11-11" src="http://blog.lesterpickerphoto.com/wp-content/uploads/2011/07/Great-Ocean-Road-Victoria-Australia-1702010-11-11-300x199.jpg" alt="" width="300" height="199"></a></p>

<p><strong>Water hides a multitude of evils</strong>. Water holes can hide deep drop-offs. You’ll be wading one moment and literally with the next step find the water above your head. Not a good thing to happen when you’re holding a fortune in gear. Water can also hide creepy-crawly bad things. In North Carolina I once had a cottonmouth glide by me. My most serious bear encounter occurred when I was photographing in a shallow stream for an hour. I did not notice the bear grazing on shore just fifteen feet from me. Nor did he notice me until I stood up. Fortunately he was more interested in the berries.</p>

<p><strong>Moving water carries debris</strong>. These objects, from barrels to logs, can knock you off your feet or topple your tripod.</p>

<h3>My Tips</h3>


<p><strong>Be physically fit</strong>. That includes having good balance, even practicing balance on a ski board or one of those ball and tray devices you find in a gym. Also, cold water can be a shock to the system, so make sure you are cardiac healthy.</p>

<p><strong>Wear great shoes</strong>. Note, I do not say good shoes. If I’m going to do water shots, I wear either high quality soft-rubber bottomed, high boots (I use Muck Boots) for shallow water in creeks or else serious water shoes (hard to beat my Keen’s). If I know I’ll be in knee-deep to waist-deep water, I’ll go with my dependable, rugged Orvis waders.</p>

<p><strong>Keep your feet under you</strong>. Balance is everything in water. Currents and wave action can pull your feet from under you. Do not over-step. Take small steps, recover your balance and then take another. Feel the rocks under your feet before putting down all your weight.  I call it the water shuffle.</p>

<p><strong>Wear quick-drying clothing</strong>. When I know I’ll be shooting in water, I use quick drying fabrics, even down to my underwear (Ex Officio is great).</p>

<p><strong>Bring a change of clothes</strong>. This is a tricky one, since if you backpack to a spot you want to minimize gear. I only do this if I suspect I’ll need to dip into a stream in Fall or winter where I’m concerned about hypothermia. If I do wade into a winter stream, I almost always use my waders, which keep me warm and dry.</p>

<p><strong>Use a tripod</strong>. Mount your camera on a tripod and extend the legs far enough to be well above the water line <em>and</em> the splash zone. Use a shutter release, too. Chances are if you’re shooting in a stream the overhead canopy will cause more shade and require you to use a slower shutter speed anyway. That’s good for smoothing the flow of water, too. At times I will use my tripod legs to test water in front of me for drop-offs. Also, if you do take a spill while photographing, your camera gear will remain dry.</p>

<p><strong>Perform a bend-over test</strong>. Not to make a pun, but one of the things that gives me a sinking feeling is when I’m bent over my camera and tripod and realize that my focus loop, or my hand meter or something else that is dangling from my neck or waist is now below water. Nowadays I do a bend-over test before taking my first step into the water.</p>

<p><strong>Use waders wisely</strong>. Waders are a photographer’s best friend for water shots. I prefer chest-high waders, but some of my colleagues prefer thigh highs.  I never put on my waders until I am literally ready to step into the water. That precaution minimizes the chances of tears. I prefer a felt sole bottom so I can feel the rocks I’m stepping on, but other people prefer rubber boot bottoms. My modus operandi in winter is this: I get to the stream’s edge and get all my equipment set up on my tripod. Then I spread out a small piece of nylon tarp material. I stand on it and remove my hiking boots, keeping them dry. With my thick wool socks on, I slip into my waders. Then I reverse the procedure when I return, giving me dry feet for the rest of the day. My waders roll up into a bag that attaches to the bottom of my backpack. Also, be sure to cinch the waist belt on your chest waders before going into the water. If you accidentally trip and ship water, your waders won’t fill.</p>

<p><strong>Use chest pockets</strong>. I move all my accessories- filters, tele-extender, microfiber cloth for occasional splashes, etc- out of my pants pockets and into chest pockets. I also have a waterproof canoe bag that I attach to my vest shoulder snaps.</p>

<p><strong>Slow motion</strong>. Never move quickly while in water. Think first. Move slowly and deliberately. Think about your equipment placement.</p>

<p><strong>Avoid raging water</strong>. Swollen spring streams are no time to wade in. Flash floods can occur in seconds. Swift water plays havoc on balance and will cause camera shake even when your camera is tripod mounted.</p>

<p><strong>Beware muddy bottoms</strong>. The most difficult shooting I experience is while stuck in muddy bottoms. Mud tends to suck onto your boots, literally immobilizing you. I have had to remove my boots or waders, get my camera back to shore and return to pull out my waders. I quickly became hypothermic. Fortunately my car was close by.</p>

<p><strong>Soak in the moment</strong>. Above all else, take time to revel in the Zen of what you are doing.</p>

<p>While I’m in water I feel most immersed in my work, and I’m not being facetious. I love what I do, but when I’m in water capturing a scene I feel connected to the natural order in a very special way. I never take that blessing for granted.</p>
