  <div class="entry-content"><p>Once photographers find out that I travel to the Yukon and Arctic Circle, I’m invariably asked about photographing the Northern Lights, technically known as the Aurora borealis.</p>

<p>There are tons of articles and technical publications related to photographing these miraculous lights that magically appear in the far north at certain times of the year. They are caused by solar winds brushing by the earth’s magnetosphere. The most common color for the lights is green, but under certain conditions the lights can be orange, teal, purple or a combination of these.</p>

<p>Rather than get into a technical discourse, here is some basic information and some personal tips if you are thinking of capturing the Northern (or Southern) lights with your camera. Please note that most of this information is based on personal experience and discussions with my friend Richard Hartmier (<a href="http://www.hartmier.com/flash/light/light.html">http://www.hartmier.com/flash/light/light.html</a> ), an experienced Northern lights photographer who lives in Whitehorse, Yukon. I’m sure I left some things out, so feel free to suggest your own tips so our readers may benefit from your experience.</p>

</div>


<h2 style="text-align: center;">Preparation</h2>


<h3>Time of Year</h3>


<p>Richard points out that in the North it doesn’t get dark enough for Northern Lights until mid-August. “Fall is a great time for Northern Lights because you can take advantage of reflections in lakes and rivers. I love September for the Lights.”</p>

<p>Winter also works, with the best times being late February, March and April.</p>

<h3>Consult Websites</h3>


<p>“Before you go, consult a number of websites,” Richard advises. “Then make your go-no go decision.” If you are in the Yukon or Alaska, sites such as <a href="http://www.spaceweather.com">www.spaceweather.com</a>,  the University of Alaska, Canadian government sites and the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration (NOAA) each have sites that predict the aurora (just Google “aurora predictions”). However, keep in mind that aurora prediction is an inexact science and it’s common for sites to be way wrong.</p>

<h3>Dress Warmly</h3>


<p>The first step to getting successful lights images is to dress warmly. “Layers is the answer,” says Richard. However cold you anticipate it being, add yet another layer to accommodate the fact that you will essentially be standing still on snow for hours at a time. Use chemical hand warmers for your mittens and boots, as needed. They are available at outdoor stores, as well as big box stores like Costco or BJs. One pair for your gloves or boots will last a good 8 hours. Wear a warm hat, under your parka hood. Use two hand protectors; a thin glove so you can operate your camera controls and a warm pair of mittens over them.</p>

<h3>Use a Tripod</h3>


<p>“A good tripod is mandatory,” says Richard, and I agree. Since you’ll be using very long shutter opening times- up to 30 seconds- the only effective way to get good, sharp Aurora images is by using a tripod.</p>

<h3>… And a Cable Release</h3>


<p>Coupled with your tripod, use a cable release to minimize vibration and shake.</p>

<h3>… And a Headlamp</h3>


<p>You’ll need both hands free to change camera settings and orientation, level, batteries, etc.</p>

<h3>Bring Extra Batteries</h3>


<p>Charge your batteries before you go. Cold weather, especially the extreme cold you’ll encounter in the high north, saps battery power at an incredible rate. Bring extra charged batteries for your camera, headlamp, cable/electronic shutter release and any other battery-powered devices.</p>

<h3>Take Food</h3>


<p>Your body uses lots of calories to keep itself within a narrow temperature range. Take along high fat/high energy foods like nuts and raisins, along with a thermos of hot chocolate to keep yourself nourished.</p>

<h3>Site selection</h3>


<p>“Select a site with good foregrounds if that’s important to your composition,” Richard offers. “That might be a snow covered tree or water.” Richard prefers wide open spaces that give a 360 degree view of the sky, with mountains in the background. “It’s also nice to have moonlight in the image,” he advises, based on his extensive experience.</p>

<p>“Remember that you can always light foreground objects with your headlamp or a flashlight or even your flash,” an increasingly common effect seen on websites nowadays. “But, don’t push that too far,” cautions Richard. “You’re close to God here and I don’t go for too much artificial stuff.”</p>

<h2 style="text-align: center;">Camera Issues</h2>


<h3><strong>Using a Point-and-Shoot (PAS)</strong></h3>


<p>“Most PAS cameras are not up to shooting Northern Lights,” according to Richard. “If you are serious about Northern Lights, make the investment in a DSLR.” I agree, although you can get passable (but not professional level) images with a PAS. Some of the newer PASs, like the Cannon G12, do offer needed options which will allow you to get terrific aurora shots (see below). However, no matter what type of camera you use you really need to use a tripod for good results.</p>

<h3>Change to Manual Focus</h3>


<p>If you are using a PAS (or a DSLR), read your manual and learn how to put it into manual focus mode and then set focus to infinity. Note that some autofocus lenses under- or over-focus at infinity, so it’s a good idea to set up your camera while it is still light and focus it manually on a distant point and be sure to get critical focus. Then, make a mental note of where the pointer on the lens barrel points in relation to the infinity symbol (you may even want to use a permanent marker to mark the spot). Pre-set your camera to that focus setting, leave it on manual focus before you leave and be sure to wear a head lamp. The fewer things you have to fiddle with in the dark, the better your experience- and results- will be.</p>

<h3>Shoot Wide Open</h3>


<p>“The main thing is you need a wide angle lens with a fast aperture,” Richard suggests. The “faster” your lens, the better the results will be, because ypu’ll be able to use shorter exposure times and capture the lights more crisply.</p>

<p>Use a wide angle lens (no more than 28 mm, but preferably 20mm&#8230; or even less) with a rated f stop of 2.8 or less. A rating of 2.0 or 1.4 is even better, but such lenses are expensive. Check the used market for good deals on manual focus lenses. I checked eBay (February, 2011) and found several Nikon 24mm f2.0 lenses for under $500.</p>

<p>Richard is adamant on this issue if you want to achieve professional results. &#8220;My recommendation is that  top notch manual focus lenses like the new Zeiss offerings or some of the older manual focus lens that are still available on the used market are a lot easier to achieve and maintain infinity focus in the field.&#8221;</p>

<p><strong>Set Your ISO</strong></p>

<p>Try to use as low an ISO setting as possible. As you increase your ISO, noise increases and will affect your image. Noise in digital cameras is what grain was in film days. On the other hand, if by lowering your ISO you will increase your exposure time to more than 30 seconds, then bump up your ISO a bit. Lights photography is a bit of a balancing act.</p>

<h3>Turn on Noise Reduction</h3>


<p>Many cameras have a setting that minimizes noise. However, that usually doubles the amount of time it takes to record the image. So, for example, if you leave the shutter open for 20 seconds, it will take an additional 20 seconds for the in-camera computer to reduce the noise. Aurora photography involves a lot of patience and trial-and-error.</p>

<h3>Don’t Use Filters</h3>


<p>Whatever you do, be sure to remove all filters from in front of your lens. Filters can cause interference patterns that will ruin the images (in the sample, below, note the bulls-eye rings in the aurora, just above the  river).</p>

<p><a href="http://blog.lesterpickerphoto.com/wp-content/uploads/2011/02/2008-Yukon-Dawson-City-332008-09-191.jpg"><img class="size-medium wp-image-975" title="Northen lights over Yukon River, Dawson City, Yukon, Canada" src="http://blog.lesterpickerphoto.com/wp-content/uploads/2011/02/2008-Yukon-Dawson-City-332008-09-191-300x199.jpg" alt="" width="300" height="199"></a></p>

<h3>Start at 20 Seconds</h3>


<p>With your camera on manual focus and set on infinity, trip your shutter and time it to stay open for 20 seconds as a starting point. In some cameras, you will need to set your camera to “Bulb” to accomplish this. Other cameras have pre-set long time intervals to make the job easier.</p>

<p>Once the camera is done processing the image, use your screen to assess results. Against the black of night it’s easier to do this than during daylight. If you can magnify the image in camera, do so and examine the shadowed areas and aurora areas for noise.</p>

<p>If the aurora is too faint, increase the exposure time by 5 seconds and try again. However, try not to go above 30 seconds because you will then get smears in the image instead of distinct starlight points. Those smears are actually star tracks formed by the earth’s rotation. “The shorter the exposure, the better,” advises Richard, “because you’ll get better details in the lights, better streaks and better curtains. Boost your ISO to the highest possible without introducing noise.”</p>

<h3>Stay On It</h3>


<p>Just because 25 seconds works at first, doesn’t mean it will work later in the display. Auroras are highly variable. Sometimes they will be faint and ten minutes later they pulse with energy. So, always maintain your vigil and adjust exposures to suit.</p>

<h2 style="text-align: center;">After the Shoot</h2>


<h3>Guard Against Condensation</h3>


<p>Your cameras will cold through and through when your shoot is done. Before you come back inside, whether to a warm car or hotel or house, place your cameras and lenses in a sealed plastic bag so condensation forms on the outside of the bag and not on and in your cameras. Condensation inside your camera can ruin the electronic and mechanical components (see my previous blog on condensation: <a href="http://blog.lesterpickerphoto.com/2011/01/06/condensation-recommendation/">http://blog.lesterpickerphoto.com/2011/01/06/condensation-recommendation/</a>).</p>

<h3>Post-Processing</h3>


<p>“Lots of people use a contrast mask in PhotoShop or use another method to boost contrast,” Richard points out. “You may also want to fiddle with White Balance until the image looks like it looked to you in the sky.”</p>

<p>Good luck with your aurora experiments. Remember, a warm photographer is a happy one.</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>As Robert Burns so ably said: “The best laid plans o’ mice of men, gang aft agley.” Or, as my dear mother used to say: ”Man plans and God laughs.”</p>

<p>So, my trip up the Dempster Highway to the Arctic Circle to photograph the Porcupine caribou herd is now up in smoke. More accurately it is down in snowflakes, as in a blizzard with 90 km/hour winds and whiteout conditions that was expected to last for days. Two winter storms converged right over the Arctic Circle in Yukon territory, making the only road in and out impassable.</p>

<p>I’m bummed; 3,500 miles and nothing to show for it in terms of wildlife photography. But I did finally get to see the Yukon Quest dogsled race, which was phenomenal (see previous post:<a href="http://blog.lesterpickerphoto.com/2011/02/09/the-yukon-quest-begins/">http://blog.lesterpickerphoto.com/2011/02/09/the-yukon-quest-begins/</a>), so the trip was not a total loss. And I love Yukoners and the very unique characters that they are, so many a night was spent over some good beer and even better company.</p>

<p><a href="http://blog.lesterpickerphoto.com/wp-content/uploads/2011/02/2008-Yukon-Dawson-City-332008-09-19.jpg"><img class="size-medium wp-image-968" title="Northen lights over Yukon River, Dawson City, Yukon, Canada" src="http://blog.lesterpickerphoto.com/wp-content/uploads/2011/02/2008-Yukon-Dawson-City-332008-09-19-300x199.jpg" alt="" width="300" height="199"></a></p>

<p>Before I left I did make tentative plans to go back next March, both to capture images of caribou and to improve my chances of Northern Lights images. But for now, sad to say, it’s the end of my Yukon winter adventure, although I’m slated to return late this summer (for Yukon Fall images) with a group of friends. Yukon in summer is a different animal entirely, but one I enjoy every bit as much. Stay tuned.</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>If you’re headed for a Yukon adventure, you’ll almost definitely stay in Whitehorse at some point in your travels. With a population of 25,000, Whitehorse is by far the largest city in the Yukon. In fact, if you subtract Whitehorse’s population, there are only about 8,000 additional Yukon residents occupying a territory nearly 20% larger than California (and that state has around 35 million people)!</p>

<p>Whitehorse, capital city of the Yukon, is really a lovely small city, the kind you can easily wrap your brain around. One of the things I love most about it is that, unlike so many American cities, there is actually a walkable downtown where residents do much of their shopping. There are clothing stores, restaurants, two real, live bookstores, small hotels and lots of coffee shops. There are huge, colorful murals covering many of the downtown buildings, celebrating aspects of life Up North. So, for those of you contemplating a trip “Up North,” here is my modest guide to Whitehorse.</p>

<p><a href="http://blog.lesterpickerphoto.com/wp-content/uploads/2011/02/Yukon-Quest2011-around-downtown-Whitehorse-9.jpg"><img class="size-medium wp-image-953" title="Yukon Quest2011-around downtown Whitehorse 9" src="http://blog.lesterpickerphoto.com/wp-content/uploads/2011/02/Yukon-Quest2011-around-downtown-Whitehorse-9-300x200.jpg" alt="" width="300" height="200"></a></p>

<p>I’ll periodically update this section each time I visit and discover new treats, so check again before you take off for the North. Also, make sure to visit my blogs on Dawson City (<a href="http://blog.lesterpickerphoto.com/2011/02/10/dawson-city-or-bust/">http://blog.lesterpickerphoto.com/2011/02/10/dawson-city-or-bust/</a>).</p>

<h3>Coffee Rules!</h3>


<p>In a land where winter occupies most of the pages in the calendar, coffee is the drug of choice. Whitehorse sports a dozen (maybe more) coffee shops, so you’re sure to find at least one that will appeal to you. Here is a sampling.</p>

<p>If you’ve never tried one before, you’ve got to make at least one stop at <strong><em>Tim Horton’s </em></strong>(there are two of them on Second Avenue), which is the Canadian equivalent of Dunkin’ Donuts. Personally, I’m not a Horton’s fan, but think of it as part of your Canada acculturation process.</p>

<p>Next up is the omnipresent <strong><em>Starbucks</em></strong>, and Whitehorse hosts two of them. One is situated on Main Street (201 Main Street), at a major downtown intersection and is hard to miss.</p>

<p>My favorite downtown coffee shop is <strong><em>Baked Cafe</em></strong> (100-108 Main Street), although it has now been “found” and is often crowded. However, the coffee is great and the pastries divine. Baked also offers a wide range of healthy, delicious sandwiches for breakfast or lunch. Try one of their egg panini sandwiches for breakfast. Hot off the grill it’s hard to beat on a cold morning.</p>

<p><a href="http://blog.lesterpickerphoto.com/wp-content/uploads/2011/02/Yukon-Quest2011-around-downtown-Whitehorse-22.jpg"><img class="size-medium wp-image-949" title="Yukon Quest2011-around downtown Whitehorse 22" src="http://blog.lesterpickerphoto.com/wp-content/uploads/2011/02/Yukon-Quest2011-around-downtown-Whitehorse-22-300x200.jpg" alt="" width="300" height="200"></a></p>

<p>If you’re headed for a day of cross-country skiing, snowshoeing, snowmobiling or just sightseeing, be sure to stop at <strong><em>Bean North Coffee Roasting Company</em></strong>. Located on the Takhini Hot Springs Road, you could couple a hearty cup of java with a dip in the hot springs. Bean North is housed in an old house and you’ll sit in comfortable chairs and couches while you sip your favorite beverage. All coffee is roasted on site and they also provide the coffee for Baked Cafe.</p>

<p><a href="http://blog.lesterpickerphoto.com/wp-content/uploads/2011/02/Yukon-Quest2011-Bean-Noth-Coffee-Roasters-Takhini-8-1.jpg"><img class="size-medium wp-image-959" title="Yukon Quest2011-Bean Noth Coffee Roasters-Takhini  8 (1)" src="http://blog.lesterpickerphoto.com/wp-content/uploads/2011/02/Yukon-Quest2011-Bean-Noth-Coffee-Roasters-Takhini-8-1-200x300.jpg" alt="" width="200" height="300"></a></p>

<h3>Restaurants</h3>


<p>There is no shortage of restaurants in Whitehorse. From meat and potatoes to fresh caught salmon, you’ll be able to find it here. One thing to note. The Yukon is known for its water-to-table salmon and char. Here you’ll also find fresh meats, including bison and elk. Another note: Yukon is very informal. You never really need to dress up, even at the most upscale establishments. Here are some of my favorite restaurants.</p>

<p>You’d hardly expect a Caribbean-themed restaurant in the Yukon, but <strong><em>Antoinette’s</em></strong> (Fourth Avenue off Wood Street) is a classy, avant garde establishment with atmosphere and attitude. Run by Antoinette Oliphant, the restaurant of her name has an eclectic, but surprisingly delectable menu. Antoinette herself is a joy and she freely mingles with customers, making them feel at home.</p>

<p>Right next door to Antoinette’s is <em><strong>Ruby’s</strong></em>, a funky restaurant catering to vegans. Ruby’s is owned and run by Antoinette’s parents who recently moved to the Yukon and are experienced restaurateurs in their own right.</p>

<p><strong><em>Klondike Rib and Salmon</em></strong> (Second Avenue off Steele Street) is an enormously popular restaurant, and for good reason. They serve fresh food, good bread and trimmings. However, they are not open in winter, as you can see from the following sign in their window.</p>

<p><a href="http://blog.lesterpickerphoto.com/wp-content/uploads/2011/02/Yukon-Quest2011-around-downtown-Whitehorse-44.jpg"><img class="size-medium wp-image-950" title="Yukon Quest2011-around downtown Whitehorse 44" src="http://blog.lesterpickerphoto.com/wp-content/uploads/2011/02/Yukon-Quest2011-around-downtown-Whitehorse-44-300x200.jpg" alt="" width="300" height="200"></a></p>

<p>The restaurant is designed as a cabin tent. When the place is hopping, it can be crowded and noisy, but the food is superb. Try their ribs or muskox dishes, which my companions tell me is delicious (I wouldn’t know, since I don’t eat meat). Their fish and chips (which I do eat) was delicious, washed down with an ice-cold Yukon Gold beer.</p>

<p>For a change of pace, I love <strong><em>Sakura Sushi</em></strong> (404 Wood Street off Fourth Avenue), a Japanese establishment with a wide variety of dishes. Their sushi is to die for, especially those that incorporate salmon and char. They also have refreshingly different fruit sushi. I particularly enjoy their BC Box, an assortment of sushi, tempura, soy and ginger grilled salmon, cabbage and rice.</p>

<p>A close second in terms of Japanese fare is <strong><em>Tokyo Sushi</em></strong> (204 Main Street). Their lunch specials are a good deal and a great pick-me-up on frigid days. .</p>

<p>The <strong><em>Cellar Steakhouse and Wine Bar</em></strong>, located in the basement of the Edgewater Hotel (First Avenue and Main Street) is a renovated space devoted to upscale dining, with an expanded wine selection. When I recently dined there, all appetizers were excellent. My companions all raved about their meat dishes. I ordered a salmon dish and found it dry, reflecting the newness of the kitchen staff. However, I believe the restaurant has good potential, as it irons out the kinks.</p>

<p>The <strong><em>Burnt Toast Cafe</em></strong> is another option for breakfast or lunch, offering traditional, as well as unexpected fare. Nice wait staff always helpful with recommendations and good food, too.</p>

<p><strong>Earls Restaurant</strong> (9016 Quartz Road) is a chain eatery with generally good food and a friendly waitstaff. Their food is what I call &#8220;solid,&#8221; meaning tasty and fresh, but not inspiring. Their lunch menu is especially good. I enjoy their soups, with a side of Rosemary-Oregano Bread. Be warned that the bread portion is enough to feed two or three people with normal appetites.</p>

<p>I wouldn’t exactly call the <strong><em>Urban Cake Shop</em></strong> a restaurant, but it is a damned good place for traditional as well as zany cupcakes.</p>

<p>Okay, I kinda saved the best for last. If you’re going from Whitehorse to Dawson City, plan to stop about 75 minutes out of town for breakfast. Now, here’s the point; skip breakfast! Instead get one of <strong><em>Braeburn Lodge</em></strong>’s Cinnamon Buns. Just one. It’s guaranteed to feed at least 4 people and you’ll still have some left over for an after lunch treat. It truly is THAT good! Proprietor (and baker) Steve Watson is the big, burly guy with the white beard. Enjoy a cup of hot coffee with him. Thanks to Sibell and Stephen for the introductions.</p>

<h3>Hotels</h3>


<p>Whitehorse offers a range of lodging, from hostels and low-budget motels to comfortable (but not luxury) hotels. I’ve only had experience with  four hotels, and two I feel comfortable recommending.</p>

<p>I generally stay in the <strong><em>Westmark Hotel</em></strong> (Wood Street and Second Avenue), which is owned by Holland America cruise line. Yukon is offered as a trip extension for Holland America Alaska cruises, hence the connection. I’d describe the hotel as 3-star, but the staff is unbeatable, willing to go out of their way with friendly, fast service. The restaurant draws locals, which says a lot about its unpretentious ambience.</p>

<p>If you are using Whitehorse as a quick stop en route to Dawson City or points north, you really can’t do better than the <strong><em>Skyy Hotel</em></strong>, right across from the airport. Aside from clean rooms, the in-house restaurant is excellent and a destination eatery for Whitehorse residents.</p>

<h3>Events</h3>


<p>For the penultimate Yukon experience, there is nothing that can beat the<strong><em> Yukon Quest</em></strong>, the annual 1,000 mile long dogsled race that goes from Whitehorse, Yukon to Fairbanks, Alaska. The Quest is widely considered the most grueling, eclipsing the Iditarod.</p>

<p>The Quest alternates its starting gate, with odd years launching from Whitehorse and even years from Fairbanks so you’ll need to make plans accordingly. When the race leaves from Whitehorse, the tourism folks do a bang-up job of making it a fun family event, with celebrations lasting a week. There are hot air balloons, a banquet, dogsled rides, and lots more.</p>

<p>Whitehorse sponsors festivals throughout the year, including the Frostbite Music Festival, the Available Light Film Festival, Kayak and triathlete marathons, summer and fall events. Go to <a href="http://www.trafelyukon.com">www.travelyukon.com</a> for details.</p>

<h3>Activities</h3>


<p>You name the summer or winter sport and it’s available in and around Whitehorse. There are just too many vendors to mention here, but suffice it to say that the best tend to stay in business.</p>

<p>For dogsledding adventures for a day to a week or more, I recommend<strong><em> Sky High Wilderness Adventures</em></strong> (<a href="http://www.skyhighwilderness.com">www.skyhighwilderness.com</a>) and <strong><em>MukTuk Adventures</em></strong> (<a href="http://www.muktuk.com">www.muktuk.com</a>), run by the inveterate Frank Turner, the record holder for longevity in the Quest race, with 24 completed races under his belt.</p>

<p>Whitehorse also has top-ranked adventure guides and facilities offering canoeing along the Klondike and Yukon Rivers, as well as kayaking, motor boating, fishing and more.</p>

<p>Flightseeing is available year round. One solid company is <strong><em>Sifton Air</em></strong> in Haines Junction (<a href="http:/www.yukonairtours.com">www.yukonairtours.com</a>), about 90 minutes from Whitehorse. They run glacier tours into Kluane National Park surely one of the most spectacular places on Earth. I especially recommend the winter tours and suggest taking a morning or late afternoon flight when the sun is low in the sky and the mountains are warmed by the sun’s rays. On my recent flight, we spotted 12 moose, 2 wolves, and two coyotes. We even tracked a grizzly that had briefly awakened from its winter sleep but were unable to locate the animal itself.</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>Dawson City, Yukon, is like an itch under your skin. No matter how much you scratch, it’s always there. That’s how Dawson City is for me. I love this whacky, unpaved, raw hole in the wilderness, where the people are real and the frontier mentality is alive and well. When I’m gone for any appreciable time, I think of it and its zany character.</p>

<p><a href="http://blog.lesterpickerphoto.com/wp-content/uploads/2011/02/Yukon-Quest2011-Dawson-City-28.jpg"><img class="aligncenter size-medium wp-image-942" title="Yukon Quest2011-Dawson City 28" src="http://blog.lesterpickerphoto.com/wp-content/uploads/2011/02/Yukon-Quest2011-Dawson-City-28-300x200.jpg" alt="The Downtown Hotel" width="300" height="200"></a></p>

<p>Dawson City was built nearly overnight, at the height of the Klondike Gold Rush. During its heyday in 1898, Dawson had more than 40,000 people, every one them somehow involved in the madness of the gold rush. Today the town has perhaps 1,200 residents, although that number climbs somewhat in summer.</p>

<p>Today, Dawson is the epicenter of wilderness travel, the launch point for canoeing, kayaking, hiking and touring adventures. It is the provisioning place for those traveling to the western Arctic Circle and beyond. I’m here today for two reasons. First is to cover the Yukon Quest dogsled race, an epic 1,000 mile battle between man and dog and nature. Dawson City is a major stop in that race, a mandatory 36-hour layover for mushers and their dogs. Once all the mushers leave Dawson for their final dash to Fairbanks, Alaska, I’m off with fellow photographer Richard Hartmier to the Arctic Circle, where we hope to rendezvous with the Porcupine Caribou herd for a photo shoot.</p>

<p>Back to Dawson. Surrounding the city are the scarred remains of the gold rush, when massive mining machines entered the fray and tore through the earth, heaving tons of soil and rock aside in man’s unquenchable thirst for the gold metal. But the tiny town of Dawson itself is a jewel. First, there are fantastic places to eat, from simple breakfasts to fine dinners (specifics in a later blog). The streets are laid out in a neat grid, with museums and historic building left or restored to their former glory. There is even a wonderful Opera House that serves to this day as an entertainment venue.</p>

<p><a href="http://blog.lesterpickerphoto.com/wp-content/uploads/2011/02/Yukon-Quest2011-Dawson-City-13.jpg"><img class="size-medium wp-image-943 " title="Yukon Quest2011-Dawson City 13" src="http://blog.lesterpickerphoto.com/wp-content/uploads/2011/02/Yukon-Quest2011-Dawson-City-13-300x200.jpg" alt="" width="300" height="200"></a></p>

<p>Dawson was also the first town in Canada to have a gambling hall, and Diamond Tooth Gertie’s Gambling Hall is still operating. Aside from the gambling there is a marvelously entertaining, turn-of-the-century vaudeville show.</p>

<p>Of course, Dawson is a true frontier town and, as such, has its quirky side, most notably the Sourtoe Cocktail. Served at the historic Downtown Hotel, the drink requires one to… well… okay, there’s no way to sugar-coat this; it requires one to drink a shot of whiskey (or scotch or whatever your poison happens to be) in which a human toe is suspended. The rule is the toe must at least touch your lips, amidst much cheering and profane comments from your fellow inebriated friends. Now, to be sure the toe is biologically clean, stewing as it has been for many, many years in alcohol. But its shriveled, blackened appearance will test the mettle of the stoutest, grizzled Yukoner (let alone photographer originally from Brooklyn, NY). Proudly, I do sport certificate number 31179 (September 20th, 2008), for those you wanting to look up my membership in the rather exclusive Sourtoe Cocktail Club.</p>

<p>Robert Service, the great Canadian poet whose Cremation of Sam McGee is a staple in schools throughout North America, lived here in Dawson and his cabin is still preserved, along with Jack London&#8217;s cabin, all worthy of tours. You&#8217;ll see odes to these great literary figures throughout town.</p>

<h2 style="text-align: center;">Dawson City Details</h2>


<h3>Places of Interest</h3>


<p><strong>Dawson City Museum</strong> (595 Fifth Avenue: <a href="http://www.dawsonmuseum.ca">www.dawsonmuseum.ca</a>) is a wonderful educational venue for the family. As soon as you enter the museum you are presented with interactive displays explaining the geology of the region. Displays also cover the indigenous aboriginal cultures, as well as exploration by whites, the Klondike Gold Rush and development of Dawson City. There is also a nice gift shop with items on natural history, aboriginal culture, photography books, jewelry and more.</p>

<p><strong>Danoja Zho (Long Ago House) Cultural Centre</strong>: (<a href="http://trondekheritage.com/danoja-zho/">http://trondekheritage.com/danoja-zho/</a>) is a small, but critically important museum to understanding the First Nations culture in the region. The Tr’ondëk Hwëch’in culture was dominant in the area until the arrival of white culture and the Centre has displays that show how the native culture interacted with its environment. The Centre also has a wonderful gift shop, offering hand-crafted aboriginal items, clothing, jewelry, music and more.</p>

<p><strong>Moosehide Village</strong> (<a href="http://trondekheritage.com/our-places/trochek/">http://trondekheritage.com/our-places/trochek/</a>) is a vigorous hike from Dawson City along the banks of the Yukon River. It is a working aboriginal village and if you hike there, please respect the people and their homes. You must have permission to go there and it can be obtained at the reception desk at the Tr’ondëk Hwëch’in Government building.</p>

<p><strong>Klondike Institute of Art and Culture</strong> (2nd Avenue and Princess Street) offers exhibits of paintings and photographs and also coordinates art shows in Dawson City.</p>

<p>In addition to the above sites, there are numerous historic building located throughout Dawson City. The Park Service maintains a visitor’s information site on  Front and King Streets. They also offer walking tours of the city from May to September, using very knowledgeable guides dressed in period costumes.</p>

<p><strong>Dredge # 4</strong> on Bonanza Creek, just outside the city, is a national treasure. It is the largest wood hull dredge ever built and the mammoth gold-dredging behemoth is open for guided tours during the tourist season. It’s a fascinating tour and one I recommend for insights into Yukon’s mining history.</p>

<p><strong> Jack London Interpretive Museum</strong> (8th Avenue and Firth Street: ) offers guided tours explaining the life and times of the famed Yukon writer.</p>

<p><strong> Robert Service Cabin</strong> (8th Avenue, near the Jack London Museum: <a href="http://www.pc.gc.ca/lhn-nhs/yt/klondike/natcul/natcul-dawson/natcul5.aspx">http://www.pc.gc.ca/lhn-nhs/yt/klondike/natcul/natcul-dawson/natcul5.aspx</a>).</p>

<p><strong>The Dome </strong>(formally known as The Midnight Dome) is located just outside the city, about a 5-minute drive from downtown. The road winds up the dome and ends at the summit with a view that encompasses all Dawson and a picturesque part of the Yukon River. Great place for a family picnic and photos of the area.</p>

<h2>Hotels</h2>


<p>There are several hotels in Dawson, catering to hostelers and the general market. There are no luxury, 5-star accommodations (or even 4-star). I can personally recommend two of them, having stayed for extended times in both.</p>

<p><strong>Downtown Hotel</strong> (2nd Avenue and Queen Street: <a href="http://www.downtownhotel.ca">www.downtownhotel.ca</a>), home of the infamous Sourtoe Cocktail, is the accommodation most visitors consider the “must-stay” place. It’s historic structure and old-timey ambience will put you into the right frame of mind for turn-of-the-century Dawson City. However, the hotel is old and a bit on the ragged side. There is no elevator, so you’ll have to drag your bags up and down stairs. There is a nice restaurant, the Jack London Grill, in the hotel, particularly for breakfast. Adjoining the hotel is it’s bar, which serves the Sourtoe Cocktail in the evening (see prior blog: <a href="http://blog.lesterpickerphoto.com/2011/02/10/dawson-city-or-bust/">http://blog.lesterpickerphoto.com/2011/02/10/dawson-city-or-bust/</a>).</p>

<p><strong>The Eldorado Hotel</strong> (3rd Avenue and Princess Street: <a href="http://blog.lesterpickerphoto.com/2011/02/10/dawson-city-or-bust/">http://blog.lesterpickerphoto.com/2011/02/10/dawson-city-or-bust/</a>) has more modern accommodations than the Downtown Hotel. Once again, a lack of elevators means you’ll have to either lug your bags up or request help from the front desk. An attached restaurant/bar is perfect for casual food. Their nacho platter is huge, dripping with cheese and, paired with a beer, perfect for watching a hockey game.</p>

<h2>Restaurants</h2>


<p><strong>Klondike Kate’s</strong> (3rd Avenue and King Street: <a href="http://www.klondikekates.ca">http://www.klondikekates.ca</a>) has a good reputation for hearty Yukon foods and their popular Tin Roof pie. It can be crowded at peak times.</p>

<p><strong>Jack London Grill</strong>, located in the Downtown Hotel, serves basic fare. Good for breakfast and lunch, but I’d recommend elsewhere for dinner.</p>

<p><strong>Riverwest Bistro</strong> (Front and Queen Streets) serves up great coffee, hearty breakfasts and healthy lunch sandwiches. It’s my favorite breakfast and lunch spot in Dawson City during the tourist season. Not open in winter.</p>

<p><strong>The Drunken Goat </strong>(2nd Avenue and York Street) specializes in mediterranean foods, especially Greek. The portion sizes are generous and the food superb. It’s probably the best dining experience in Dawson.</p>

<p><strong>Sourdough Joe’s</strong> (Front Street, near Riverwest Bistro) serves incredibly good halibut or salmon fish and chips. If you’re into poutine, a French Canadian dish of french fries with melted cheddar, this is THE place in Dawson to get it. Only open during tourist season.</p>

<p>And, remember, dining in the Yukon, especially Dawson City, is very informal.</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>To call the Yukon Quest merely a dogsled race is akin to calling the Superbowl just another football game. The Quest is the penultimate showdown, a grueling match of dogs and man (or woman) against whatever nature can conjure up on its worst day. It is a 1,000 mile long endurance test of man and beast.</p>

<p>Make no mistake about it; every musher and every dog is a finely tuned athlete, melded into a team that, if all goes well, functions seamlessly. These are working dogs in every sense of the word. They live to run and the love and devotion between musher and dog is evident before each racer takes off. Hugs, words of encouragement, last minute snacks for the dogs are proof of that caring.</p>

<p><a href="http://blog.lesterpickerphoto.com/wp-content/uploads/2011/02/Yukon-Quest2011-Mushing-Sky-High-Wilderness-Adventures-6.jpg"><img class="size-medium wp-image-934" title="Yukon Quest2011-Mushing-Sky High Wilderness Adventures 6" src="http://blog.lesterpickerphoto.com/wp-content/uploads/2011/02/Yukon-Quest2011-Mushing-Sky-High-Wilderness-Adventures-6-200x300.jpg" alt="" width="200" height="300"></a></p>

<p>The city of Whitehorse, Yukon takes on the air of a carnival during Quest on alternate years. Since the race takes mushers from Whitehorse to Fairbanks, Alaska, the starting venue alternates between the two cities. There is the kickoff banquet, a lively affair which anyone can attend. In Yukon, leave your formal wear at home. Typical dress at the banquet consisted of mukluk boots, wool sweaters and beaver fur hats.</p>

<p>Ten veterinarians examine every dog before the start and at every mandatory checkpoint. Led by Dr. Alan Hallman from Arizona, the Quest’s high standards are evident in the healthy looking dogs. There are mandatory stops long the route to allow both mushers and their dogs to rest. Each musher starts the race with 14 dogs. Few ever finish with all their dogs. Any dogs who become ill or injured are left with the team’s handlers at a checkpoint and immediately treated by the vets. This sport draws such passionate participants, every one of the 12 vets is a volunteer.</p>

<p>The winning musher will average about 100 miles per day. You simply cannot appreciate that feat until you arrive in the Yukon. The teams will encounter -40F temps regularly throughout the race. They will have to climb mountains that would challenge the most able mountaineer. Even worse, they will have to traverse steep mountain downhills that brings every skill to bear as they try to prevent the sleds from careening out of control.</p>

<p>Before the race begins, the expressions on the faces of the mushers changes radically from the celebratory mood of the banquet the night before to a high seriousness of purpose as each one loads his sled, feeds his dogs and finally, just minutes before the race starts, harnesses his dogs to the sled. Five of the 25 mushers are women.</p>

<p>At the start of the race I’m in the chute, positioned with probably 25 other photographers from around the world. I rarely do event photography - my specialty is landscape and wildlife- and in the excitement of the race I am so busy watching the goings on I sometimes forget to keep shooting.</p>

<p>Each musher leads a team into the chute and gives final hugs to his or her 14 team members. The noise of the dogs barking and howling, wanting desperately to start pulling, is overpowering. The mushers check the dogs’ booties, designed to protect the animals from ice cuts. They pull at the rigging to make sure they are secure. They whisper words of encouragement to their charges.</p>

<p><a href="http://blog.lesterpickerphoto.com/wp-content/uploads/2011/02/Yukon-Quest2011-Mushing-Sky-High-Wilderness-Adventures-5.jpg"><img class="aligncenter size-medium wp-image-935" title="Yukon Quest2011-Mushing-Sky High Wilderness Adventures 5" src="http://blog.lesterpickerphoto.com/wp-content/uploads/2011/02/Yukon-Quest2011-Mushing-Sky-High-Wilderness-Adventures-5-199x300.jpg" alt="Eager to start" width="199" height="300"></a></p>

<p>Thousands of spectators line the starting chute cheering each competitor. Every three minutes the race officials send off another team. In a little over an hour the din of the dogs is replaced by an eerie quiet, as the crowds saunter off to the many other events around town.</p>

<p><a href="http://blog.lesterpickerphoto.com/wp-content/uploads/2011/02/Yukon-Quest2011-Mushing-Sky-High-Wilderness-Adventures-2.jpg"><img class="size-medium wp-image-936" title="Yukon Quest2011-Mushing-Sky High Wilderness Adventures 2" src="http://blog.lesterpickerphoto.com/wp-content/uploads/2011/02/Yukon-Quest2011-Mushing-Sky-High-Wilderness-Adventures-2-200x300.jpg" alt="" width="200" height="300"></a></p>

<p>The Yukon Quest is a family event, a true celebration of man and dog pitted against whatever nature throws at them. What makes it all the more wonderful to me is that it takes place in the glorious Yukon.</p>

<p><a href="http://blog.lesterpickerphoto.com/wp-content/uploads/2011/02/Yukon-Quest2011-Mushing-Sky-High-Wilderness-Adventures-7.jpg"><img class="size-medium wp-image-937" title="Yukon Quest2011-Mushing-Sky High Wilderness Adventures 7" src="http://blog.lesterpickerphoto.com/wp-content/uploads/2011/02/Yukon-Quest2011-Mushing-Sky-High-Wilderness-Adventures-7-199x300.jpg" alt="" width="199" height="300"></a></p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>Okay, I&#8217;m hooked. After spending the afternoon at Sky High Wilderness Ranch in Whitehorse, Yukon, there&#8217;s no doubt in my mind I&#8217;ll be back, this time for a sled dog wilderness camping adventure. Few times have I had more fun as a travel photographer than I did today.</p>

<p><a href="http://blog.lesterpickerphoto.com/wp-content/uploads/2011/02/Yukon-Quest2011-Mushing-Sky-High-Wilderness-Adventures.jpg"><img class="size-medium wp-image-924 " title="Yukon Quest2011-Mushing-Sky High Wilderness Adventures" src="http://blog.lesterpickerphoto.com/wp-content/uploads/2011/02/Yukon-Quest2011-Mushing-Sky-High-Wilderness-Adventures-300x199.jpg" alt="" width="300" height="199"></a></p>

<p>Mushing is as endemic to the Yukon as ice hockey is to the rest of Canada. There are scads of outfitters, lodges and guides who will happily arrange a dogsledding adventure for individuals and families. Two of the best are Sky High and MukTuk Adventures, run by veteran musher Frank Turner. More on both of them in a later blog.</p>

<p>For now, two things to mention. First, these dogs are incredible. They live to work. Never have I seen animals so eager to run. If you doubt that at all, take a look at this YouTube video I shot for you on my iPod Touch.</p>

<p><a href="http://www.youtube.com/user/lespicker#p/a/u/1/WfmZm5-S7Rw">http://www.youtube.com/user/lespicker#p/a/u/1/WfmZm5-S7Rw</a></p>

<p>Next, the dogs&#8217; care. Despite what some would lead you to believe, these incredible animals are healthy, well cared for, and happy. They are raised with love from birth, although there are undoubtedly the rare instances of abuse, I&#8217;m sure. They are socialized as puppies by the older animals and by time they are adults, they are eager to join a team. They have practiced running free besides a harnessed team and are ready to pull as soon as they are hitched.</p>

<p>I have spent large chunks of time in the Yukon over the past four or five years and I have heard many a tale of a musher coming into a small bit of change and spending it entirely on his or her dogs.</p>

<p>But, enough about the dogs.</p>

<p>Mushing is pure poetry. The hectic harnessing and preparations, the dogs barking and baying to get started, finally gives way to the trail as one eases his foot off the &#8216;brake.&#8217; The dogs leap to life once they feel the tension gone and one enters a state of pure grace.</p>

<p>On a wooded trail it is work, steering through turns and negotiating tree limbs. But out on a wide-open lake, as we did today, the only sound you hear is the steady pull of the dogs and the crunching of the sled underfoot. It is instantly addicting.</p>

<p>Of course, we were all clothed properly, but even so the minus 15F temperatures reminded me to pull up my balaclava, pull down my earflaps and raise the hood of my parka. The Yukon is a very special place, dear to my heart and soul. With only 33,000 people, and 25,000 of them living in Whitehorse, the open space is stunning.</p>

<p>And, so we went, around and across Fish Lake, where at times the wind blew patches of snow off the frozen surface, exposing clear ice, our sleds slipping, sliding and scraping for just a few seconds.  Here you can see a view of the Fish Lake, with my able sled team leading me quietly along the trail.</p>

<p><a href="http://www.youtube.com/user/lespicker#p/a/u/0/0sqFuVabBwA">http://www.youtube.com/user/lespicker#p/a/u/0/0sqFuVabBwA</a></p>

<p>And here is the link to the Google maps, showing our route toward and around around Fish Lake.</p>

<p><a href="http://www.spotadventures.com/trip/view/?trip_id=241355">http://www.spotadventures.com/trip/view/?trip_id=241355</a></p>

<p>BTW, for you trivia aficionados, the Gee Haw in the title refers to the two directional commands they use with their dogs. Gee means turn right, while Haw means turn left.</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>Well, after two or three nights of stargazing, Richard Hartmier and I finally got a tiny glimpse of Aurora borealis activity. I say we only because we were out photographing together. Richard lives in the Yukon and has extensively photographed the Northern Lights. In fact, his Aurora work can be found in his books and in postcards sold in gift shops throughout the Yukon.</p>

<p>We were at Fish Lake, perhaps 15 minutes outside the city of Whitehorse (pop: 24,000). There were clouds in the sky, not aparticularly good thing when photographing the Aurora. Normally you would want a large expanse of clear, black sky, with the stars bright.</p>

<p><a href="http://blog.lesterpickerphoto.com/wp-content/uploads/2011/02/Whitehorse-aurora-borealis.jpg"><img class="size-medium wp-image-914" title="Whitehorse aurora borealis" src="http://blog.lesterpickerphoto.com/wp-content/uploads/2011/02/Whitehorse-aurora-borealis-199x300.jpg" alt="" width="199" height="300"></a></p>

<p>In fact, the lights, as they are known up here, were not very energized that night. It took a long exposure to get this image (look for a future blog with tips on photographing the Aurora).</p>

<p><a href="http://blog.lesterpickerphoto.com/wp-content/uploads/2011/02/Whitehorse-aurora-borealis-1.jpg"><img class="size-medium wp-image-915" title="Whitehorse aurora borealis 1" src="http://blog.lesterpickerphoto.com/wp-content/uploads/2011/02/Whitehorse-aurora-borealis-1-199x300.jpg" alt="" width="199" height="300"></a></p>

<p>In the image above, I was looking in the same general direction, but in this instance the lights from  the city of Whitehorse lit up a band of clouds, flaming them orange.</p>

<p><a href="http://blog.lesterpickerphoto.com/wp-content/uploads/2011/02/Whitehorse-aurora-borealis-3.jpg"><img class="size-medium wp-image-916" title="Whitehorse aurora borealis 3" src="http://blog.lesterpickerphoto.com/wp-content/uploads/2011/02/Whitehorse-aurora-borealis-3-300x199.jpg" alt="" width="300" height="199"></a></p>

<p>In the image above, taken about an hour later, the aurora is diffuse over a massive area of sky. Again, the lights from Whitehorse are reflected by the clouds.</p>

<p>There is something magical, spiritual and very humbling about the Northern Lights. I&#8217;m not sure I can explain it, but I know that I definitely feel quite insignificant in its presence. Remember that these images are of a weak display. But even on that night, these images are only of a small part of the night sky. The actual display may totally envelope you, from one horizon to the opposite one.</p>

<p>Of course, one has to brave the frigid temperatures and whatever elements nature throws at you. Some nights the lights don&#8217;t appear at all, on other nights it is too cloudy. But when it does come together, it is awe-inspiring.</p>

<p>I do hope to capture lots more Northern Lights as we approach the Arctic Circle next week. I was also just informed that the caribou herd I&#8217;ve been wanting to photograph for years has finally made it to the Arctic Circle and I hope my visit coincides with their continuing presence. We&#8217;ll see.</p>

<p>My next blog will describe the Quest dogsled race, which just began today. It was one exciting, fun-filled event.</p>

<p>Until my next blog, try to stay warm.</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>Okay, I think I figured out the way for you to follow my &#8220;tracks&#8221; in the Yukon, all the way up to the Arctic Circle and beyond.</p>

<p>Click on this URL and it should take you to a Google map. Make sure to switch to &#8220;Terrain&#8221; view on the right side of the map, if it is not already there when the site opens.</p>

<p>This was Day 1, a leisurely drive southward toward Skagway, Alaska. The day was a photographic bust, since it actually rained (rather than snowed). But, from the Terrain map you&#8217;ll get an idea of the grandeur of the Yukon topography.

<p>I did get a slightly good shot from the highway, when the rain let up for a few minutes. By the time I got my photo stuff set up the best light had already faded. But, it gives you an idea.</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>So, right after I awoke to clear skies and no ice at all (see yesterday&#8217;s blog: http://blog.lesterpickerphoto.com/2011/01/31/delayed/), Air Canada managed to rebook me to Yukon so that I arrived pretty much the same day I was originally supposed to. I say &#8220;pretty much,&#8221; because I actually arrived in Yukon at 1:00 AM, but at least I was able to go out photographing with <a href="http://www.hartmier.com/">Richard Hartmier</a> after a few hours sleep.</p>

<p>The downside of my rebooking was that I arrived in Whitehorse, Yukon safe and sound, but my luggage did not. Thirty-five passenger bags were left in Vancouver for some inexplicable reason. I was able to get them by noon, though.</p>

<p>I&#8217;ve started using my SPOT GPS system, so you&#8217;ll be able to follow me in real time.. once I figure out how to link you to the correct site.</p>

<p>Our photo day was a bust in terms of images, but still a fun experience. It actually rained most of the afternoon! Now, we&#8217;re talking Yukon, folks. It should have been snowing. The temperature was a balmy 5C (41F), highly unusual this far north.</p>

<p><a href="http://blog.lesterpickerphoto.com/wp-content/uploads/2011/02/south-of-Whitehorse.jpg"><img class="size-medium wp-image-905" title="south of Whitehorse" src="http://blog.lesterpickerphoto.com/wp-content/uploads/2011/02/south-of-Whitehorse-199x300.jpg" alt="" width="199" height="300"></a></p>

<p>After a short nap, Richard picked me up again at 11:30 PM for a try at photographing the Northern Lights. Predictions at <a href="http://www.spaceweather.com">www.spaceweather.com</a> and the University of Alaska&#8217;s Northern Lights tracking site were for the start of a few days of good displays, but after two hours of standing around, waiting, a heavy layer of clouds moved in and we drove back to town.</p>

<p>Still, the experience was wonderful. The stars were so bright and close, you felt like you could just reach out and touch them. The temperature had dropped and the wind off Fish Lake was blowing steadily, but we were both dressed with layers and snow pants and a good parka. Then, in the distance, Richard was the first to pick up the howling of wolves. There is simply no way to properly describe the feeling of that sound, carried across the lake. Despite my layers, the howling gave me chills.</p>

<p>I get emotional at times like that, grateful for the opportunity to feel such a visceral connection to our natural world, but also keenly aware of just how fragile this tiny planet is, spinning within a nondescript galaxy in the immensity of the universe. It&#8217;s enough to make you wonder if we are wasting a once-in-a-universe opportunity to get it right.</p>

<p>I shared my thoughts with Richard, a curmudgeonly iconoclast if I ever met one, at which point he shared with me his deeply spiritual beliefs on the origin of our species. &#8220;It was a spaceship,&#8221; he says seriously, although in the pitch black it&#8217;s hard to see his face. &#8220;Just as they were passing earth they dumped their bilge tank. The conditions were just right. Voila, humans!&#8221;</p>
