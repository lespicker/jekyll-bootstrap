  <div class="entry-content"><p>In celebration of spring, I&#8217;m sharing with my blog readers some tips from my e-book series: <a href="http://shop.lesterpickerphoto.com/"><em><strong>The Photographer&#8217;s Eye</strong></em></a>. There are three books on shooting landscapes, wildlife and people. Each book includes ten images that serve as examples of various techniques  along with extensive shooting information. Each book ends with ten tips to make your shooting more effective.</p>

<p>If you’re shooting landscapes, one of the most effective means of adding interest and impact is to include a foreground element. A strong foreground helps bring scale and perspective to a scene. It can functionally help by drawing the viewer’s eye into a scene. It can create visual interest by adding texture, an interesting form, or a looming presence. It can even add cognitive dissonance by forcing the viewer to confront paradoxes in perception.</p>

<p><a href="http://blog.lesterpickerphoto.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/05/CanadianRockies2009-driftwood-in-lake-1-2.jpg"><img class="size-medium wp-image-2737" title="Impending Storm" src="http://blog.lesterpickerphoto.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/05/CanadianRockies2009-driftwood-in-lake-1-2-300x199.jpg" alt="" width="300" height="199"></a></p>

<p>How do you use foreground elements judiciously? First try putting them off center for visual interest, perhaps at the very edge of the frame. Next decide how much of the foreground-to-background you want in focus. I often use a special lens, called a tilt-shift lens, to give my images more depth-of-field, but if you have a tripod you can just move your aperture to f16 or even f22 to get maximum depth of field without hand shake. I nearly always use a tripod to keep foreground and background in sharp focus.</p>

<p>Want more advice on foregrounds? Check out this link to another of my blogs: <a href="http://blog.lesterpickerphoto.com/2011/03/08/foreground-is-forewarned/">http://blog.lesterpickerphoto.com/2011/03/08/foreground-is-forewarned/</a></p>

<p> </p>

<p>Happy shooting!</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>My next post will be from Italy, as I&#8217;m frantically cleaning equipment and going through my pre-assignment checklist of things to bring. I haven&#8217;t been to Italy in more than a decade, and even then it was only for a short stop in Rome. This trip I&#8217;ll be driving at the height of spring between Florence and Sicily, then flying the historic Ionian Sea to Malta, and then back to Italy for a few solid days photographing in Rome itself. Can&#8217;t wait!</p>

<p><a href="http://blog.lesterpickerphoto.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/05/italy-400.jpg"><img class="alignnone size-medium wp-image-2733" title="italy 400" src="http://blog.lesterpickerphoto.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/05/italy-400-262x300.jpg" alt="" width="262" height="300"></a></p>

<p>On the drive down south from Florence, I&#8217;m hoping to capture some images of the Amalfi coast, even though I abhor driving on crowded, winding, narrow roads with no guardrails and sheer drop-offs. If I chicken out (I&#8217;d give that around 90% certainty), I&#8217;ll hire a driver for that segment of my trip. It&#8217;s funny in that I don&#8217;t mind hiking narrow trails at altitude, but driving without guardrails and with steep drop-offs has always scared the daylights out of me.</p>

<p>I&#8217;ll be posting regularly here and on Facebook and Twitter, so please stay tuned. And, if you have any favorite Italy/Malta photo opps in mind, please share them here.</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>Here&#8217;s another photo tip from my eBook <a href="http://shop.lesterpickerphoto.com/">Photographing People</a> in my <em><strong>The Photographer&#8217;s Eye</strong></em> series. I call it: <strong>Get a Picture, Give a Print</strong>.</p>

<p>This is always a fun thing to do, if you intend to visit a location again, OR if you use one of the tiny new portable printers now on the market.</p>

<p><a href="http://blog.lesterpickerphoto.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/04/2006-11-ecuador17461.jpg"><img class="size-medium wp-image-2729" title="Winning Smile" src="http://blog.lesterpickerphoto.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/04/2006-11-ecuador17461-200x300.jpg" alt="" width="200" height="300"></a></p>

<p> </p>

<p>Once you get a subject to agree to allow you to take their picture- and often I end up making some great friends that way- I either send a print to that person once I get home or else bring one with me on my next visit to the country. In Ecuador, there is a market in Otavalo where I love to spend time photographing. When I go back, I bring prints of my subjects from my last visit and now the people are excited when I return. They even have my prints hanging on their walls.</p>

<p>This is a great way to make friends, influence people, and make the job easier for you on subsequent visits or for fellow photographers. I personally do not tip people for taking their photos, but I do show my gratitude by sending them something that I consider even more valuable. That respect goes a long way.</p>

<p> </p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>In giving you some photo tips from my e-books over the past two weeks, I had a regular visitor write to me asking about tripods. The question was mostly about which tripod would be best for his circumstances, but the conversation reminded me that I&#8217;d better slip in one of my most talked about tips and one that I revisit pretty regularly. Stated simply, if you want the Number One secret to improving your landscape images it is to simply use a tripod. Every pro landscape photographer I know uses one at least 90% of the time. To understand more of the reasons a tripod can help, <a href="http://blog.lesterpickerphoto.com/2010/12/15/tripod-or-lens/">click on a blog</a> I did a while back explaining why I use one about 90% of the time for landscapes.</p>

<p>In my case I use a big ole Gitzo 3541 with a Really Right Stuff BH-55 ballhead. It&#8217;s a monster to carry around, weighing in at 8 pounds, even though the tripod is carbon fiber. Add that to my other gear and I&#8217;m packing between 30 and 40 pounds when I hike into a pristine location to photograph. At my age that&#8217;s equivalent to maybe 200 pounds, especially on the way back to the car. So, it better be worth the effort. The plain fact is that it is.</p>

<p><a href="http://blog.lesterpickerphoto.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/04/LAP3024.jpg"><img class="size-medium wp-image-2726" title="_LAP3024" src="http://blog.lesterpickerphoto.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/04/LAP3024-300x199.jpg" alt="" width="300" height="199"></a></p>

<p>On my upcoming trip to Italy and Malta, which I&#8217;ll be blogging about starting next week, I did something I never thought I&#8217;d do. I bought a lightweight travel tripod. I can&#8217;t wait for it to arrive so I can test it out. Naturally, I&#8217;ll do a review of it once I put it through it&#8217;s paces in Italy. The thing weighs 4 pounds, including ballhead, so I&#8217;m not getting my hopes up just yet. Still, by my calculation, the tripod will be beneficial when I need to use slow shutter speeds.</p>

<p>For more information about shooting prize-winning landscapes, check out my <em><strong>The Photographer&#8217;s Eye</strong></em> e-book. They are only $4.99 and include 10 images, each of which illustrate a point, as well as ten tips for improving your landscape photography. If your preference is wildlife or people, I have ebooks on those topics, too. Enjoy!</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>In honor of spring, when you will undoubtedly be out there trying to make up for lost camera time, here is another tip, a simple but critical one, taken from one of my <a href="http://shop.lesterpickerphoto.com/">The Photographer&#8217;s Eye</a> e-books. This one is from my <a href="http://shop.lesterpickerphoto.com/page/103">photographing wildlife e-book</a>.</p>

<p>The most critical aspect of photographing wildlife is that you have the eyes in focus.  The fact is that an animal shot can be mediocre, but if the eyes are sharp, chances are people will probably like it. If the eyes are out of focus, no amount of composition or drama will help. This is especially important when shooting tight head shots with a telephoto lens. Always stay focused on the eyes.</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>To kick off spring photo season, here&#8217;s another tip from my <a href="http://shop.lesterpickerphoto.com/"><em><strong>The Photographer’s Eye Series</strong></em> </a>of e-books, this one about <a href="http://shop.lesterpickerphoto.com/page/102">photographing people</a>. This is a question I get often, during workshops that I offer, during Q&amp;A in lectures, even in casual conversation with other photographers. Do you get permission from people before photographing them?</p>

<p>As pros we have it drilled into our heads that we need permission to use an image of a person for commercial purposes. But for the amateur the situation is different. Or is it?</p>

<p>I firmly believe that it is a matter of civility, pure and simple, to ask someone you do not know for permission to photograph him or her. One of my pet peeves is the rude tourist who shoves a camera in the face of someone from a different culture. Of course, if the person is street performing that is a different story. But people have a right to privacy, and as a professional photographer I abide by that belief.</p>

<p>Permission does not have to be a signed release form. It can be a gesture- holding up your camera, pointing to it and to the subject and shrugging your shoulders as if to ask the question. Or, if you speak the language, just ask.</p>

<p><a href="http://blog.lesterpickerphoto.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/04/2006-11-ecuador1746.jpg"><img class="size-medium wp-image-2711" title="Winning Smile" src="http://blog.lesterpickerphoto.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/04/2006-11-ecuador1746-200x300.jpg" alt="" width="200" height="300"></a></p>

<p>In some countries, I’m thinking of Muslim countries in particular, photographing women without permission can get you in serious trouble. At the very least you owe it to your subject to give her a chance to cover her face.</p>

<p>Sometimes I admit to having photographed a subject surreptitiously, to catch a special moment or expression, usually at an event during which I cannot stop shooting or I will not come back with my assignment nailed. However, in that case I always go up to them afterwards, show them the images and ask if it is okay with them. Usually their smiling faces are their answer. If not, I delete the images right in front of them.</p>

<p>In <a href="http://shop.lesterpickerphoto.com/page/102">The Photographer&#8217;s Eye: People</a>, I have selected ten dramatic people images, explain how I captured them and offer suggestions for improving your people travel photography. I also have a section of ten tips that will bring your people photography to  the next level.</p>

<p> </p>

<p>Enjoy!</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>As part of my Spring Into Action month, I&#8217;m sharing some tips with you from my <em>The Photographer&#8217;s Eye</em> series. This one is from <em><strong><a href="http://shop.lesterpickerphoto.com/">The Photographer&#8217;s Eye: Landscapes.</a></strong></em></p>

<p>Today&#8217;s cameras are incredible miracles, really. In essence you are holding in your little hand a computer that would have filled a good part of a room just a few decades ago. One of the most miraculous capabilities of digital cameras is their ability to capture pretty decent images in low light. They do that by making the sensor extremely sensitive to light, the same way that different films were more or less sensitive to light.</p>

<p>In the old days, there was a trade-off. The more sensitive film was to light, the more &#8220;grainy&#8221; the resulting image looked. Today we call that graininess &#8220;noise.&#8221; The biggest difference is that newer sensors have made that noise less apparent. Note I say less apparent, not entirely removed.</p>

<p>Now, in most situations, you may not notice the noise in your image. Certainly you&#8217;ll never notice it on your camera screen. Up to about ISO 800 or even 1600  (a measure of the sensor&#8217;s sensitivity to light&#8230; the higher the number the more it is able to record images in low light) you&#8217;d be hard pressed to notice the noise even on a 15&#8221; computer screen.</p>

<h3>Here Comes the Noise</h3>


<p>But, as you blow up that image that noise becomes apparent. And few things ruin a dramatic landscape image more than noise. Sometime you may want that grainy effect for creative reasons; most of the time in landscape photography you won’t. The noise will be most prominent in the shadow areas of the image. As you blow up the image beyond a print size of 8.5 x 11, the noise becomes more apparent. At 12 x 18&#8221; it starts to bother; at 16 x 24&#8221;you find yourself apologizing.</p>

<p>The answer? Simply lower your ISO when capturing landscape images.</p>

<p>Many newer cameras have their &#8220;native&#8221; ISO set at or around 200. If that&#8217;s the case with your camera, then by all means try to keep your ISO at 200 (or below). Many cameras can handle up to ISO 400 or even 800 with minimal noise, but don’t count on it. However, to effectively use ISO 200 or below you will almost always have to use tripod. All other variables being equal, as you lower the ISO you must keep open the shutter for a longer period of time to allow in enough light. To prevent hand shake during exposures a tripod and cable release are critical.</p>

<p><a href="http://blog.lesterpickerphoto.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/04/LAP3080-2-Edit-2.jpg"><img class="alignnone size-medium wp-image-2701" title="Ramparts" src="http://blog.lesterpickerphoto.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/04/LAP3080-2-Edit-2-300x199.jpg" alt="" width="300" height="199"></a></p>

<p>Many landscape images require times of 1/15 second or slower.; for silky, flowing water, many seconds. In my twenties I could hand-hold a SLR with a wide angle lens and nail it at 1/15. Nowadays, not so much. I need a tripod for probably 80-90% of my landscapes. But the trade-off of carrying one around is that you can keep your ISO low. The result? You&#8217;ll have crisper landscapes with no &#8220;noise&#8221; at all.</p>

<p>The image here was taken just after sunrise at Rampart Pond in the Canadian Rockies, when the foreground and mid-ground elements were still in shadow. I used a graduated neutral density filter to hold back the sky, but I needed a long shutter speed to capture details in the shadows. By using a tripod, I was able to keep the ISO at 100, so that the image has virtually no grain at all.</p>

<p>So, for better landscapes, lower your ISO (and use a tripod and cable release).</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>Last year I was the honored recipient of the Canada Northern Lights Award for Best Travel Photographer.</p>

<p><a href="http://blog.lesterpickerphoto.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/04/Northern-Lights-Award-4-of-4-300x225.jpg"><img class="size-full wp-image-2707" title="Northern-Lights-Award-4-of-4-300x225" src="http://blog.lesterpickerphoto.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/04/Northern-Lights-Award-4-of-4-300x225.jpg" alt="" width="300" height="225"></a></p>

<p>This year the award went to National Geographic photographer Catherine Karnow. My hat is off to her and the fantastic work that Nat Geo does in upping the game for all of us. The end result? Better, more dynamic photography for readers worldwide.</p>

<p><a href="http://blog.lesterpickerphoto.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/04/gallery.jpg"><img class="size-medium wp-image-2706" title="gallery" src="http://blog.lesterpickerphoto.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/04/gallery-300x216.jpg" alt="" width="300" height="216"></a></p>

<p>The Canada Northern Lights Award is judged by one of the world&#8217;s top journalism schools, the University of Missouri School of Journalism and their panel of peer reviewers. It was a high honor for me to be selected last year and I wish the very best for Catherine and the entire Nat Geo team.</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>Spring means outdoors, which to me means being outdoors capturing images without going hypothermic. Spring also means that those wonderful, photogenic critters that have been holed up all winter come out to play, eat, sniff, eat, observe and eat some more.</p>

<p>In my wildlife e-book, <a href="http://shop.lesterpickerphoto.com/"><strong>The Photographer&#8217;s Eye: Wildlife</strong></a>, I share ten wildlife images that illustrate important photographic principles and explain how I got those shots. I also give ten tips that I feel are critical when attempting to snag images of wildlife that are keepers. Here&#8217;s #1 fro0m that collection of tips.</p>

<h3>Be Safe</h3>


<p>The first rule of wildlife photography is to stay safe. It sounds simple, but I have found that I need to do a mental safety check every so often because it is easy to lose oneself in the moment and forget the safety basics. Am I getting too close to the edge of the cliff in following that bird? Am I so absorbed in photographing those black bear cubs that I don&#8217;t know exactly where the momma is?</p>

<p>Always be acutely aware of your surroundings when photographing wildlife. Have an escape route mapped out in your mind. Never come between a mother and her babies (forget bears, I was almost pecked to death by an irate Arctic tern protecting its nest!).</p>

<p><a href="http://blog.lesterpickerphoto.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/04/LAP_5261-Edit.jpg"><img class="size-medium wp-image-2697" title="Gone Fishing" src="http://blog.lesterpickerphoto.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/04/LAP_5261-Edit-300x199.jpg" alt="" width="300" height="199"></a></p>

<p>If you do plan to photograph bears, a North American wildlife favorite, I strongly suggest having a trained guide with you, at least the first few times. Always keep a can of bear spray on your person. Practice and know how to use it so that if the occasion arises (let&#8217;s hope it never does!) you&#8217;ll know its limitations. Stay upwind when possible while photographing bears, so you can use the spray without it drifting back to you. That&#8217;s a very painful experience, let me tell you. Stay far away from bear cubs. An angered sow can accelerate to 30 miles per hour in seconds!</p>

<p>In the photograph here, I used a long lens to stay a safe distance from this bear. Even so, it got too close for comfort and I ended up grabbing my setup and walking away slowly, leaving all the the salmon just for him. If you click on the image and look at the claws, you&#8217;ll see why discretion is the better part of a good nature photograph.</p>

<p>Stay tuned for more tips this spring. I&#8217;ll be peppering my blogs with tips from my e-books on <a href="http://shop.lesterpickerphoto.com/">People, Landscapes and Wildlife</a>.</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>It&#8217;s spring again and most of us will be heading outdoors for picnics, hiking and other events that we share with family and friends. That means taking photos of people.</p>

<p>In <em>The Photographer&#8217;s Eye: People</em>, part of my <a href="http://shop.lesterpickerphoto.com/"><em><strong>The Photographer&#8217;s Eye Series</strong></em> </a>of e-books, I include lots of illustrative images, but also ten tips to improve your people pics. I&#8217;d like to expand on #3 here: Be Patient. Sound simple? It&#8217;s not.</p>

<p>Yes, we all realize that one has to be patient to photograph little tykes. But I find that the very same thing holds true for older children and adults. Often I find that it&#8217;s not until I&#8217;ve spent a sustained chunk of time with a person, photographing, then jawing, then photographing again before I land the image I want. Sometimes that&#8217;s due to the subject relaxing, but more and more I realize it&#8217;s probably due to me getting the crappy or mundane shots out of the way before I relax enough to get to know the subject and catch that magic moment.</p>

<p><a href="http://blog.lesterpickerphoto.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/04/A03_N_010.jpg"><img class="size-medium wp-image-2693" title="Bedouin Girl" src="http://blog.lesterpickerphoto.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/04/A03_N_010-217x300.jpg" alt="" width="217" height="300"></a></p>

<p>In the case of the bedouin girl I photographed some 12 years ago, I was the guest of the sheikh of the tribe as we visited various family groups. This young girl is one of the sheikhs many nieces. I was the first non-Egyptian she had ever met. I knew I&#8217;d need to be patient to get the shot I wanted. Two days patient, that is! As you can see from the marks on her cheeks, it took a bar of very melted chocolate (110F degrees) to coax her to even look at me.</p>

<p>I am not a proponent of &#8220;Drive-by Shootings&#8221; where you point a camera at an unsuspecting native and fire away. I think that causes more ill will than drones (ok, a bit of an exaggeration). But patience with people pictures is an attitude. Try to cultivate it, commit to it and you will see your images improve dramatically.</p>

<p>Stay tuned for more tips over the next few months, taken from my e-books (People, Landscapes and Wildlife).</p>
