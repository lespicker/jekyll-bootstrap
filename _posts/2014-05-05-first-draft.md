I'm happy to report to readers of my [First Dynasty Series](http://www.amazon.com/Lester-Picker/e/B009E6U9R0/ref=sr_tc_2_0?qid=1357444582&sr=1-2-ent) that I just completed the initial full draft of the third and final novel.

Few things can be as satisfying to an author, or at least to me, than finishing the first cut. We struggle for words, plot lines, character twists, real life interfering with our writing schedules... the list continues. But, then again, so does the writing. 

I'm also happy to report that I beat my self-imposed deadline of June 30 for Draft #1. That means I will have a bit more time to polish the manuscript as I typically take it through at least 3 more drafts before I consider it ready for prime time. I know that I write more slowly than many other authors, but I have to feel confident in the final story. If I can't love the work, then I don't want it "out there." Judging from the 4- and 5-star reviews, I do know that most of you enjoyed ***The First Pharaoh*** and ***The Dagger of Isis***.

I plan to spend a good part of the summer revising, so that the book is available in hard copy and e-book this Fall. I'll keep you posted on progress as I go along. BTW, the novel concerns itself with the last King of the First Dynasty and the ascension of the first King of the Second Dynasty, a period filled with transitions, upheavals and more. I hope I've woven together a great story, but it is you, loyal readers, who will ultimately decide. I'm looking forward to your reactions.
