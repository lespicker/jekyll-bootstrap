title: 	The Real Reason I Write

I was asked an incredible question recently by the founder of the hot new readers' website **Momma Says Read**. On the face of it the question was simple: What is the Real Reason You Write? 

<!--more-->

Whoa! Wait a minute. Not so simple, is it? She wants to know the "real" reason, not some spewing of platitudes. The truth is that I had to take a good deal of time out of my evening to sit and think this through.

In the end I discarded spoons full of pablum responses and instead dug deep into my "real" motivations for writing. If you are a writer, an aspiring writer, or an avid reader, I hope you will find my answer to that penetrating question interesting. I'd love to hear your comments.
