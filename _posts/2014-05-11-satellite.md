As if 2014 isn't already one of the most remarkable in archaeological history, with its incredible finds about Ancient Egypt, we now hear [news from National Geographic](http://news.nationalgeographic.com/news/2014/04/140425-corona-spy-satellite-archaeology-science/?utm_source=NatGeocom&utm_medium=Email&utm_content=pom_20140511&utm_campaign=Content) that thousands of ancient villages and towns throughout the Middle East have been found using satellite imagery.

Some of the cities are huge by ancient standards, which goes to prove the point that fiction often predicts the future. By that I mean that we novelists often paint a picture of a society using our imaginations and those paintings turn out to be more like photographs. 

As an example, take my novels [The First Pharaoh](http://www.amazon.com/Lester-Picker/e/B009E6U9R0/ref=sr_tc_2_0?qid=1357444582&sr=1-2-ent) and [The Dagger of Isis](http://www.amazon.com/Lester-Picker/e/B009E6U9R0/ref=sr_tc_2_0?qid=1357444582&sr=1-2-ent) (and the soon-to-be-released third novel in the series). In them I portray a vibrant Egypt (then called Kem or Kemet), trading far and wide with a host of small villages and towns along the Nile and beyond. Now we have proof that more than 15,000 such places existed in antiquity! 

Keep those exciting finds coming, folks!
