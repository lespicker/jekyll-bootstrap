On a recent hike in the spectacular Haleakala National Park on the Hawaiian island of Maui, I decided to do a quick video for you on how to create a panoramic image. 

<!--more-->

At the outset I have to apologize. I shot the video after hiking and photographing for several hours on a hot, humid day. It is also my first live, in-the-field video, so it is quite rough. Final apology: I wanted to include more of the actual how-to as I actually shot the pano, and I promise I will eventually do that for a pano session, but for this quick video I filled in some details with title pages within the video clip. 

The lead photo here is the image I ended up with. However, I did this after an exhausting day of hiking and photographing and so I intend to polish the image when I get back home. I'd love to hear your thoughts on the image and any suggestions you might have for final rendering. 

[Here, then, is the video clip](http://youtu.be/p4x63FrejkA).
