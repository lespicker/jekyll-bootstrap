Today I am **The Decider**. After reviewing my sales stats and researching this topic ad nauseum on the Web, I've decided to sell all my novels exclusively on the Kindle Direct Publishing (KDP) platform.

I know, I know. There is this whole exclusivity argument regarding Amazon. They are too big, too bold, too this and too that. But the facts speak for themselves, at least in my case. Over the past few months since my four novels went on sale, 95% of [my sales have been through Amazon](http://www.amazon.com/Lester-Picker/e/B009E6U9R0/ref=sr_tc_2_0?qid=1349273496&sr=1-2-ent).

By using KDP, I get some perks that I wouldn't have in any other publishing platform. For example, every time an Amazon Prime member borrows a book, I get paid. I can also put my book up for "free" days every so often, which stimulates interest, garners reviews and improves word-of-mouth sales. Besides, the beauty of electronic publishing is that as the other publishing platforms up their game I can simply increase my distribution platforms to  bring them into my marketing. Anyway, that's my story and I'm sticking to itâ€¦ for now.
