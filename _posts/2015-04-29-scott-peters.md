I was recently interviewed by Scott Peters, the wonderful children and young adult book author. Peters specializes in mysteries that take place in Ancient Egypt.

Peters' books are funny and absorbing, as his many fans will eagerly tell you. Peters' questions to me were fun, so I answered them in the same spirit. You can find the interview [here](http://www.egyptabout.com/2015/04/author-lester-pickers-cool-hat-and-more.html).

Take a quick read through it and, while you're there, why not order a couple of his books for kids on your gift list. They'll thank you!
