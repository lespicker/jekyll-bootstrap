Like I said in [my last post](http://www.lesterpicker.com/2014/05/01/new-findings/), 2014 is already one exciting year for aficionados of Ancient Egypt. The Petrie Museum of University College in London has just released a set of objects in their collection that have been scanned in incredible detail in 3-D.

You can imagine how thrilled I am as an author of Ancient Egyptian fiction. This allows me to grab an object and rotate it in space to get a feel for the item so I can describe it as appropriate. The 3-D scans are in the Beta stage right now and there are only a limited number of objects available, but I look forward to a growing number of artifacts being made available to all of us who are fascinated with this great civilization. 

Here is a screen shot of a sample artifact that I rotated.
