### I've Started on Book 3

With the publication of Books I and II of [The First Dynasty Series] (http://www.amazon.com/Lester-Picker/e/B009E6U9R0/ref=sr_tc_2_0?qid=1349273496&sr=1-2-ent), I simultaneously began planning for the third and final Book in the series.

Since if I told you what the third book is about I would have to send Apep priest assassins to kill you, suffice it to say that this tale will take the Series to new heights (at least that's my plan). 

I have developed an outline and fleshed it out, although I typically continue to add to it as I write. Next, I started on my character descriptions, which are critically important to me. That's where I add distinctive personality traits, quirks, behaviors and the like. Finally, last week I started in on Chapter 1â€¦ and came to a grinding halt!  I needed to add a new character. What would his name be? Will he reappear later and so need more fleshing out? Do I need to take out the trash right this minute honey? As they say, life gets in the way sometimes. Stay tuned for more.
