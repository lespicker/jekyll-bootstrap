There's a hot new website out there on the Internet frontier. **Momma Says Read** is a site devoted to getting people of all ages to read, write and review books of all genres.

At it's launch, I was asked by Momma herself if I would agree to be interviewed for her site. I agreed, not knowing just how thorough and delving she would be. In the interview we cover topics such as where I get the ideas for my novels, who inspired me, how writing effects my life, research, even my experiences living with a Bedouin tribe in Egypt. If you are interested in writing or a writer's life, I think you'll enjoy this [penetrating interview](http://www.mommasaysread.com/interview-with-author-lester-picker/).
