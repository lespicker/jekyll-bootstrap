The Internet is such a wonderful tool for authors. Naturally we think of its utility for research. But it is also wonderful for networking.

Thanks to the Internet I recently met fellow author Jack Durish, a veteran who has penned a historical novel that I would have never chosen to read, but that I am so happy I did. In *Rebels on the Mountain*, Jack weaves a tale of the Cuban Revolution, a topic I sadly knew little about. He introduces us to the real life Fidel Castro and his rag-tag Fidelista fighters, to Batista, Che Guevara and even to Ernest Hemingway! When I was done I needed to know more about Jack and his book.

**1.	What is the one book of yours you want us to read?**

**2.	Give us a one sentence synopsis.**

Nick Andrews, a U.S. Army spy assigned to unwrap the mystery of diplomatic failures in Cuba, avoids being entrapped in Castro's Revolution until he is forced to bury his friends and fight.

**3.	Pick a few characters from your book and tell us who you would like to see portray them in a movie?**

*Fictional Characters*:

Nick Andrews: A U.S. Army Ranger and Korean War Veteran who has made a career of reconnaissance patrols behind the Iron Curtain – possibly portrayed by Stephen Amell

Lucia Comas: An American-educated, island-born mulata, daughter of the second wife of don Carlos Comas, a Cuba sugar plantation owner, and love interest of Nick Andrews – possibly portrayed by Christina Milian

Emma Regan: An American socialite whose husband, a retired pediatrician operates a free clinic on the sugar plantation she inherited, and sister to the don Carlos Comas' second wife Sigourney Weaver

*Real Characters*

Fidel Castro: The charismatic leader of the revolution that overthrew the Cuban dictator, Fulgencio Batista – possibly portrayed by Jsu Garcia

Che Guevara: The Argentinian doctor who became one of Castro's most notorious lieutenants and his executioner following Fidel's rise to power – possibly portrayed by Guillermo Diaz

Ernest Hemingway: Nobel Prize winning author and Havana resident who mingled freely in the halls of power in Havana and purportedly supported Castro's revolution – possibly portrayed by William Hurt

**4.	Tell us about the story, but please don't reveal too much.**

Nick Andrews uses the cover of a pleasure trip with friends, the Regans – a retired doctor and his socialite wife who own an estate in Cuba – to infiltrate the island from its halls of power in Havana to the rebel camp in the mountains at the eastern end of the island. Unexpectedly, he rekindles a childhood crush with the island-born niece of the Regans, and makes friends with a loyal Fidelista rebel. Romance, rum, rumba, and revolution layer themselves into a tale of intrigue, action, and suspense.

**5.	What inspired you to write this book and how long did it take?**

I was slated to pilot a vessel from Galveston Bay to the Chesapeake, with a stop in Havana, when I was a young sailor, but the trip was canceled due to several factors including the fall of the Batista government in Cuba. I suppose that I never let go of the disappointment of missing that adventure. Thus, I followed events in Cuba closely and studied the history of the island and its people during the intervening fifty years. I spent another two years cataloging and studying my research, and another year and a half to write and edit the manuscript.

**6.	What other books have you written?**

Dream Pirates – Fiction for young readers with impaired reading skills and new English speakers
WordPerfect: Creative Applications – Technical manual
Infantry School: A Soldier's Journal – Personal memoir
Vietnam: A Soldier's Journal – Personal memoir
Trifles: Literary Dessert – A collection of short stories to be published soon

**7.	Which authors inspired you, your style?**

Many including...
Ernest Hemingway: Voice
Mark Twain: Irony
Charles Dickens: Memorable characters

**8.	Where can we learn more about you and your books (and how to follow you on social media)?**

**9.	Is there anything else you would like us to know?**

I am currently working on my second novel featuring Nick Andrews as a young soldier in the Korean War. Also, I have been posting to my blog a series of articles built from my research into Cuba with special emphasis on the love-hate relationship between the island and the United States. Most expect a change in US-Cuban relations when Fidel Castro dies, and Americans will begin looking forward to visiting this Caribbean paradise, which has been off limits for so many years.
