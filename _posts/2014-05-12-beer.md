One of my favorite finds reported this year stems from a dig by Japanese archaeologists working near present-day Luxor. It turns out [the elaborate tomb was for a beer maker](http://phys.org/news/2014-01-tomb-ancient-egyptian-beer-brewer.html) who lived at the time of the Ramses kings.

To understand how important beer was to the ancients, take a close look at the paintings on the wall of the tomb. The artwork is magnificent, reflecting the esteem in which good beer makers were held. Fro0m such paintings we learn a great deal about daily life in ancient times. 

In all of my [First Dynasty Series](http://www.amazon.com/Lester-Picker/e/B009E6U9R0/ref=sr_tc_2_0?qid=1357444582&sr=1-2-ent) novels, beer plays a role. Many a clandestine meeting was held over beer. 

So, here's to more finds by my Egyptologist mentors and friends! (Fade to picture of historical novelists hoisting a pint of Guinness).
