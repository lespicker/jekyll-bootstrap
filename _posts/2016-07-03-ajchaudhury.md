AJ Chaudhury just [posted his interview with me](https://ajchaudhury.wordpress.com/2016/06/28/interview-with-lester-picker/). I'm honored to be part of his youthful blogosphere, and hope that the tie-in brings some of that youthful enthusiasm to reading historical fiction.

AJ is an 18-year old author himself. I'm pleased that he has further opened my work to audiences in India. I have noticed that sales of my books have been increasing in India, so I believe that is an emerging market for Western writers, just as Indian writers have done well here in North America.
