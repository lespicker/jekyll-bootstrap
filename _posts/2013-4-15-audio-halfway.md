Exciting stuff. Adam Hanin, the narrator for my upcoming audio book on Audible.com just completed the halfway chapter! **The Dagger of Isis** is gaining momentum and should be ready for you to listen to and to treasure very soon.

Our hope is to have the book ready for you by early May. Judging from reactions to the prequel, **The First Pharaoh**, you folks are in for a treat. I love Adam's various voices, his acting ability, and his passion for the story itself. It shows in the way he approaches the work.
