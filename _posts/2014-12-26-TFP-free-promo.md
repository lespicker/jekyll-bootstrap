Great news! This week, December 28-30, I will be promoting my First Dynasty trilogy this week on Amazon with a FREE promotion of The First Pharaoh. That's free, as in zip, zilch, nada, gornisht.

***The First Pharaoh*** is the start of the series, which chronicles the lives of three of the most prominent Kings of that seminal and most tenuous period, when the very survival of Egypt as a nation hung by delicate threads. ***The First Pharaoh*** takes place around 3,150 B.C. in Ancient Egypt. It follows the life, loves, battles and court intrigue of King Narmer, the man who united Upper and Lower Egypt into one country and set the stage for one of the most marvelous civilizations in recorded history, one that lasted for more than 3,000 years! You can try ***The First Pharaoh*** for free as Amazon Kindle book and see if the series is for your reading taste. As of this date the book has earned an average of 4.5 stars from readers, something I am so pleased with. 

So, if ***The First Pharaoh*** has been on your reading list, here's a three-day chance to grab it and cuddle up against the winter's chill and transport yourself to a time 5,000 years ago (and a place that is warm and sunny). Just [click here](http://www.amazon.com/Lester-Picker/e/B009E6U9R0/ref=sr_tc_2_0?qid=1357444582&sr=1-2-ent) to get to my Amazon Author's Page. 

Once you are done reading The First Pharaoh, I do hope you will choose to review the book on Amazon and Goodreads. Reader reviews help both readers and authors. Even if you do not like a book (no book is for everyone's tastes), it helps readers to understand your issues before they buy. And, if you love The First Pharaoh, and I hope you will, sing its praises eloquently online and recommend it to friends. 

Best wishes to all my readers for a mostly happy and wonderfully productive 2015!
