We all do stupid things and sometimes make dumb decisions. So it was with me when I by-passed Great Sand Dunes National Park in my many previous visits to Colorado. Like I said, dumb and stupid.

This time I had to travel from Sante Fe, New Mexico to Boulder, Colorado and decided to stop at Great Sand Dunes for a quick late afternoon shoot, followed by a few morning snaps and then we'd be off. 

En route down the long, empty road from the highway to the park entrance I noticed the sun disappear behind some ominous clouds. It was already late and I figured that I was being punished for snubbing the park previously. But as we approached the entrance, the clouds thinned, painting the dunes in the sweetest, other-worldly light imaginable. I pulled over and spent the next 45 minutes shooting away. The image here is a quickie edit in Lightroom. I did not even touch the dunes themselves. All other adjustments are for contrast, clarity and a +.2 exposure in the clouds and along the foreground strip of grasses. 

The image was shot on my Nikon D800, with a Nikkor 70-200 f2.8 lens attached, all mounted on a flimsy travel tripod (never again!); ISO 200, 1/160 @ f11 with the lens set at 200mm. I used a 3-stop graduated neutral grad filter to darken the sky and mountain, allowing the dunes to be the focus of the image. 

The lighting was magical at this twilight hour. Compositionally, I liked the four or five layers, depending on what you count as a layer. The painterly effect that the light played over the dunes, combined with the D800's capabilities, made the image work for me. I can hardly wait to get back to the studio and post-process it carefully on my desktop.
