# Sri Lanka Workshop

## A Sampling of What Participants Have To Say

> Sri Lanka is a magical place with a colorful culture that provides many photo opportunities. Les and his wife Leslie are great hosts and provide an easy learning pace with as much help as you might want but no pressure. Les has a huge photography knowledge base but his knowledge extends well beyond photography. The pace is busy but not too busy, with opportunities to back away if you need extra down time. The setting is amazing but not just for the photographer also for a traveling spouse. <cite>Norm Arnold, New Mexico, 2015</cite> 

> The Sri Lanka trip was the most bang for the buck of any photo tour I have taken. The tour guide, Lester Picker, was knowledgeable, and full of information. Unlike many guides, he was there to make sure that the photo opportunities were available to the participants. On many tours, I think the tour guide is their only for a free ride to take his own shots! If you want to learn Lester is a great teacher. I would love to travel with him again. <cite>Will Randall, Florida, 2015</cite>

> The Nikonians workshop in Sri Lanka with Les Picker was my second Nikonians workshop with Les.  The experiences in Sri Lanka were outstanding.  Les worked with each student as much or as little as the student desired. He had planned to trip to optimize photo opportunities with a mixture of temples, nature, animals, landscape and people.  The tour company that handled the transportation, lodging and guides was excellent.  The lodging accommodations and dining were first class.  I look forward to my next tour with Les. <cite>James Harris, New Mexico, 2015</cite>

> Lester Picker provided us with an amazing experience in the wilds of Sri Lanka and in the splendors of Dubai. My purchase of a DSLR camera occurred a couple of months before the trip making me an absolute beginner. Each person on the trip offered me their expertise and by the time it was over I assimilated a wealth of knowledge. Les spent one whole morning in Galle instructing me, one on one, in composition. Exploring Negombo, climbing to the top of Sigiriya Fortress through the Lion’s Feet, hiking the to “World’s End”, basking in the sunshine with the tea pickers, fishermen, shop keepers, as well as, elephants, birds and leopards, along with Galle and its lighthouse and amazing beach hotel, was a delight. Dubai, with its glitter and architecture, created great photography. There was continual adjustment of activities and schedule to fulfill the goals of each individual.  The hotels and group eating experiences were priceless. The trip inspired great photographs but left us with acquired knowledge and amazing memories. <cite>Christine Durrett, 2016</cite>
