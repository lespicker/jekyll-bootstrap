## Past Workshops

### Acadia National Park, Mt. Desert Island, Maine

These 4-day workshops take place every October in Maine's iconic Acadia National Park. For landscape artists few places can beat it, with its rocky coast, evergreen forests, streams, lakes, waterfalls and moss-cushioned woods. (All images here were taken by workshop participants).

The Acadia National Park workshop is offered through [Nikonians Academy](http://www.nikoniansacademy.com/viewFacultyPage.html?page_id=7), where I am on the faculty. Registration is fast and simple.

Our itinerary looks something like this, subject to weather conditions:

**Thursday evening**: Introductions, orientations and an introductory lecture/discussion. 

**Friday, Saturday and Sunday**: two shoots in the morning (including sunrise) and two in the afternoon; evening critique session. Snacks and water are always available. 

**Monday**: morning shoot, wrap-up, and goodbyes at noon. 

Lunches and dinners are enjoyed together, over micro-brew beers, nice wines and lots of laughter and learning. 


Here are some comments from participants:

> I recently returned from a Nikonians workshop led by Les Picker at Acadia National Park. In a word it was outstanding. Les is an excellent teacher, photographer and leader. He was extremely knowledgeable about the Park and scouted out several beautiful photo venues in advance. He offered solid and comprehensive shooting tips geared to our individual needs and provided insightful feed back after each shoot. Perhaps most important he provided additional opportunity to review and improve our images after we returned home from the workshop. He was genuinely interested in our progress and it didn't end with the workshop. I recommend the workshop without reservation and look forward to attending another one with him.<cite>Lewis Rothman, M.D., New York City</cite>


>  I spent the better part of four photography-packed days exploring Mt. Desert Island under Les Picker's guidance. His depth of knowledge of the landscape, history and biology of the island informed our photography and took us to places that most other workshops just don't see. Les provided itineraries that were well-balanced between iconic locations and out-of-the-way gems. When the weather turned against us he led a stimulating, free-wheeling discussion in which all of the participants shared freely some of their favorite tools and photographic tricks. That afternoon we capitalized on the rain with a hike to a waterfall in full flow! Each evening we capped the day's work with a review of the day's events and Les' insightful critiques of a few of our images.

> Les proved to be a great workshop instructor. He was attentive to the varied skill levels and needs that all of us brought to the event and was readily available in the field to provide technical assistance and one-on-one teaching. I really appreciated his gentle challenges to try new things.

> To sum up, this was a great experience! Mt. Desert Island and Acadia National Park in the fall are unbelievably beautiful, and I can recommend it without reservation.<cite>Dave Soderlund, Ithaca, New York</cite>

> This workshop was a special experience at multiple levels: image creation, learning, and in the case of this particular workshop, enjoying the camaraderie of a diverse group of people that quickly bonded sharing their passion for photography and enjoying each others company. Les' in-depth knowledge of Acadia enabled him to guide the group to a diverse set of sites on a off the beaten path, sunrise to sunset.  His gracious style in sharing his artistic and technical expertise set the tone for the group dynamics. Post shoot discussions were nicely balanced between a focus on developing an eye for the creative image and technical/practical tips and techniques. <cite>Thomas E. Wilson, North Sandwich, NH</cite>

>The Nikonians Workshop in Maine, specifically to Mt. Desert Island in Acadia, led by Dr Lester Picker is an enriching, rewarding experience.  I suppose one could use the Internet to research iconic and remote photographic locations, make a list, and then try and do this sort of outing by yourself. But what you would be missing is Lester’s considerable experience and knowledge of the environs, the biology, ecology and geology of this unique area. What Les adds to the experience is what you are paying for, and you do get your money’s worth. His photographic experience is vast and going with Les lets you capitalize on all the wonderful ways he captures nature. His portfolio, speaks to this experience.<cite>Michael Neff, Virginia</cite>
