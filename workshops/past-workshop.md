## Past Workshops

### Acadia National Park, Mt. Desert Island, Maine

These 4-day workshops take place every October in Maine's iconic Acadia National Park. For landscape artists few places can beat it, with its rocky coast, evergreen forests, streams, lakes, waterfalls and moss-cushioned woods. Registration is fast and simple. (All images here were taken by workshop participants).

Our itinerary looks something like this, subject to weather conditions:

**Thursday evening**: Introductions, orientations and an introductory lecture/discussion. 

**Friday, Saturday and Sunday**: two shoots in the morning (including sunrise) and two in the afternoon; evening critique session. Snacks and water are always available. 

**Monday**: morning shoot, wrap-up, and goodbyes at noon. 

Lunches and dinners are enjoyed together, over micro-brew beers, nice wines and lots of laughter and learning.

### <a name="srilanka"></a>Sri Lanka

Participants call this 11-day photo tour of Sri Lanka the height of their photographic experiences. That’s no wonder to me. Sri Lanka is a mostly undiscovered, photographic jewel located off the southern coast of India. 

Sri Lanka boasts a warm climate, spectacular beach scenes, friendly and photogenic people, historical sites, architectural wonders, tea plantations, village culture and some of the best wildlife photography in the world (think elephants, leopards, bears, exotic birds and more).  And, for 11 intense days, we cover it all!

Here are some comments from previous participants, along with some of the images they captured during the tour. Looking for high photo adventure? Consider the Nikonians Sri Lanka photo tour, next slated for March, 2016.

> The Sri Lanka trip was the most bang for the buck of any photo tour I have taken. The tour guide, Lester Picker, was knowledgeable, and full of information. Unlike many guides, he was there to make sure that the photo opportunities were available to the participants. On many tours, I think the tour guide is their only for a free ride to take his own shots! If you want to learn Lester is a great teacher. I would love to travel with him again. <cite>Will Randall, Florida</cite>

> The Nikonians workshop in Sri Lanka with Les Picker was my second Nikonians workshop with Les.  The experiences in Sri Lanka were outstanding.  Les worked with each student as much or as little as the student desired. He had planned to trip to optimize photo opportunities with a mixture of temples, nature, animals, landscape and people.  The tour company that handled the transportation, lodging and guides was excellent.  The lodging accommodations and dining were first class.  I look forward to my next tour with Les. <cite>James Harris, New Mexico</cite>
