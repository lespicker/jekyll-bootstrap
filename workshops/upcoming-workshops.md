### <a name="portfolio"></a>Portfolio Creation Workshop
**Part of our Master Workshop Series**

{% img /images/bli/2016/12/DSCF7174.jpg %}

#### May 19th Thru 21st 2017

**A 2-1/2 day workshop offered by Moab Master Photographer Les Picker and Master Printer Robert Boyer.**

[**Register here**](http://workshops.lesterpickerphoto.com/page/810) *Limited To Four Participants*

> Learn the art of self-critique. Create a hand-made, cloth-covered, boxed portfolio showcasing ten of your finest images, offered in an elegant, state-of-the-art presentation and designed to advance your photographic goals.

#### The Bottom Line

**Top Ten Takeaways From This Workshop**

- Two-on-one consultation with two experienced, successful, professional photographers to help you curate and edit your work
- Assistance selecting and post-processing your best images
- Fresh perspectives on your own work and how to make effective editorial decisions
- Learn numerous strategies for dealing with your own editorial process
- A weekend of considered dialog with other serious artists
- Develop contacts for editorial assistance going forward
- Experience the value of outside editorial input on your work
- How the editorial process can shape your art
- Ten archival prints professionally printed on Moab fine art papers, using state-of-the-art Canon printers.
- Distinctive, cloth-covered portfolio box, hand crafted in the USA

One of the hardest things to do as a photographer is edit down your work to a cohesive collection of the best and most fitting images, whether it be to support a single theme, single project or the best representations of your work.

What serious photographer does not realize he or she needs to have a professional portfolio to show friends, potential clients, judges at juried shows, or to peruse for their own enjoyment?

In fact, a professionally curated portfolio is essential for success as a serious photographer. Images come alive when carefully selected, meticulously edited and printed on fine art, archival paper. Viewers appreciate the look and feel of museum quality prints.

Yet, in our experience we have found that the majority of photographers either do not have a portfolio to showcase their art, or the one they use is actually detrimental to their success. Unfortunately, photographic portfolios are often poorly planned, poorly curated, and even more poorly executed.

If you are a serious photographer, here is a chance for you to walk home with a beautifully hand-crafted, hand-printed, and carefully curated fine art portfolio that will show off your work to the highest standard in the industry today.

{% img /images/bli/2016/12/DSCF7227.jpg %}

#### Image Curation

Selecting images for a portfolio is difficult, but critically important. People naturally judge our work by what they see, so we must invest a lot of time in making selections. Frustratingly, we often spend too much time on images that we never should mess with in the first place! Editing an image to death is not the solution to developing your portfolio. Image selection, what we call curation, is the Number One priority. And in this workshop, you will learn to master that aspect of your art.

And how do we know when an image is portfolio worthy? Is it the number of "likes" we receive online? Hardly. On social media people most often say nothing as they flick through images a second at a time. Maybe they'll hit the like button here and there. But, what does that tell you? Nothing, really. Social media is simply not a good selection tool.

What about online photography forums? The Internet is an amazing tool, but not great for developing a portfolio. Every image can be critiqued to death, until there is no emotion left in it. Honest, trusted editing doesn't exist on the Internet, unless you are fortunate to have developed a one-on-one relationship with an experienced and respected photographer. Internet comments are often motivated by jealousy and competitiveness and can lower one's self-confidence.

Another aspect of online critiques that we do not favor is this: a photographer posts an image and the forum leader comments that s/he likes or dislikes it. Then the forum lemmings fall into line, creating an echo chamber of not-so-helpful criticism. Sound familiar?

#### Our Process: The Value We Bring to You

{% img /images/bli/2016/12/DSCF7160.jpg %}

Emotional attachment to one's own imagery clouds every photographer's judgment. Our process provides you with the combined judgment of Bob and I, mastered through decades of experience and professional success. Through our process you will gain self-confidence and understand the elements of solid portfolio development using professional critique to ensure you are showcasing your finest work.

> Les Picker and Bob Boyer are experts in different types of photography. Les is a nature, landscape and wildlife artist, while Bob is a studio photographer and master printer. In their eight years of working together, they often differ in their opinions about an image. They respectfully challenge each other, knowing that the passionate effort they put into it results in far higher artistic levels.

That commitment to excellence is at the heart of this process. We start with you sharing with us up to 50 of your top images. We will work with you to curate them and select 25 of your best. Those images can be thematic, project oriented, or a "best of" collection. We will provide you with detailed feedback and will discuss the curation with you by email and phone. And all this occurs even before you arrive for your first on-site session.

#### Your Professional Portfolio

We firmly believe that every aspect of your portfolio should  reflect your best work, with attention to detail. That is why we have our portfolio boxes individually made by hand in the USA by old-world craftsmen. These cloth-covered portfolios are works of art in their own right.

{% img /images/bli/2016/12/DSCF7198.jpg %}

We intentionally limit this workshop to four dedicated photographers, so that our attention to detail exceeds your highest expectations.

Prior to the workshop, we ask that you select up to 40 of your finest images and share them with us online (we will tell you how to do this). We will help you narrow that group down to 20 images prior to coming to the workshop.

Once you are on site, and after showing you some sample professional portfolios, we spend the rest of the day
Friday with you, helping you curate your images to the best ten images, in a collegial atmosphere where you can also seek input from the other attendees. We structure those discussions so that they are a positive and affirming experience and provide you with a template for utilizing positive professional critique in your future endeavors.

On Saturday we work side-by-side with you sharing insights, techniques, and Lightroom methods to finalize your selections while getting the most out of Lightroom. We'll also offer one-on-one assistance to post-process your images so that they shine and are ready for our state-of-the-art large format Canon printers. By the end of the day, you will have a selection of images that you can rightfully point to with pride.

{% img /images/bli/2016/12/DSCF7232.jpg %}

Sunday, together we print your images on large format, 13" x 19" fine art, museum-quality paper by world-renowned Moab Paper. We print using state-of-the-art large format printers by Canon, using archival inks. We add artistic finishing touches, giving you a beautiful, professional portfolio.

Afterwards you will assemble your portfolio. You will develop a cover sheet for your portfolio, which we will then print.  Then you will have the distinct joy of completing the physical assembly of your professional portfolio.

Finally, we will provide you with information on how to maximize your exposure on social media. We will discuss branding, how to collect material together, and how to create specific personalities in different social media. We will show you how to use images that do not make the final portfolio as teasers in social media. We will also cover how to document the process of making the work - what is known as BTS, or Behind The Scenes - as promotional material to drive viewers to your site.

We will also help you to understand how to best utilize your portfolio to improve your professional image, represent yourself to galleries, increase sales, and showcase your art to family and friends.

You will leave with your professional, hand-made portfolio and with the knowledge of how to use it and update it to keep it current.

Fee: $1,250. [**Register here**](http://workshops.lesterpickerphoto.com/page/810) *Limited To Four Participants*

{% img /images/bli/2015/04/image34-canvas.jpg %}

[**Register here**](http://workshops.lesterpickerphoto.com/page/803)

Are you ready to move your photo images from hiding in the dark recesses of your hard drive? Have you always wanted to share your best images with others? Would you like to decorate the walls of your home with your best photographic work? If the answer to any of these questions is ‘Yes’ then you should definitely register for our Basic Printing Workshop.

If you are like most digital photographers today, you have carefully honed your craft and have taken numerous awe-inspiring images. Now you are ready to display them on the finest photo papers for guests to see, to give as gifts, or to sell to those who appreciate your artistic efforts.

By the end of our one-day workshop, held in historic Havre de Grace, Maryland, you will not only learn a basic, color-managed workflow that is consistent and repeatable for fine art quality results, but you will leave the workshop with actual, large-format images, printed on fine art, museum-quality archival papers.

In the workshop you will print an unlimited number of proofs of  your best images. You will create large format prints. And, you can use any extra time to print as many other images as you want for simply the cost of materials.

And unlike virtually all printing workshops you will see advertised, we never accept more than six people, so you are assured of individual attention in a learning environment second to none.

### <a name="yukon"></a>Yukon Photo Adventure

{% img /images/bli/2015/11/V2Print.jpg %}

#### August 26 to September 4, 2017

##### Photograph Grizzlies, Landscapes, and the Amazing Northern Lights

Please [Register Here](http://shop.lesterpickerphoto.com/page/804)

### A Photo Adventure Like No Other

Prepare yourself for a truly memorable adventure as we photograph our way through Canada’s Untamed Yukon Wilderness from Whitehorse, Yukon to the Arctic Circle and back. Along the way we will witness the exotic arctic tundra changing into its dramatic fall colors right before our eyes. Traveling up the famed, graveled Dempster Highway, we will undoubtedly have opportunities to photograph trophy species such as grizzly bears, beaver, fox, and caribou. The luscious reds and yellows of the tundra light up the mountains and valleys during the day, making for incomparable landscape images.

{% img /images/bli/2015/11/DSC_3212-Pano.jpg %}

Our goal of capturing the perfect light means sunrises and sunsets spent behind our cameras. But the best light of all may very well be at night, as we mount our cameras on tripods to photograph the exquisite and magical Northern Lights.

{% img /images/bli/2015/11/Aurora-over-Yukon.jpg %}

En route, we will also spend time in Dawson City, epicenter of the historic Klondike Gold Rush. This quaint and historic town, with gravel roads, wood sidewalks, aboriginal culture and historic buildings, is tailor made for photography.

Lester Picker (www.lesterpickerphoto.com), has more than 650 credits in major publications such as National Geographic books and magazines, Forbes, Better Homes & Gardens, Time, Inc. publications and dozens of others. Les was given Canada’s highest photography honor, the Northern Lights Award for Best Travel Photographer, a peer-juried competition. Les’ blog (http://blog.lesterpickerphoto.com) is widely followed and often quoted by media.

Please Note: medical/evacuation insurance is required for this trip. Les will provide suggestions for vendors upon registration.

### Fragments From The 2016 Yukon Adventure

<iframe width="560" height="315" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/J6gjcn9rzjQ" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen></iframe>

Watch a few highlights and hear what participants say about the last Yukon adventure.

### General Itinerary

#### Day 1
All participants will be greeted at the airport and transported to the hotel (included in trip fee).

#### Day 2
After an early breakfast, we load up and take off for Dawson City, site of the Klondike Gold Rush. Dawson City is a gold mine (excuse the pun) for photography. The town itself has many national historic buildings and vestiges of the gold rush are everywhere. The Tr’ondëk Hwëch’in aboriginal culture is evident both in exhibits within their cultural center and in their living culture in Dawson City and the surrounding countryside. Later that night, conditions permitting, we will awaken you for our first opportunity to photograph the incomparable Northern Lights.

#### Day 3
Today we will wander the streets and alleyways of Dawson City, photographing its historic attractions and its people. We will drive to some of the major attractions from the Klondike’s Gold Rush past. At night, once again we will try to photograph the Northern Lights.

#### Day 4
We leave Dawson City and cross the mighty Yukon River to explore the views along the spectacular Top of the World Highway... and our first opportunity to see caribou. Tonight is also our first portfolio review, where you will have an opportunity to share your best images, ask for critiques or just participate in helping the others improve their photographic skills. If Mother Nature cooperates, we have another chance to photograph the Northern Lights.

{% img /images/bli/2015/11/DSC_3150.jpg %}

#### Day 5
It’s up and out before sunrise, as we drive up the rugged Dempster Highway, Yukon’s only passage to the Arctic Circle. We eat breakfast while on the road and stop frequently to take advantage of the amazing scenery as it changes from forest to tundra. The mountains and valleys of the tundra cannot be described, except in photographs. En route we will have opportunities to see beaver, fox, black bears, grizzlies, moose and caribou. This is truly a landscape and wildlife photographer’s dream.

{% img /images/bli/2015/11/_LAP1876.jpg %}

#### Day 6
After a night spent in Eagle Plains, we wake up before dawn for an Arctic Circle sunrise.  We will spend the day photographing north and south of the Circle, capped off by sunset images.

{% img /images/bli/2015/11/_LAP2863-Edit.jpg %}

#### Day 7
We travel back to Dawson City, once again photographing the landscape and wildlife as we go. We arrive in Dawson City for a late dinner. Northern Lights again, anyone? How about occasional grizzlies?

{% img /images/bli/2015/11/LAP_5261-Edit.jpg %}

#### Day 8
After an early breakfast we head back to Whitehorse. Depending on weather, we either head west to Kluane National Park or to Haines, Alaska.

#### Day 9
A day in Kluane National Park or Haines, Alaska, followed by dinner and a workshop wrap-up. This is an opportunity to share images and ask for critique.

{% img /images/bli/2015/11/Kluane-flightseeing.jpg %}

#### Day 10
Depending on flight schedules, we meet for breakfast and say farewells… for now. Transportation provided to the airport.


### Cost
The cost of the Yukon workshop is $8,500 USD per person, single occupancy. This bespoke adventure is limited to only 3 photographers.  

$3,000 deposit is due at sign up. Simply [click here](http://shop.lesterpickerphoto.com/page/804) to go to our Registration page.

Deposits are refundable until 180 days prior to the start date, minus a $250 fee. From 180 days to 120 days prior to the start date, 50% of the deposit is refundable. After 120 days the entire deposit is non-refundable. 120 days prior to the start date all remaining fees are due. A reminder will be sent to participants. If three people do not sign up, the trip will be cancelled and 100% of all funds returned.

All trip fees are quoted in US dollars and must be paid in US dollars.

[Register Here](http://shop.lesterpickerphoto.com/page/804)

### You Will Learn
We will spend each day (and nights in the case of Northern Lights) photographing landscapes and wildlife with individualized instruction from Les. You will learn about the sub-Arctic and Arctic landscape, geology, geography, natural history and culture of the Yukon. You will learn beginning, intermediate and advanced techniques for photographing landscapes and wildlife.

### What To Bring
You will be provided with a detailed list of what to bring. Medium format cameras are welcome, as Les is also an experienced Hasselblad digital photographer.

### What is Provided
The fee includes almost everything once you arrive in Whitehorse, Yukon, such as airport transfers, all ground transportation, all meals, snacks, water, lodging (single person occupancy), insect repellent, bear spray, etc.* I also carry a GPS with an emergency rescue beacon. Your friends and relatives will be able to track you on a web-based map in near-real time as we progress.

Once registered, I will provide you with a very detailed list of what to bring, what to expect and more.

*Costs exclude transportation to and from Whitehorse, Yukon, vaccinations, passport fees, tips, alcoholic beverages and incidental expenses.

### Special Notes
I emphasize that this is truly an adventure. Yukon is huge (20% larger land mass than California) with only 35,000 people (compared with California’s 35 million)!! That means we will be doing a lot of driving between Whitehorse, Dawson City and the Arctic Circle. It will also mean eating lunch from a cooler between shoots on some days. We will be using a rugged SUV, but things like flat tires are common. Weather is, of course, unpredictable and the sample itinerary above may need to be altered. Please note that cell phones do not work in most of the Yukon. Both men and women are welcome on this workshop.

Please do not book your air flights until we advise you to do so. You **must** also have traveler’s health and accident insurance.

To register, please [click here](http://workshops.lesterpickerphoto.com/page/801).

Some call it the most beautiful National Park in the country, a tiny gem compared to its larger siblings. Whether or not you agree, Maine’s Acadia National Park is an eye-candy destination for its combination of geology, flora, fauna… and weather.

Join me for a 5-day exploration of the exciting photographic possibilities in Acadia. We will explore its intimate coves and vaunted mountains, its pristine seashore and lush forests. We have also timed this workshop to take advantage of fall foliage with its resplendent colors.

Each morning we will embark on an adventure taking us to the fog-shrouded rocky coast or to photograph sunrise atop a mountain. We might hike a wooded path to capture sunlight streaking through mature pine forests, or photograph along one of Acadia’s picturesque fresh-water ponds.

Each evening we will have an optional image review and critique.

Les lived in Maine for ten years and received his doctorate in ecology from the University of Maine, using Acadia National Park for his research. Few photographers know the intricacies of Acadia as does Les.

Please [click here](http://www.lesterpickerphoto.com/workshops/acadia.html) for a sampling of what former Acadia workshop attendees said about the workshop.

### Workshop Fees

$1495, plus hotel, transportation, meals. The workshop is limited to 5 participants. Meals are at participants’ expense. Healthy (and maybe not-so-healthy) snacks and bottled water are provided as part of workshop fee. [To register](http://shop.lesterpickerphoto.com/page/801).

### A Photo Adventure Like No Other

{% img /images/bli/2016/07/9028991715_10ae1976d9_o.jpg %}

Myanmar (formerly Burma) is one of the most strikingly beautiful places on Earth, with lots of landscape, wildlife and cultural photo opps. I have crafted a private photo tour to Myanmar that is truly special.

By "private", I mean really private. I have been offered an opportunity to take just 5 photographers with me on this tour of a lifetime. The 14-day tour includes 13 nights accommodations in 4-star hotels and a 14-seater air conditioned bus just for our small group. All domestic flights within Myanmar are included, plus tons of extras.

I will be coordinating this trip with the same tour company that has coordinated my very successful Sri Lanka photo tours for the past few years, so I am confident this will be a very special event. I have included the itinerary below.

Perhaps the most exciting aspect of the trip is that we will be accompanied by world-renowned Myanmar photographer A.P. Soe. You may want to check out his imagery here.

The fee for the tour will be $7,250 and does not include airfare to and from Myanmar. A $3,500 deposit is required to reserve your spot. That deposit is 100% refundable until December 1, 2016. Final payment will be due on May 31, 2017.

Some call it the most beautiful island in Asia. Whether or not you agree, Sri Lanka (formerly known as Ceylon) is most definitely a sparkling, mostly undiscovered jewel for its combination of geology, flora, fauna, people, culture and tropical weather. Sri Lanka has enjoyed peace and prosperity since its insurrection ended several years ago. Food and accommodations across the country are excellent.

Join us for a 12-day (11-night) exploration of the unparalleled photographic possibilities in this island nation. Located off the southernmost tip of India, Sri Lanka is replete with some of the oldest Buddhist and Hindu temples in the world (many still in use), some of the friendliest and most photogenic people on Earth, and wildlife that rivals Africa’s best locations  − all at a fraction of the cost.

In this photography tour we will intimately explore Sri Lanka’s landscape, from vaunted mountains to its pristine seashore, from its tidy and colorful tea plantations to its lush forests.

Each morning we will embark on an adventure taking us from fog-shrouded tea plantations to cascading waterfalls, en route to photographing mountain sunsets. We will visit the country’s most picturesque temples and historical structures for architectural photos and opportunities to interact with Sri Lanka’s wonderful indigenous people. One of the highlights of the tour will be spending two days in famed Yala National Park, which boasts the densest wild leopard population on earth, along with bull elephants, crocodiles, water buffalo, monkeys and an incredible variety of colorful birds. Most evenings we will have an optional image review and critique.

Our air-conditioned bus will also have a certified country guide and a porter throughout the trip to help with luggage at each stop. Porters are also available inexpensively at each location for those who wish to hire someone to help carry photo gear.

The workshop will be led by [Les Picker](www.lesterpickerphoto.com), a professional photographer who has more than 650 published credits in National Geographic books and magazines, Forbes, Fortune publications, Better Homes & Gardens and dozens of other magazines and newspapers. [Les’ blog](http://blog.lesterpickerphoto.com) is widely followed and often quoted by media. Les received the prestigious Canada Northern Lights Award for Best Travel Photography. Les received a doctorate in ecology and has worked as a nature and photography guide in many locales.

Workshop is limited to 10 participants.

### Dubai Extension (4 days)
#### March 2018

{% img img-left /images/bli/2015/12/DSC_1158.jpg %}

Those of us who elect the Dubai extension will leave from Sri Lanka and fly directly to Dubai, the epicenter of the United Arab Emirates and one of the safest cities in the world. Truly a cosmopolitan city, Dubai has the most skyscrapers of any city in the world. Beyond that, city planners have given unparalleled freedom to architects. The result is a photographer's paradise, with angles, reflections, spiraling towers, and architectural landscapes that are unmatched.

But our tour will definitely not be confined to architecture. We will be visiting mosques, capturing images from many vantage points, markets of all types, beaches, and more. Plus, we will have two evenings of night shooting in Dubai's exciting public spaces.

We encourage our clients to book flights on Emirates airlines, as the stop-over in Dubai is free and no visa is required for Americans and tourists from several other nations.

The cost of the Dubai extension is $2,300 USD.
