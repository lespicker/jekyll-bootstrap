{% img /images/bli/2015/04/image34-canvas.jpg %}

##### Saturday September 26, 2015

[**Register here**](http://shop.lesterpickerphoto.com/page/803)

Are you ready to move your photo images from hiding in the dark recesses of your hard drive? Have you always wanted to share your best images with others? Would you like to decorate the walls of your home with your best photographic work? If the answer to any of these questions is ‘Yes’ then you should definitely register for our Basic Printing Workshop. 

If you are like most digital photographers today, you have carefully honed your craft and have taken numerous awe-inspiring images. Now you are ready to display them on the finest photo papers for guests to see, to give as gifts, or to sell to those who appreciate your artistic efforts. 

By the end of our one- or two-day workshop, you will not only learn a basic, color-managed workflow that is consistent and repeatable for fine art quality results, but you will leave the workshop with actual, large-format images, printed on fine art, museum-quality archival papers. 

In the workshop you will print an unlimited number of proofs of  your best images. You will create large format prints. And, you can use any extra time to print as many other images as you want for simply the cost of materials. 

And unlike virtually all printing workshops you will see advertised, we never accept more than five people, so you are assured of individual attention in a learning environment second to none.

Some call it the most beautiful National Park in the country, a tiny gem compared to its larger siblings. Whether or not you agree, Maine’s Acadia National Park is an eye-candy destination for its combination of geology, flora, fauna… and weather.

Join me for a 4-day exploration of the exciting photographic possibilities in Acadia. We will explore its intimate coves and vaunted mountains, its pristine seashore and lush forests. We have also timed this workshop to take advantage of fall foliage with its resplendent colors.

Each morning we will embark on an adventure taking us to the fog-shrouded rocky coast or to photograph sunrise atop a mountain. We might hike a wooded path to capture sunlight streaking through mature pine forests, or photograph along one of Acadia’s picturesque fresh-water ponds.

Each evening we will have an optional image review and critique.

Les lived in Maine for ten years and received his doctorate in ecology from the University of Maine, using Acadia National Park for his research. Few photographers know the intricacies of Acadia as does Les.

### Sri Lanka: Culture & Wildlife 
#### March 12-23, 2016

#### Photo Tour Description

Some call it the most beautiful island in Asia. Whether or not you agree, Sri Lanka (formerly known as Ceylon) is most definitely a sparkling, mostly undiscovered jewel for its combination of geology, flora, fauna, people, culture and tropical weather. Sri Lanka has enjoyed peace and prosperity since its insurrection ended several years ago. Food and accommodations across the country are excellent. 

Join us for a 12-day (11-night) exploration of the unparalleled photographic possibilities in this island nation. Located off the southernmost tip of India, Sri Lanka is replete with some of the oldest Buddhist and Hindu temples in the world (many still in use), some of the friendliest and most photogenic people on Earth, and wildlife that rivals Africa’s best locations  − all at a fraction of the cost. 

In this photography tour we will intimately explore Sri Lanka’s landscape, from vaunted mountains to its pristine seashore, from its tidy and colorful tea plantations to its lush forests.

Each morning we will embark on an adventure taking us from fog-shrouded tea plantations to cascading waterfalls, en route to photographing mountain sunsets. We will visit the country’s most picturesque temples and historical structures for architectural photos and opportunities to interact with Sri Lanka’s wonderful indigenous people. One of the highlights of the tour will be spending two days in famed Yala National Park, which boasts the densest wild leopard population on earth, along with bull elephants, crocodiles, water buffalo, monkeys and an incredible variety of colorful birds. Most evenings we will have an optional image review and critique. [See what other's had to say about Les' previous Sri Lanka photo-tour](http://www.lesterpickerphoto.com/workshops/past-workshop.html#srilanka).

Our air-conditioned bus will also have a certified country guide and a porter throughout the trip to help with luggage at each stop. Porters are also available inexpensively at each location for those who wish to hire someone to help carry photo gear.

The workshop will be led by [Les Picker](www.lesterpickerphoto.com), a professional photographer who has more than 650 published credits in National Geographic books and magazines, Forbes, Fortune publications, Better Homes & Gardens and dozens of other magazines and newspapers. [Les’ blog](http://blog.lesterpickerphoto.com) is widely followed and often quoted by media. Les received the prestigious Canada Northern Lights Award for Best Travel Photography. Les received a doctorate in ecology and has worked as a nature and photography guide in many locales. 

Workshop is limited to 12 participants.
