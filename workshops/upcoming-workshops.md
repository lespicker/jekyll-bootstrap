### <a name="printing"></a>Intensive One-Day Printing Workshop

{% img /images/bli/2015/04/image34-canvas.jpg %}

#### Saturday January 16, 2016

[**Register here**](http://shop.lesterpickerphoto.com/page/803)

Are you ready to move your photo images from hiding in the dark recesses of your hard drive? Have you always wanted to share your best images with others? Would you like to decorate the walls of your home with your best photographic work? If the answer to any of these questions is ‘Yes’ then you should definitely register for our Basic Printing Workshop. 

If you are like most digital photographers today, you have carefully honed your craft and have taken numerous awe-inspiring images. Now you are ready to display them on the finest photo papers for guests to see, to give as gifts, or to sell to those who appreciate your artistic efforts. 

By the end of our one- or two-day workshop, you will not only learn a basic, color-managed workflow that is consistent and repeatable for fine art quality results, but you will leave the workshop with actual, large-format images, printed on fine art, museum-quality archival papers. 

In the workshop you will print an unlimited number of proofs of  your best images. You will create large format prints. And, you can use any extra time to print as many other images as you want for simply the cost of materials. 

And unlike virtually all printing workshops you will see advertised, we never accept more than five people, so you are assured of individual attention in a learning environment second to none.

### <a name="srilanka"></a>Sri Lanka: Culture & Wildlife 
#### March 12-23, 2016

{% img /images/bli/2015/05/conde-nast-ocean-picker-2.jpg %}

[**Register here**](http://shop.lesterpickerphoto.com/page/802).

#### Photo Tour Description

Some call it the most beautiful island in Asia. Whether or not you agree, Sri Lanka (formerly known as Ceylon) is most definitely a sparkling, mostly undiscovered jewel for its combination of geology, flora, fauna, people, culture and tropical weather. Sri Lanka has enjoyed peace and prosperity since its insurrection ended several years ago. Food and accommodations across the country are excellent. 

Join us for a 12-day (11-night) exploration of the unparalleled photographic possibilities in this island nation. Located off the southernmost tip of India, Sri Lanka is replete with some of the oldest Buddhist and Hindu temples in the world (many still in use), some of the friendliest and most photogenic people on Earth, and wildlife that rivals Africa’s best locations  − all at a fraction of the cost. 

In this photography tour we will intimately explore Sri Lanka’s landscape, from vaunted mountains to its pristine seashore, from its tidy and colorful tea plantations to its lush forests.

Each morning we will embark on an adventure taking us from fog-shrouded tea plantations to cascading waterfalls, en route to photographing mountain sunsets. We will visit the country’s most picturesque temples and historical structures for architectural photos and opportunities to interact with Sri Lanka’s wonderful indigenous people. One of the highlights of the tour will be spending two days in famed Yala National Park, which boasts the densest wild leopard population on earth, along with bull elephants, crocodiles, water buffalo, monkeys and an incredible variety of colorful birds. Most evenings we will have an optional image review and critique. [See what other's had to say about Les' previous Sri Lanka photo-tour](http://www.lesterpickerphoto.com/workshops/past-workshop.html#srilanka).

Our air-conditioned bus will also have a certified country guide and a porter throughout the trip to help with luggage at each stop. Porters are also available inexpensively at each location for those who wish to hire someone to help carry photo gear.

The workshop will be led by [Les Picker](www.lesterpickerphoto.com), a professional photographer who has more than 650 published credits in National Geographic books and magazines, Forbes, Fortune publications, Better Homes & Gardens and dozens of other magazines and newspapers. [Les’ blog](http://blog.lesterpickerphoto.com) is widely followed and often quoted by media. Les received the prestigious Canada Northern Lights Award for Best Travel Photography. Les received a doctorate in ecology and has worked as a nature and photography guide in many locales. 

Workshop is limited to 12 participants.

### <a name="yukon"></a>Yukon Photo Adventure 
#### August 27 to September 4, 2016

# A Photo Adventure Like No Other: Canada’s Untamed Yukon Wilderness 
## Photograph Grizzlies, Landscapes, and the Amazing Northern Lights

{% img /images/bli/2015/11/V2Print.jpg %}

Please [Register Here](http://shop.lesterpickerphoto.com/page/804)

### Description
Prepare yourself for a truly memorable adventure as we photograph our way from Whitehorse, Yukon to the Arctic Circle and back. Along the way we will witness the exotic arctic tundra changing into its dramatic fall colors right before our eyes. Traveling up the famed, graveled Dempster Highway, we will undoubtedly have opportunities to photograph trophy species such as grizzly bears, beaver, fox, and caribou. The luscious reds and yellows of the tundra light up the mountains and valleys during the day, making for incomparable landscape images. 

{% img /images/bli/2015/11/DSC_3212-Pano.jpg %}

Our goal of capturing the perfect light means sunrises and sunsets spent behind our cameras. But the best light of all may very well be at night, as we mount our cameras on tripods to photograph the exquisite and magical Northern Lights. 

{% img /images/bli/2015/11/Aurora-over-Yukon.jpg %}

En route, we will also spend time in Dawson City, epicenter of the historic Klondike Gold Rush. This quaint and historic town, with gravel roads, wood sidewalks, aboriginal culture and historic buildings, is tailor made for photography. 

Lester Picker (www.lesterpickerphoto.com), has more than 650 credits in major publications such as National Geographic books and magazines, Forbes, Better Homes & Gardens, Time, Inc. publications and dozens of others. Les was given Canada’s highest photography honor, the Northern Lights Award for Best Travel Photographer, a peer-juried competition. Les’ blog (http://blog.lesterpickerphoto.com) is widely followed and often quoted by media. 

For sample comments and testimonials from previous Yukon photo tours, please [click here](http://www.lesterpickerphoto.com/workshops/yukon-tes.html).


### General Itinerary

#### Day 1
All participants will be greeted at the airport and transported to the hotel (included in trip fee). 

#### Day 2
After an early breakfast, we load up and take off for Dawson City, site of the Klondike Gold Rush. Dawson City is a gold mine (excuse the pun) for photography. The town itself has many national historic buildings and vestiges of the gold rush are everywhere. The Tr’ondëk Hwëch’in aboriginal culture is evident both in exhibits within their cultural center and in their living culture in Dawson City and the surrounding countryside. Later that night, conditions permitting, we will awaken you for our first opportunity to photograph the incomparable Northern Lights. 

#### Day 3
Today we will wander the streets and alleyways of Dawson City, photographing its historic attractions and its people. We will drive to some of the major attractions from the Klondike’s Gold Rush past. At night, once again we will try to photograph the Northern Lights. 

#### Day 4
We leave Dawson City and cross the mighty Yukon River to explore the views along the spectacular Top of the World Highway... and our first opportunity to see caribou. Tonight is also our first portfolio review, where you will have an opportunity to share your best images, ask for critiques or just participate in helping the others improve their photographic skills. If Mother Nature cooperates, we have another chance to photograph the Northern Lights.

{% img /images/bli/2015/11/DSC_3150.jpg %}

#### Day 5
It’s up and out before sunrise, as we drive up the rugged Dempster Highway, Yukon’s only passage to the Arctic Circle. We eat breakfast while on the road and stop frequently to take advantage of the amazing scenery as it changes from forest to tundra. The mountains and valleys of the tundra cannot be described, except in photographs. En route we will have opportunities to see beaver, fox, black bears, grizzlies, moose and caribou. This is truly a landscape and wildlife photographer’s dream. 

{% img /images/bli/2015/11/_LAP1876.jpg %}

#### Day 6
After a night spent in Eagle Plains, we wake up before dawn for an Arctic Circle sunrise.  We will spend the day photographing north and south of the Circle, capped off by sunset images. 

{% img /images/bli/2015/11/_LAP2863-Edit.jpg %}

#### Day 7
We travel back to Dawson City, once again photographing the landscape and wildlife as we go. We arrive in Dawson City for a late dinner. Northern Lights again, anyone? How about occasional grizzlies?

{% img /images/bli/2015/11/LAP_5261-Edit.jpg %}

#### Day 8
After an early breakfast we head back to Whitehorse. Depending on weather, we either head west to Kluane National Park or to Haines, Alaska. 

#### Day 9
A day in Kluane National Park or Haines, Alaska, followed by dinner and a workshop wrap-up. This is an opportunity to share images and ask for critique.

{% img /images/bli/2015/11/Kluane-flightseeing.jpg %}

#### Day 10
Depending on flight schedules, we meet for breakfast and say farewells… for now. Transportation provided to the airport.

[Register Here](http://shop.lesterpickerphoto.com/page/804)

### You Will Learn
We will spend each day (and nights in the case of Northern Lights) photographing landscapes and wildlife with individualized instruction from Les. You will learn about the sub-Arctic and Arctic landscape, geology, geography, natural history and culture of the Yukon. You will learn beginning, intermediate and advanced techniques for photographing landscapes and wildlife. 

### What To Bring
You will be provided with a detailed list of what to bring. Medium format cameras are welcome, as Les is also an experienced Hasselblad digital photographer. 

### What is Provided
The fee includes almost everything once you arrive in Whitehorse, Yukon, such as airport transfers, all ground transportation, all meals, snacks, water, lodging (single person occupancy), insect repellent, bear spray, etc.* I also carry a GPS with an emergency rescue beacon. Your friends and relatives will be able to track you on a web-based map in near-real time as we progress. 

Once registered, I will provide you with a very detailed list of what to bring, what to expect and more. 

*Costs exclude transportation to and from Whitehorse, Yukon, vaccinations, passport fees, tips, alcoholic beverages and incidental expenses. 

### Special Notes
I emphasize that this is truly an adventure. Yukon is huge (20% larger land mass than California) with only 35,000 people (compared with California’s 35 million)!! That means we will be doing a lot of driving between Whitehorse, Dawson City and the Arctic Circle. It will also mean eating lunch from a cooler between shoots on some days. We will be using a rugged SUV, but things like flat tires are common. Weather is, of course, unpredictable and the sample itinerary above may need to be altered. Please note that cell phones do not work in most of the Yukon. Both men and women are welcome on this workshop. 

Please do not book your air flights until we advise you to do so. You must also have traveler’s health and accident insurance.

Some call it the most beautiful National Park in the country, a tiny gem compared to its larger siblings. Whether or not you agree, Maine’s Acadia National Park is an eye-candy destination for its combination of geology, flora, fauna… and weather.

Each evening we will have an optional image review and critique.

Les lived in Maine for ten years and received his doctorate in ecology from the University of Maine, using Acadia National Park for his research. Few photographers know the intricacies of Acadia as does Les.
