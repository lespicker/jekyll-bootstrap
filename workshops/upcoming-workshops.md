Some call it the most beautiful National Park in the country, a tiny gem compared to its larger siblings. Whether or not you agree, Maine’s Acadia National Park is an eye-candy destination for its combination of geology, flora, fauna… and weather.

Join me for a 4-day exploration of the exciting photographic possibilities in Acadia. We will explore its intimate coves and vaunted mountains, its pristine seashore and lush forests. We have also timed this workshop to take advantage of fall foliage with its resplendent colors.

Each morning we will embark on an adventure taking us to the fog-shrouded rocky coast or to photograph sunrise atop a mountain. We might hike a wooded path to capture sunlight streaking through mature pine forests, or photograph along one of Acadia’s picturesque fresh-water ponds.

Each evening we will have an optional image review and critique.

Les lived in Maine for ten years and received his doctorate in ecology from the University of Maine, using Acadia National Park for his research. Few photographers know the intricacies of Acadia as does Les.

#### March 12-23, 2016

#### Photo Tour Description

Some call it the most beautiful island in Asia. Whether or not you agree, Sri Lanka (formerly known as Ceylon) is most definitely a sparkling, mostly undiscovered jewel for its combination of geology, flora, fauna, people, culture and tropical weather. Sri Lanka has enjoyed peace and prosperity since its insurrection ended several years ago. Food and accommodations across the country are excellent. 

Join us for a 12-day (11-night) exploration of the unparalleled photographic possibilities in this island nation. Located off the southernmost tip of India, Sri Lanka is replete with some of the oldest Buddhist and Hindu temples in the world (many still in use), some of the friendliest and most photogenic people on Earth, and wildlife that rivals Africa’s best locations  − all at a fraction of the cost. 

In this photography tour we will intimately explore Sri Lanka’s landscape, from vaunted mountains to its pristine seashore, from its tidy and colorful tea plantations to its lush forests. 

Each morning we will embark on an adventure taking us from fog-shrouded tea plantations to cascading waterfalls, en route to photographing mountain sunsets. We will visit the country’s most picturesque temples and historical structures for architectural photos and opportunities to interact with Sri Lanka’s wonderful indigenous people. One of the highlights of the tour will be spending two days in famed Yalla National Park, which boasts the densest wild leopard population on earth, along with bull elephants, crocodiles, water buffalo, monkeys and an incredible variety of colorful birds. Most evenings we will have an optional image review and critique. 

Our air-conditioned bus will also have a certified country guide and a porter throughout the trip to help with luggage at each stop. Porters are also available inexpensively at each location for those who wish to hire someone to help carry photo gear.

The workshop will be led by [Les Picker](www.lesterpickerphoto.com), a professional photographer who has more than 650 published credits in National Geographic books and magazines, Forbes, Fortune publications, Better Homes & Gardens and dozens of other magazines and newspapers. [Les’ blog](http://blog.lesterpickerphoto.com) is widely followed and often quoted by media. Les received the prestigious Canada Northern Lights Award for Best Travel Photography. Les received a doctorate in ecology and has worked as a nature and photography guide in many locales. 

Workshop is limited to 12 participants.
