Some call it the most beautiful National Park in the country, a tiny gem compared to its larger siblings. Whether or not you agree, Maine’s Acadia National Park is an eye-candy destination for its combination of geology, flora, fauna… and weather.

Join me for a 4-day exploration of the exciting photographic possibilities in Acadia. We will explore its intimate coves and vaunted mountains, its pristine seashore and lush forests. We have also timed this workshop to take advantage of fall foliage with its resplendent colors.

Each morning we will embark on an adventure taking us to the fog-shrouded rocky coast or to photograph sunrise atop a mountain. We might hike a wooded path to capture sunlight streaking through mature pine forests, or photograph along one of Acadia’s picturesque fresh-water ponds.

Each evening we will have an optional image review and critique.

Les lived in Maine for ten years and received his doctorate in ecology from the University of Maine, using Acadia National Park for his research. Few photographers know the intricacies of Acadia as does Les.

### Workshop Fees

$1095, plus hotel, transportation, meals. The workshop is limited to 10 participants. Meals are at participants’ expense. Healthy snacks and bottled water are provided as part of workshop fee. To register, [**click here**](http://shop.lesterpickerphoto.com/page/801).

### [Sri Lanka: Culture & Wildlife](http://www.nikoniansacademy.com/all/viewWorkshop.html?course_id=1318) 
#### Mid-March, 2016

{% img /images/2012/11/DSC_1881.jpg %}

Some call it the most beautiful island in Asia. Whether or not you agree, Sri Lanka (formerly known as Ceylon) is a sparkling jewel for its combination of geology, flora, fauna, people, culture and tropical weather. Sri Lanka has enjoyed peace and prosperity since its insurrection ended several years ago. Food and accommodations across the country are excellent.

This is a 10-day (9-night) exploration of the unparalleled photographic possibilities in this island nation. Sri Lanka is replete with some of the oldest Buddhist and Hindu temples in the world, some of the friendliest and most photogenic people on Earth, and wildlife that rivals Africa’s best locations  − all at a fraction of the cost. In this photography tour we will intimately explore Sri Lanka’s landscape, from vaunted mountains to its pristine seashore, from its tidy and colorful tea plantations to its lush forests.

Each morning we will embark on an adventure taking us from fog-shrouded tea plantations to cascading waterfalls, en route to photographing mountain sunsets. We will visit the country’s most picturesque temples and historical structures for architectural photos and opportunities to interact with Sri Lanka’s wonderful indigenous people. One of the highlights of the tour will be spending two days in famed Yalla National Park, which boasts the densest wild leopard population on earth, along with bull elephants, crocodiles, water buffalo, monkeys and an incredible variety of colorful birds.
