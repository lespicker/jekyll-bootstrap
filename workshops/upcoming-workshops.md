Some call it the most beautiful National Park in the country, a tiny gem compared to its larger siblings. Whether or not you agree, Maine’s Acadia National Park is an eye-candy destination for its combination of geology, flora, fauna… and weather.

Join me for a 4-day exploration of the exciting photographic possibilities in Acadia. We will explore its intimate coves and vaunted mountains, its pristine seashore and lush forests. We have also timed this workshop to take advantage of fall foliage with its resplendent colors.

Each morning we will embark on an adventure taking us to the fog-shrouded rocky coast or to photograph sunrise atop a mountain. We might hike a wooded path to capture sunlight streaking through mature pine forests, or photograph along one of Acadia’s picturesque fresh-water ponds.For more information and to register, [click here](http://www.nikoniansacademy.com/all/viewWorkshop.html?course_id=1057).
