## Capture-To-Print Workshop Description

Some call it the most beautiful National Park in the country, a tiny gem compared to its larger siblings. Whether or not you agree, Maine’s Acadia National Park is most definitely a sparkling jewel for its combination of geology, flora, fauna… and weather. 

Join us for a 4-day capture-to-print exploration of the exciting photographic possibilities in Acadia. In the field we will explore its intimate coves and vaunted mountains, its pristine seashore and lush forests, its lakes, stream and moss forests. In the studio you will learn workflow shortcuts, polish your post-processing skills, and learn the secrets of producing stunning fine art prints.  We have timed this workshop to take advantage of Fall foliage with its resplendent colors, so that you will go home ready to frame and hang your gallery prints.

## Workshop Format

Each morning we will embark on an adventure taking us to the fog-shrouded rocky coast or to hike a wooded path to capture sunlight streaking through mature pine forests. We will photograph along one of Acadia’s photogenic fresh-water ponds or streams. Lush moss-carpeted forests and picturesque lighthouses all await us!

Each afternoon and evening we will learn about workflow strategies, post-processing, with the goal of creating fine art prints on various museum-quality Museo Fine Art papers. 

The workshop will be led by [Les Picker](http://www.lesterpickerphoto.com), a Nikonians Academy faculty member and professional photographer who has more than 600 published credits in National Geographic books and magazines, Forbes, Fortune publications, Better Homes & Gardens and dozens of other magazines and newspapers. [Les’ blog](http://blog.lesterpickerphoto.com) is widely followed and often quoted by media. In 2011, Les won the prestigious Canada Northern Lights Award for Best Travel Photographer. 

Les lived in Maine for ten years and received his doctorate in ecology from the University of Maine, using Acadia National Park for his research. Few photographers know the intricacies of Acadia as does Les. 

Robert Boyer is a Master Printer and studio photographer. Working with Les, Bob’s prints are displayed in galleries, offices, hospitals and homes. Bob is an expert in workflow, post-processing (Lightroom, Aperture and PhotoShop), and printing. 

Due to its intensity, the workshop is limited to 12 participants. Meals and lodging are at participants’ expense. Snacks, bottled water, coffee and tea are provided as part of the workshop fee.

Participants will leave the workshop with:

- Improved workflow, post-processing and printing skills- Finished prints (up to 13” x 19”) on Museo Fine Art papers 
- A packet of assorted Museo papers and canvas 
- Discount coupon for their first post-workshop purchase of Museo products
- Discount coupon for purchase of Canon printers
