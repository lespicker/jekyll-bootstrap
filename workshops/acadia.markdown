# Acadia Workshop

## What Participants Have To Say
### 2015 Workshop 

> In October 2015, I spent five days in one of the most beautiful places in the United States -- Acadia National Park in Maine. This workshop was led by Nikonian and internationally known photographer Les Picker. Fall in New England is great, but fall at the time of peak color in Acadia is the best! It covers streams to oceans, woodlands and wetlands, mountains, forests and coastlines. And Les knows this place like the back of his hand, having lived and worked in Maine for a good part of his life.
> Equally important to me was Lesâ€™s organization of the trip and his dedication to teaching photography to his students. Les left no time unused. Most of the work, of course, was in the field, but he also gave us thoughtful video presentations of his work covering topics like Composition and Travel Photography. Moreover, Les was always available to help his students. He is not one of those photographers who spends all his time taking his own pictures during the workshop trying to make money while his students suffer. He knows that his number one job is to help and teach students. Only occasionally on our workshop did he shoot, and then, for the most part, it was Les showing the group how a professional does his work. This allowed us to look at his technique and even into his camera to see what he sees as he goes about his job. In summary, this workshop setting was beautiful and Les made the most of it. For me, It was an inspiring time. <cite>David Johnson</cite>

> I recently spent four busy days in Acadia National Park on a photo seminar with Les Picker. Les is a highly accomplished professional photographer and a wonderful teacher. He is also a true expert when it comes to knowing where and when to take photos in Acadia and on Mount Desert Island. Les has been photographing Acadia for more than 30 years, and he knows all the back trails and hidden treasures there.

> Les offered many practical tips and techniques for improving his students' photography, and he dedicated himself to helping his students. I have other attended workshops with various pro photographers, and some of those pros seem to dedicate most of their time taking photos for themselves. In Acadia I did not see Les take a single photo; instead he was constantly working with his students to help them improve their skills and capture their own incredible images.

> To sum it up, Les' Acadia workshop was a wonderful experience. Acadia is incredibly beautiful, and I have some wonderful memories and images that I will treasure. <cite>John Sternbergh, North Carolina </cite>
