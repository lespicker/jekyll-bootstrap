### What Makes Les' Workshops Special?

Les offers customized photo workshops for small groups of photographers. What differentiates Les' workshops are his experience as a widely published photographer, his commitment to small groups, his personal attention to the needs of participants, his excellent instruction, and the quality time spent onsite at iconic and off-the-beaten-path locales. 

In Les' workshops there are never more than 10 participants and some workshops are limited to fewer. This allows him to devote quality time to each participant. 

Les has won several honors for his teaching, first when he was chosen by his peers as one of Maine's Science Teachers of the Year. While teaching at the University of Delaware, he was named Best Undergraduate Teacher in his college. 

Les' photography has been featured in many publications and shows. He was named Best Travel Photographer for 2011 by the prestigious Canada Northern Lights Award. His work decorates hospitals, offices and private homes. 

Les believes in the learning-by-doing model. As much time as possible is spent in the field actually capturing images. Evening critiques and instruction are considered the highlight of Les' workshops by many participants. Les also photographs when his participants are not in direct need of his help. At times like those, participants are invited to watch, ask questions, and learn how Les solves photographic challenges in the field.  

And, as Les' workshop participants have found, their association with Les lasts far beyond the workshop. Les follows the development of his participants, answering their photo questions, even meeting with them or inviting them on an unstructured shoot when he is in their area, long after the workshop ends. 

The places Les chooses for his workshops are as unique as is Les' instructional techniques. Acadia National Park? Not as most people know it! Les did his doctoral research here and knows places that only he can get to! The Yukon Territory? Les has been there many times and knows it so well his participants get to photograph places not available to tourists. Sri Lanka? Les' contacts make for a smooth tour that integrates wildlife, historic sites, landscapes and people into a travel package that will be the envy of your friends. And so it goes with workshops that Les elects to teach. 

### Two Ways to Workshop

At Les Picker Fine Art Photography, we offer two distinct varieties of workshops. 

**Field Workshops**

Les' field workshops last from two to nine days, depending on location. These intense workshops are structured to maximize field time.  Some are offered through the [Nikonians Academy](http://www.nikoniansacademy.com/viewFacultyPage.html?page_id=7), where Les is on the faculty, while others are offered exclusively through Les Picker Fine Art Photography. Each evening there is a critique or instructional session designed to impart new skills, gain new perspectives and share participants' knowledge of and enthusiasm for photography. 

Locations include Acadia National Park (Maine, USA), New Mexico (USA), Yukon Territory (Canada), Sri Lanka, and other idyllic locations.


**Field-Print Workshops**

These are currently weekend workshops designed to bring solid images from conception to camera capture to display. The first evening is spent on introductions, goals and a presentation by Les and his assistant, Master Printer Robert Boyer. 

The second day is spent out in the field capturing images and learning from Les' capture techniques. On the second evening, participants begin their workflow bringing their images (or ones they brought from home) closer to printing. That includes one-on-one help by Les and Bob. 

On the final day we actually work with each participant to print out their large format images (16" x 24") on the highest museum-quality, archival papers, produced by Museo Fine Art papers. Participants will take these images home for framing and mounting. In addition, each participant will leave with a free packet of sample papers to continue their exploration of printing. Participants will also be exposed to non-paper options for displaying their images.
