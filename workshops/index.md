### What Makes Les' Workshops Special?

Les offers highly customized photo workshops for small groups of photographers. What differentiates Les' workshops are his experience as a widely published photographer, his commitment to small groups, his personal attention to the needs of participants, his excellent instruction, and the quality time spent onsite at iconic and off-the-beaten-path locales. 

In Les' workshops there are never more than 8 participants and some workshops are limited to far fewer. This allows him to devote quality time to each participant.

Les has won several honors for his teaching, first when he was chosen by his peers as Maine's Science Teacher of the Year. While teaching at the University of Delaware, he was named Best Undergraduate Teacher in his college. 

Les' photography has been featured in many publications and shows. He was named Best Travel Photographer for 2011 by the prestigious Canada Northern Lights Award. His work decorates hospitals, offices and private homes. Les was named as a Moab Master Photographer. 

Les believes in the learning-by-doing model. As much time as possible is spent in the field actually capturing images. Evening critiques and instruction are considered the highlight of Les' workshops by many participants. Les also photographs when his participants are not in direct need of his help. At times like those, participants are invited to watch, ask questions, and learn how Les solves photographic challenges in the field, but the emphasis is always on his clients' photography.  

And, as Les' workshop participants have found, their association with Les lasts far beyond the workshop. Les follows the development of his participants, answering their photo questions, even meeting with them or inviting them on unstructured shoots when he is in their area, long after the workshop ends.

The places Les chooses for his workshops are as unique as is Les' instructional techniques. Acadia National Park? Not as most people know it! Les did his doctoral research there and knows places that only he can get to! The Yukon Territory? Les has been there so many times and knows it so well his participants get to photograph places not available to tourists. Sri Lanka? Africa, the Galapagos Islands? Les' contacts make for seamless tours that integrate wildlife, historic sites, landscapes and culture into a travel package that will be the envy of your friends. 

### Two Ways to Participate

At Les Picker Fine Art Photography, we offer two distinct varieties of workshops. 

**Photography Adventures**

Les' photo tours last from two to fourteen days, depending on location. These intense workshops are structured to maximize field time. Each evening there is a critique or instructional session designed to impart new skills, gain new perspectives and share participants' knowledge of and enthusiasm for photography. 

Locations include Acadia National Park (Maine, USA), New Mexico (USA), Yukon Territory (Canada), Sri Lanka, Nepal, Tibet, Bhutan, China, Ecuador, the Galapagos Islands, Peru (Machu Picchu) and other idyllic locations.


**Local Workshops**

These are currently offered as one-day and two-day experiences and take place at Les' studio in the historic Chesapeake Bay town of Havre de Grace, Maryland.  Workshops topics include Fine Art Printing, Black & White Photography, Using Graduated Filters, Composition, Travel Photography and more. Les also offers these workshops customized for other locales. 

**Print Workshops**

Our one-day and two-day print workshops are designed to help beginner to intermediate photographers who wish to learn the art of digital printmaking or improve their printing skills. Our workshops are sponsored by Moab Fine Art Papers. We use Canon large format printers. Les is assisted by Master Printer Robert Boyer. 

Participants print their large format images (17" x 22" and larger) on the highest museum-quality, archival Moab papers. Participants will take these images home for mounting and framing. In addition, each participant will leave with a free packet of sample papers to continue their exploration of printing. Participants will also be exposed to various options for displaying their images. For details on our print workshops, [click here](http://workshops.lesterpickerphoto.com/page/803).
