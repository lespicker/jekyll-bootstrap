# Black & White

## A Sampling of What Participants Have To Say

> As a relative newcomer to Lightroom – and being completely self-taught – I found the workshop with Les and Bob to be invaluable. Many of their tips and advice were bits of information that confirmed the path I was already going down; but they also helped me refine those steps, order them better, use them judiciously, and explore new ones. I feel so much more comfortable with the “convert-to-B&W process,” and I am also applying the knowledge to my color post-processing.I found the most valuable aspects of the workshop was the hands-on, in-person training.<cite>Mary Braman, MD, 2017</cite>

> Thank you so much for your guidance! I absolutely loved the Black and White Workshop! I only wish we had more time. I thought you and Bob did a wonderful job teaching! My only criticism would be, I'd wish we had a little more time. Other than that, I learned a lot and really enjoyed your teaching style and Bob's sense of humor and his vast knowledge, too. I'd love to do another workshop with you guys!<cite>Katie Gonano, MD, 2017</cite>
