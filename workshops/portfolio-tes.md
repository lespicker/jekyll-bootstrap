# Portfolio Workshop

## A Sampling of What Participants Have To Say

> Creating a portfolio of my work had never been on my photographic agenda until I became aware of a workshop with Les Picker.  I first became acquainted with Les on a Nikonians field workshop in Acadia National Park, ME.  Since then I also attended a field school in Sri Lanka.  Both were top notch so I knew I was in for a great experience in creating a portfolio of my own.  I was certainly not disappointed.

> Three other photographers and myself spent a weekend learning how to edit and choose from our images a group of 10-12 photographs that each of us thought would be enjoyed by our friends and customers.  After making our final choices and doing any needed adjustments Les and his assistant Bob printed our images on the Moab paper of our choice.  Vellum prints of the photo titles were made for each photo to be placed in front of each photo.  The final portfolio was placed in a beautiful handmade presentation box.

> Lester Picker's portfolio workshop was a terrific photographic experience. He and Bob expertly use the two days to teach us editing, sequencing and Lightroom skills that combined with their printing and creative input enabled us to produce beautiful portfolios that reflected our work in the best possible way.

> The workshop took place in Les' home studio, an exceptionally spacious, well-equipped and comfortably appointed space. Lesâ€™ gracious wife Leslie provided a warm and welcoming environment and good food to boot.

> All in all a thoroughly enjoyable and productive weekend.<cite>Lewis Rothman MD</cite>

> I have shown my portfolio that I prepared during your workshop to a few potential clients.  They were impressed with the images, but especially the presentation.<cite>Jeffrey Wagoner</cite>
