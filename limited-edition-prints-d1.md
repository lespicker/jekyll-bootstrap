## Limited Edition Prints

Passion. Imagination. Rich and vibrant colors. Black & white images that evoke the panoply of human emotion. Obsessive control over every facet of the print-making process.

At **Les Picker Fine Art Photography** we carefully select the very best of Les' incredible images for his Limited Edition Prints and then nurture them through a meticulous developing and printing process that results in prints that our clients describe as luscious, gorgeous, masterful.

We use only top-of-the-line, heavyweight archival papers and specialty inks, guaranteed to last more than a hundred years. Once our staff selects an image as a Limited Edition Print, it is next handed off to our in-house Master Printmaker, Robert Boyer. We print each image on our Epson 9900 large format printer using Epson archival UltraChrome HDR inks. The papers we use are the highest museum quality archival paper.

Our Limited Editions are truly that. We issue them in highly selected runs of ten or twenty-five. We offer both unframed prints and custom framing using acid-free mattes and UV-protective glass. 

Each print is thoroughly dried, inspected and then hand signed and numbered by Les. Each Limited Edition Print comes with a high security Certificate of Authenticity.

Once the last print of a Limited Edition Print run is sold, it is retired from printing and will only be available on the secondary art market.

Please note that Les is also an editorial photographer. Some of his Limited Edition Print images may be used in magazines or newspapers, which only serves to increase their value for the discriminating collector.
